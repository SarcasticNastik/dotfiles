# Firefox config
My setup for firefox.

- `userChrome.css` contains browser styling for firefox
- `autoconfig.js` and `autoconfig.cfg` allow me to change my default new tab to a custom startpage. The one I use is located in this repository (`/startpages`).

Information about where to put these files for use in firefox can be found with the googles.
Additionally, my startpages are located in this directory. Currently, they consist of ones found on r/startpages, but I intend to write some original ones soon.
