2021-07-17 23:53:32	jim	[18:15:24] MrMobius, one thing you can do, is put an echo in .profile, echo ".profile sourced"
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:15:36] phogg: Those aren't blacklisted.  They're just plain not allowed by the filesystem driver
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:15:43] ...ofr reasons which are obvious.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:15:55] Dagmar: that's what I want to do with a few more, like newline.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	hexnewbie	[18:15:55] Or rather, $'\xe2\x80\xaehello\xe2\x80\xac world'
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:16:08] Everything else is allowed because it _can_ be allowed, and that facilitates people actually using unicode in their filenames if they want
2021-07-17 23:53:32	MrMobius	[18:16:24] phogg, ok added that
2021-07-17 23:53:32	MrMobius	[18:16:34] jim, thanks
2021-07-17 23:53:32	curdlesnoot	[18:16:35] MrMobius: for the nitty gritty, refer to: MANPAGER='less +/^INVOCATION' man bash
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:16:37] Dagmar: any whitelist you propose would have to be close to "all of UTF-8" or it would be pretty limiting
2021-07-17 23:53:32	jim	[18:16:59] MrMobius, and comment it out when you get tired of it :)
2021-07-17 23:53:32	hexnewbie	[18:17:02] For the VFS to whitelist sane characters, it would have to parse UTF-8. ext4 does that now for the purposes of case insensitive, but not by default.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:17:15] The moment you attempt to fix what is essentially another form of in-band signaling by excluding certain characters, you have started down the road to Dismal Failure.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:17:22] hexnewbie: case insensitivity was a terrible idea )-:
2021-07-17 23:53:32	curdlesnoot	[18:17:29] MrMobius: for a script, a "non-interactive" instance of the shell is spawned.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:17:42] You *have* to either start with a mostly-closed set, or just consider that you're simply Doing It Wrong.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:17:54] Dagmar: in principle I agree, however in this specific case the benefits far outweigh the risks
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:18:06] ...and excluding newlines befcause it causes problems for garbagecode is very much an in-band signaling problem.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	hexnewbie	[18:18:09] Non-breaking space, let alone rtl override characters, are way worse in filenames than newlines, and to disallow them you need to parse UTF-8.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	MrMobius	[18:18:10] jim, maybe good to leave it in until i figure things out :P
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:18:36] No, the benefits cannot outweigh the risks because the risks are essentially guarantees.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:18:44] hexnewbie: they're not worse because shells don't have them in IFS
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:18:54] It's not a "risk".  It's a "will happen".
2021-07-17 23:53:32	jim	[18:19:00] MrMobius, maybe so... one thing you can do, is read man bash, just the FILES section
2021-07-17 23:53:32	curdlesnoot	[18:19:08] jim: INVOCATION
2021-07-17 23:53:32	curdlesnoot	[18:19:16] that's where the important detail is.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:19:30] jim: INVOCATION concisely explains exactly which files will be read at which times, and in which order
2021-07-17 23:53:32	koollman_	[18:19:42] I won't argue with anyone arguing that filenames should contain \n , so it's fine. But if I ever get to make my modification, it will be an optional setting anyway :)
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:19:44] Hundreds of exploits caused by being able to stuff a null into a string.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:19:49] _Hundreds_
2021-07-17 23:53:32	jim	[18:19:56] ok, both sections :P
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:19:56] its only fault is that it may be a bit *too* concise, so you could easily skim over important nuances
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:20:02] Red boxes and pay phones.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	hexnewbie	[18:20:07] phogg: Well, you wouldn't think that if you've had to deal with an operator trying to solve the problem of an RBD image (or LV) with a trailing non-breaking space. It's gold. Five operators sit there and think the universe is broken and 2=3
2021-07-17 23:53:32	jim	[18:20:24] when I last read that section, it also explained those things
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:20:27] In-band signaling issues are fail, will always be fail, and will always continue to be fail
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:20:34] koollman_: IMO Linux and GNU between them could solve this via compile-time options, then go back to POSIX with an implementation.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	curdlesnoot	[18:20:45] jim: it's not good if you don't know what a "login shell" is, though.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	curdlesnoot	[18:21:04] INVOCATION defines what makes a login shell a login shell.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	curdlesnoot	[18:21:17] you really do have to read that section also to fully understand it.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:21:19] Stop parsing ls for f**ks sake
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:21:20] hexnewbie: it's a hard thing for the unwary, I'll agree. It's not as broken, though.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	koollman_	[18:21:28] Dagmar: this is more of a mismatch between tools. most unix-inspired tools were written (or at least designed) to use \n as a record separator
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:21:50] Dagmar: parsing ls is the least of it (if you try that you'll break lots of things not involving newline anyway)
2021-07-17 23:53:32	koollman_	[18:22:09] and even while there's "never" a filename with a \n present you *have* to handle the case otherwise someone will tell you that your program is broken ;)
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:22:16] koollman_: So what
2021-07-17 23:53:32	hexnewbie	[18:22:26] phogg: Some would even agree to the point as to suggest forcing nbsp as a solution to spaces in filenames causing issues with parsing ls. I'm sure that would have flown as sane back in the DOS days.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:22:36] koollman_: They would be RIGHT to say the code is broken
2021-07-17 23:53:32	phogg	[18:22:50] hexnewbie: sane is relative
2021-07-17 23:53:32	koollman_	[18:22:58] removing that possibility makes life easier for many, at the cost of angering people that lose one thing to be angry about ;)
2021-07-17 23:53:32	koollman_	[18:23:09] Dagmar: they are technically right, as long as the possibility exist
2021-07-17 23:53:32	Dagmar	[18:23:14] koollman_: Doing that... allowing anything to consider that ANY character in a filename has special meaning (like a record separator) is the in-band signaling problem in a nutshell.
2021-07-17 23:53:32	***	Playback Complete.
2021-07-17 23:53:33	Dagmar	This is a class of problem that has been around for OVER THREE DECADES and people still try and be stupid about it.

2021-07-17 23:53:53	Dagmar	So feel free to join the ranks of the failed by thinking that banning one character is a solution to the problem.

2021-07-17 23:54:18	curdlesnoot	[18:19:16] that's where the important detail is.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	phogg	[18:19:30] jim: INVOCATION concisely explains exactly which files will be read at which times, and in which order
2021-07-17 23:54:18	koollman_	[18:19:42] I won't argue with anyone arguing that filenames should contain \n , so it's fine. But if I ever get to make my modification, it will be an optional setting anyway :)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:19:44] Hundreds of exploits caused by being able to stuff a null into a string.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:19:49] _Hundreds_
2021-07-17 23:54:18	jim	[18:19:56] ok, both sections :P
2021-07-17 23:54:18	phogg	[18:19:56] its only fault is that it may be a bit *too* concise, so you could easily skim over important nuances
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:20:02] Red boxes and pay phones.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	hexnewbie	[18:20:07] phogg: Well, you wouldn't think that if you've had to deal with an operator trying to solve the problem of an RBD image (or LV) with a trailing non-breaking space. It's gold. Five operators sit there and think the universe is broken and 2=3
2021-07-17 23:54:18	jim	[18:20:24] when I last read that section, it also explained those things
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:20:27] In-band signaling issues are fail, will always be fail, and will always continue to be fail
2021-07-17 23:54:18	phogg	[18:20:34] koollman_: IMO Linux and GNU between them could solve this via compile-time options, then go back to POSIX with an implementation.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	curdlesnoot	[18:20:45] jim: it's not good if you don't know what a "login shell" is, though.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	curdlesnoot	[18:21:04] INVOCATION defines what makes a login shell a login shell.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	curdlesnoot	[18:21:17] you really do have to read that section also to fully understand it.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:21:19] Stop parsing ls for f**ks sake
2021-07-17 23:54:18	phogg	[18:21:20] hexnewbie: it's a hard thing for the unwary, I'll agree. It's not as broken, though.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	koollman_	[18:21:28] Dagmar: this is more of a mismatch between tools. most unix-inspired tools were written (or at least designed) to use \n as a record separator
2021-07-17 23:54:18	phogg	[18:21:50] Dagmar: parsing ls is the least of it (if you try that you'll break lots of things not involving newline anyway)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	koollman_	[18:22:09] and even while there's "never" a filename with a \n present you *have* to handle the case otherwise someone will tell you that your program is broken ;)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:22:16] koollman_: So what
2021-07-17 23:54:18	hexnewbie	[18:22:26] phogg: Some would even agree to the point as to suggest forcing nbsp as a solution to spaces in filenames causing issues with parsing ls. I'm sure that would have flown as sane back in the DOS days.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:22:36] koollman_: They would be RIGHT to say the code is broken
2021-07-17 23:54:18	phogg	[18:22:50] hexnewbie: sane is relative
2021-07-17 23:54:18	koollman_	[18:22:58] removing that possibility makes life easier for many, at the cost of angering people that lose one thing to be angry about ;)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	koollman_	[18:23:09] Dagmar: they are technically right, as long as the possibility exist
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:23:14] koollman_: Doing that... allowing anything to consider that ANY character in a filename has special meaning (like a record separator) is the in-band signaling problem in a nutshell.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:23:33] This is a class of problem that has been around for OVER THREE DECADES and people still try and be stupid about it.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	koollman_	[18:23:46] yep. which is why I want to modify it some day
2021-07-17 23:54:18	akik	[18:23:51] isn't the answer "stop doing it"
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:23:53] So feel free to join the ranks of the failed by thinking that banning one character is a solution to the problem.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	phogg	[18:24:02] Dagmar: it's well and good to stamp your foot and say it's broken. It's true, it is broken. But there's little call not to acknowledge that when you have a gotcha that will get everyone the first time, and it is not helping anything, what you have is a bug that should be fixed
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Dagmar	[18:24:10] No.

2021-07-17 23:54:46	phogg	Dagmar: you should read the bug reports about this, which lay out the pro/con better than I am here.
2021-07-17 23:54:57	Dagmar	phogg: Literally three decades.
2021-07-17 23:55:07	phogg	Dagmar: right, but since it's *not helping* and we can change the design, let's do that.
2021-07-17 23:55:15	Dagmar	It's up there with failing to measure buffers correctly in C.
2021-07-17 23:55:21	akik	people travelled to st. petersbug to watch football and bring back covid v. delta. because law allowed it. it was still stupid as
2021-07-17 23:55:28	koollman_	Dagmar: if I was trying for any other characters, I would agree with you. Or of opengroup had standardized tools to have an option for \0 as a separator, maybe
2021-07-17 23:55:31	Dagmar	Yes, do anything other than something that requires single characters be banned from the input

2021-07-17 23:58:55	MrMobius	[18:13:40] phogg, no just echo
2021-07-17 23:58:55	koollman_	[18:13:42] phogg: it's the most annoying character to handle in shell scripts, anything else could be a bonus feature. But specifically newline would reduce pain a lot :)
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:13:54] phogg: Why do you think so many of us have been eyeing those i18n libraries with deep suspicion for well over a decade now?
2021-07-17 23:58:55	curdlesnoot	[18:13:56] MrMobius: rather, they don't invoke the shell in its capacity as a login shell.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	MrMobius	[18:14:28] curdlesnoot, so the script doesnt inherit environment variables from what invokes it?
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:14:41] phogg: LIke I crudely demonstrated with the uparrow thing, a mostly-open approach to detainting is basically _always_ a fail
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:14:45] MrMobius: a shell script should always have at least one other line: the bang line. For example '#!/bin/sh' or '#!/bin/bash'
2021-07-17 23:58:55	curdlesnoot	[18:14:49] MrMobius: no. you've already proven that it does. you complaint morphed into one of not applying changes that are defined in .profile, which is a completely different matter.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	hexnewbie	[18:14:57] Creating a file named '\u202ehello\u202c world' is all sorts of fun (opting out not to paste the name, as it may ruin everyone's IRC clients)
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:15:12] Dagmar: blacklisting NUL and / seems to have been a win so far.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	 *	msiism [18:15:13] thinks control characters and leading hyphens in file names should probably be forbidden by the operating system as a whole.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:15:19] Someone will always find a new thing that wasn't considered before, or just work the space of everything availble until they find a new problem to exploit
2021-07-17 23:58:55	jim	[18:15:24] MrMobius, one thing you can do, is put an echo in .profile, echo ".profile sourced"
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:15:36] phogg: Those aren't blacklisted.  They're just plain not allowed by the filesystem driver
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:15:43] ...ofr reasons which are obvious.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:15:55] Dagmar: that's what I want to do with a few more, like newline.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	hexnewbie	[18:15:55] Or rather, $'\xe2\x80\xaehello\xe2\x80\xac world'
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:16:08] Everything else is allowed because it _can_ be allowed, and that facilitates people actually using unicode in their filenames if they want
2021-07-17 23:58:55	MrMobius	[18:16:24] phogg, ok added that
2021-07-17 23:58:55	MrMobius	[18:16:34] jim, thanks
2021-07-17 23:58:55	curdlesnoot	[18:16:35] MrMobius: for the nitty gritty, refer to: MANPAGER='less +/^INVOCATION' man bash
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:16:37] Dagmar: any whitelist you propose would have to be close to "all of UTF-8" or it would be pretty limiting
2021-07-17 23:58:55	jim	[18:16:59] MrMobius, and comment it out when you get tired of it :)
2021-07-17 23:58:55	hexnewbie	[18:17:02] For the VFS to whitelist sane characters, it would have to parse UTF-8. ext4 does that now for the purposes of case insensitive, but not by default.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:17:15] The moment you attempt to fix what is essentially another form of in-band signaling by excluding certain characters, you have started down the road to Dismal Failure.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:17:22] hexnewbie: case insensitivity was a terrible idea )-:
2021-07-17 23:58:55	curdlesnoot	[18:17:29] MrMobius: for a script, a "non-interactive" instance of the shell is spawned.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:17:42] You *have* to either start with a mostly-closed set, or just consider that you're simply Doing It Wrong.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:17:54] Dagmar: in principle I agree, however in this specific case the benefits far outweigh the risks
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:18:06] ...and excluding newlines befcause it causes problems for garbagecode is very much an in-band signaling problem.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	hexnewbie	[18:18:09] Non-breaking space, let alone rtl override characters, are way worse in filenames than newlines, and to disallow them you need to parse UTF-8.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	MrMobius	[18:18:10] jim, maybe good to leave it in until i figure things out :P
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:18:36] No, the benefits cannot outweigh the risks because the risks are essentially guarantees.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:18:44] hexnewbie: they're not worse because shells don't have them in IFS
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:18:54] It's not a "risk".  It's a "will happen".
2021-07-17 23:58:55	jim	[18:19:00] MrMobius, maybe so... one thing you can do, is read man bash, just the FILES section

2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:25:15] It's up there with failing to measure buffers correctly in C.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	akik	[18:25:21] people travelled to st. petersbug to watch football and bring back covid v. delta. because law allowed it. it was still stupid as

2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:25:31] Yes, do anything other than something that requires single characters be banned from the input
2021-07-17 23:58:55	koollman_	[18:25:53] but, so far, it's pretty insane the amount of additional work most persons writing simple scripts have to go
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:25:54] Dagmar: it's less justifiable than allowing buffer overlflows, and do keep in mind that most code today is written in languages which don't allow rthem
2021-07-17 23:58:55	hexnewbie	[18:25:54] akik: I read that st the terminal
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:26:17] phogg: That doesn't change the fact that this is still an in-band signaling issue
2021-07-17 23:58:55	akik	[18:26:29] hexnewbie: yes the russian terminal disease
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:26:32] In-band signaling is always crude and will always be abuseable
2021-07-17 23:58:55	hexnewbie	[18:26:40] phogg: SQL injections have replaced buffer overflows.

2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:27:40] Now, as to "most code today is written in languages that don't allow them"... Doesn't that suggest to you that possibly there might be a reason it was easier to *change the damn languages* than it was to make people realize what they were doing was stupidly wrong?
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:27:48] whereas the newline problem can bite anyone in a moment of inattention
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:28:01] Nonsense.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	Dagmar	[18:28:05] They're essentially the same problem.
2021-07-17 23:58:55	phogg	[18:28:06] akik: if you presume that your input file names are *trusted* you can pretty much just ignore the pbolem, but I don't presume that

2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:13:42] phogg: it's the most annoying character to handle in shell scripts, anything else could be a bonus feature. But specifically newline would reduce pain a lot :)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:13:54] phogg: Why do you think so many of us have been eyeing those i18n libraries with deep suspicion for well over a decade now?
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:13:56] MrMobius: rather, they don't invoke the shell in its capacity as a login shell.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	MrMobius	[18:14:28] curdlesnoot, so the script doesnt inherit environment variables from what invokes it?
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:14:41] phogg: LIke I crudely demonstrated with the uparrow thing, a mostly-open approach to detainting is basically _always_ a fail
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:14:45] MrMobius: a shell script should always have at least one other line: the bang line. For example '#!/bin/sh' or '#!/bin/bash'
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:14:49] MrMobius: no. you've already proven that it does. you complaint morphed into one of not applying changes that are defined in .profile, which is a completely different matter.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	hexnewbie	[18:14:57] Creating a file named '\u202ehello\u202c world' is all sorts of fun (opting out not to paste the name, as it may ruin everyone's IRC clients)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:15:12] Dagmar: blacklisting NUL and / seems to have been a win so far.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	 *	msiism [18:15:13] thinks control characters and leading hyphens in file names should probably be forbidden by the operating system as a whole.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:15:19] Someone will always find a new thing that wasn't considered before, or just work the space of everything availble until they find a new problem to exploit
2021-07-18 00:01:23	jim	[18:15:24] MrMobius, one thing you can do, is put an echo in .profile, echo ".profile sourced"
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:15:36] phogg: Those aren't blacklisted.  They're just plain not allowed by the filesystem driver
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:15:43] ...ofr reasons which are obvious.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:15:55] Dagmar: that's what I want to do with a few more, like newline.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	hexnewbie	[18:15:55] Or rather, $'\xe2\x80\xaehello\xe2\x80\xac world'
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:16:08] Everything else is allowed because it _can_ be allowed, and that facilitates people actually using unicode in their filenames if they want
2021-07-18 00:01:23	MrMobius	[18:16:24] phogg, ok added that
2021-07-18 00:01:23	MrMobius	[18:16:34] jim, thanks
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:16:35] MrMobius: for the nitty gritty, refer to: MANPAGER='less +/^INVOCATION' man bash
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:16:37] Dagmar: any whitelist you propose would have to be close to "all of UTF-8" or it would be pretty limiting
2021-07-18 00:01:23	jim	[18:16:59] MrMobius, and comment it out when you get tired of it :)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	hexnewbie	[18:17:02] For the VFS to whitelist sane characters, it would have to parse UTF-8. ext4 does that now for the purposes of case insensitive, but not by default.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:17:15] The moment you attempt to fix what is essentially another form of in-band signaling by excluding certain characters, you have started down the road to Dismal Failure.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:17:22] hexnewbie: case insensitivity was a terrible idea )-:
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:17:29] MrMobius: for a script, a "non-interactive" instance of the shell is spawned.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:17:42] You *have* to either start with a mostly-closed set, or just consider that you're simply Doing It Wrong.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:17:54] Dagmar: in principle I agree, however in this specific case the benefits far outweigh the risks
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:18:06] ...and excluding newlines befcause it causes problems for garbagecode is very much an in-band signaling problem.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	hexnewbie	[18:18:09] Non-breaking space, let alone rtl override characters, are way worse in filenames than newlines, and to disallow them you need to parse UTF-8.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	MrMobius	[18:18:10] jim, maybe good to leave it in until i figure things out :P
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:18:36] No, the benefits cannot outweigh the risks because the risks are essentially guarantees.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:18:44] hexnewbie: they're not worse because shells don't have them in IFS
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:18:54] It's not a "risk".  It's a "will happen".
2021-07-18 00:01:23	jim	[18:19:00] MrMobius, maybe so... one thing you can do, is read man bash, just the FILES section
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:19:08] jim: INVOCATION
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:19:16] that's where the important detail is.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:19:30] jim: INVOCATION concisely explains exactly which files will be read at which times, and in which order
2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:19:42] I won't argue with anyone arguing that filenames should contain \n , so it's fine. But if I ever get to make my modification, it will be an optional setting anyway :)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:19:44] Hundreds of exploits caused by being able to stuff a null into a string.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:19:49] _Hundreds_
2021-07-18 00:01:23	jim	[18:19:56] ok, both sections :P
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:19:56] its only fault is that it may be a bit *too* concise, so you could easily skim over important nuances
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:20:02] Red boxes and pay phones.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	hexnewbie	[18:20:07] phogg: Well, you wouldn't think that if you've had to deal with an operator trying to solve the problem of an RBD image (or LV) with a trailing non-breaking space. It's gold. Five operators sit there and think the universe is broken and 2=3
2021-07-18 00:01:23	jim	[18:20:24] when I last read that section, it also explained those things
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:20:27] In-band signaling issues are fail, will always be fail, and will always continue to be fail
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:20:34] koollman_: IMO Linux and GNU between them could solve this via compile-time options, then go back to POSIX with an implementation.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:20:45] jim: it's not good if you don't know what a "login shell" is, though.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:21:04] INVOCATION defines what makes a login shell a login shell.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	curdlesnoot	[18:21:17] you really do have to read that section also to fully understand it.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:21:19] Stop parsing ls for f**ks sake
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:21:20] hexnewbie: it's a hard thing for the unwary, I'll agree. It's not as broken, though.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:21:28] Dagmar: this is more of a mismatch between tools. most unix-inspired tools were written (or at least designed) to use \n as a record separator
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:21:50] Dagmar: parsing ls is the least of it (if you try that you'll break lots of things not involving newline anyway)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:22:09] and even while there's "never" a filename with a \n present you *have* to handle the case otherwise someone will tell you that your program is broken ;)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:22:16] koollman_: So what
2021-07-18 00:01:23	hexnewbie	[18:22:26] phogg: Some would even agree to the point as to suggest forcing nbsp as a solution to spaces in filenames causing issues with parsing ls. I'm sure that would have flown as sane back in the DOS days.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:22:36] koollman_: They would be RIGHT to say the code is broken
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:22:50] hexnewbie: sane is relative
2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:22:58] removing that possibility makes life easier for many, at the cost of angering people that lose one thing to be angry about ;)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:23:09] Dagmar: they are technically right, as long as the possibility exist
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:23:14] koollman_: Doing that... allowing anything to consider that ANY character in a filename has special meaning (like a record separator) is the in-band signaling problem in a nutshell.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:23:33] This is a class of problem that has been around for OVER THREE DECADES and people still try and be stupid about it.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:23:46] yep. which is why I want to modify it some day
2021-07-18 00:01:23	akik	[18:23:51] isn't the answer "stop doing it"
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:23:53] So feel free to join the ranks of the failed by thinking that banning one character is a solution to the problem.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:24:02] Dagmar: it's well and good to stamp your foot and say it's broken. It's true, it is broken. But there's little call not to acknowledge that when you have a gotcha that will get everyone the first time, and it is not helping anything, what you have is a bug that should be fixed
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:24:10] No.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:24:19] What you have is a _failed approach_
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:24:22] It's not a bug.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:24:35] It's no more a bug than something that catches fire when you overheat it.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:24:45] It is an expected result from the design approach.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:24:46] Dagmar: you should read the bug reports about this, which lay out the pro/con better than I am here.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:24:57] phogg: Literally three decades.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:25:07] Dagmar: right, but since it's *not helping* and we can change the design, let's do that.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:25:15] It's up there with failing to measure buffers correctly in C.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	akik	[18:25:21] people travelled to st. petersbug to watch football and bring back covid v. delta. because law allowed it. it was still stupid as
2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:25:28] Dagmar: if I was trying for any other characters, I would agree with you. Or of opengroup had standardized tools to have an option for \0 as a separator, maybe
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:25:31] Yes, do anything other than something that requires single characters be banned from the input
2021-07-18 00:01:23	koollman_	[18:25:53] but, so far, it's pretty insane the amount of additional work most persons writing simple scripts have to go
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:25:54] Dagmar: it's less justifiable than allowing buffer overlflows, and do keep in mind that most code today is written in languages which don't allow rthem
2021-07-18 00:01:23	hexnewbie	[18:25:54] akik: I read that st the terminal
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:26:17] phogg: That doesn't change the fact that this is still an in-band signaling issue
2021-07-18 00:01:23	akik	[18:26:29] hexnewbie: yes the russian terminal disease
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:26:32] In-band signaling is always crude and will always be abuseable
2021-07-18 00:01:23	hexnewbie	[18:26:40] phogg: SQL injections have replaced buffer overflows.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:26:40] No amount of wishing and hoping will change it
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:26:55] Dagmar: I write shell scripts a lot, including as part of my day job. I deal with the real cost of newline being legal constantly. I handle it correctly, but it's not a good things--and it's not *helping* anything. It should not be legal.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:27:16] hexnewbie: only the absolutely ignorant suffer from SQL injections
2021-07-18 00:01:23	akik	[18:27:20] phogg: who creates those files?
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:27:30] akik: there are no files with newlines in the name
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:27:40] Now, as to "most code today is written in languages that don't allow them"... Doesn't that suggest to you that possibly there might be a reason it was easier to *change the damn languages* than it was to make people realize what they were doing was stupidly wrong?
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:27:48] whereas the newline problem can bite anyone in a moment of inattention
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:28:01] Nonsense.

2021-07-18 00:01:23	akik	[18:30:08] haha
2021-07-18 00:01:23	akik	[18:30:15] amazing
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:30:30] Dagmar: if you declared it as invalid THINGS WOULD BREAK, so you cannot do that. Declaring the newline invalid would not do that.

2021-07-18 00:01:23	akik	[18:30:52] i just read today that nasa was able to fix hubble by moving to a backup computer on-board
2021-07-18 00:01:23	phogg	[18:31:04] Again, and I cannot stress this enough, as far as *anyone* can tell there has *never been anyone* who relied on being able to put a newline in the file name.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Dagmar	[18:31:04] phogg: Until someone uses a different record separator

2021-07-18 00:01:33	Dagmar	phogg: Or like the iPhone, decides that since we can now "trust" the input, it's totes fine to pass through as a sprintf pattern or something equally daft
2021-07-18 00:01:35	 *	rascul adds a newline or twelve in every file name

2021-07-18 01:15:18	MrMobius	[18:13:40] phogg, no just echo
2021-07-18 01:15:18	koollman_	[18:13:42] phogg: it's the most annoying character to handle in shell scripts, anything else could be a bonus feature. But specifically newline would reduce pain a lot :)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Dagmar	[18:13:54] phogg: Why do you think so many of us have been eyeing those i18n libraries with deep suspicion for well over a decade now?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	curdlesnoot	[18:13:56] MrMobius: rather, they don't invoke the shell in its capacity as a login shell.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	MrMobius	[18:14:28] curdlesnoot, so the script doesnt inherit environment variables from what invokes it?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Dagmar	[18:14:41] phogg: LIke I crudely demonstrated with the uparrow thing, a mostly-open approach to detainting is basically _always_ a fail
2021-07-18 01:15:18	phogg	[18:14:45] MrMobius: a shell script should always have at least one other line: the bang line. For example '#!/bin/sh' or '#!/bin/bash'
2021-07-18 01:15:18	curdlesnoot	[18:14:49] MrMobius: no. you've already proven that it does. you complaint morphed into one of not applying changes that are defined in .profile, which is a completely different matter.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	hexnewbie	[18:14:57] Creating a file named '\u202ehello\u202c world' is all sorts of fun (opting out not to paste the name, as it may ruin everyone's IRC clients)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	phogg	[18:15:12] Dagmar: blacklisting NUL and / seems to have been a win so far.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	 *	msiism [18:15:13] thinks control characters and leading hyphens in file names should probably be forbidden by the operating system as a whole.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Dagmar	[18:15:19] Someone will always find a new thing that wasn't considered before, or just work the space of everything availble until they find a new problem to exploit
2021-07-18 01:15:18	jim	[18:15:24] MrMobius, one thing you can do, is put an echo in .profile, echo ".profile sourced"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:15:36] phogg: Those aren't blacklisted.  They're just plain not allowed by the filesystem driver
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:15:43] ...ofr reasons which are obvious.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:15:55] Dagmar: that's what I want to do with a few more, like newline.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:15:55] Or rather, $'\xe2\x80\xaehello\xe2\x80\xac world'
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:16:08] Everything else is allowed because it _can_ be allowed, and that facilitates people actually using unicode in their filenames if they want
2021-07-18 01:15:19	MrMobius	[18:16:24] phogg, ok added that
2021-07-18 01:15:19	MrMobius	[18:16:34] jim, thanks
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:16:35] MrMobius: for the nitty gritty, refer to: MANPAGER='less +/^INVOCATION' man bash
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:16:37] Dagmar: any whitelist you propose would have to be close to "all of UTF-8" or it would be pretty limiting
2021-07-18 01:15:19	jim	[18:16:59] MrMobius, and comment it out when you get tired of it :)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:17:02] For the VFS to whitelist sane characters, it would have to parse UTF-8. ext4 does that now for the purposes of case insensitive, but not by default.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:17:15] The moment you attempt to fix what is essentially another form of in-band signaling by excluding certain characters, you have started down the road to Dismal Failure.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:17:22] hexnewbie: case insensitivity was a terrible idea )-:
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:17:29] MrMobius: for a script, a "non-interactive" instance of the shell is spawned.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:17:42] You *have* to either start with a mostly-closed set, or just consider that you're simply Doing It Wrong.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:17:54] Dagmar: in principle I agree, however in this specific case the benefits far outweigh the risks
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:18:06] ...and excluding newlines befcause it causes problems for garbagecode is very much an in-band signaling problem.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:18:09] Non-breaking space, let alone rtl override characters, are way worse in filenames than newlines, and to disallow them you need to parse UTF-8.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	MrMobius	[18:18:10] jim, maybe good to leave it in until i figure things out :P
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:18:36] No, the benefits cannot outweigh the risks because the risks are essentially guarantees.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:18:44] hexnewbie: they're not worse because shells don't have them in IFS
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:18:54] It's not a "risk".  It's a "will happen".
2021-07-18 01:15:19	jim	[18:19:00] MrMobius, maybe so... one thing you can do, is read man bash, just the FILES section
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:19:08] jim: INVOCATION
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:19:16] that's where the important detail is.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:19:30] jim: INVOCATION concisely explains exactly which files will be read at which times, and in which order
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:19:42] I won't argue with anyone arguing that filenames should contain \n , so it's fine. But if I ever get to make my modification, it will be an optional setting anyway :)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:19:44] Hundreds of exploits caused by being able to stuff a null into a string.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:19:49] _Hundreds_
2021-07-18 01:15:19	jim	[18:19:56] ok, both sections :P
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:19:56] its only fault is that it may be a bit *too* concise, so you could easily skim over important nuances
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:20:02] Red boxes and pay phones.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:20:07] phogg: Well, you wouldn't think that if you've had to deal with an operator trying to solve the problem of an RBD image (or LV) with a trailing non-breaking space. It's gold. Five operators sit there and think the universe is broken and 2=3
2021-07-18 01:15:19	jim	[18:20:24] when I last read that section, it also explained those things
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:20:27] In-band signaling issues are fail, will always be fail, and will always continue to be fail
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:20:34] koollman_: IMO Linux and GNU between them could solve this via compile-time options, then go back to POSIX with an implementation.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:20:45] jim: it's not good if you don't know what a "login shell" is, though.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:21:04] INVOCATION defines what makes a login shell a login shell.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:21:17] you really do have to read that section also to fully understand it.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:21:19] Stop parsing ls for f**ks sake
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:21:20] hexnewbie: it's a hard thing for the unwary, I'll agree. It's not as broken, though.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:21:28] Dagmar: this is more of a mismatch between tools. most unix-inspired tools were written (or at least designed) to use \n as a record separator
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:21:50] Dagmar: parsing ls is the least of it (if you try that you'll break lots of things not involving newline anyway)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:22:09] and even while there's "never" a filename with a \n present you *have* to handle the case otherwise someone will tell you that your program is broken ;)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:22:16] koollman_: So what
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:22:26] phogg: Some would even agree to the point as to suggest forcing nbsp as a solution to spaces in filenames causing issues with parsing ls. I'm sure that would have flown as sane back in the DOS days.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:22:36] koollman_: They would be RIGHT to say the code is broken
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:22:50] hexnewbie: sane is relative
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:22:58] removing that possibility makes life easier for many, at the cost of angering people that lose one thing to be angry about ;)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:23:09] Dagmar: they are technically right, as long as the possibility exist
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:23:14] koollman_: Doing that... allowing anything to consider that ANY character in a filename has special meaning (like a record separator) is the in-band signaling problem in a nutshell.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:23:33] This is a class of problem that has been around for OVER THREE DECADES and people still try and be stupid about it.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:23:46] yep. which is why I want to modify it some day
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:23:51] isn't the answer "stop doing it"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:23:53] So feel free to join the ranks of the failed by thinking that banning one character is a solution to the problem.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:24:02] Dagmar: it's well and good to stamp your foot and say it's broken. It's true, it is broken. But there's little call not to acknowledge that when you have a gotcha that will get everyone the first time, and it is not helping anything, what you have is a bug that should be fixed
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:24:10] No.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:24:19] What you have is a _failed approach_
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:24:22] It's not a bug.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:24:35] It's no more a bug than something that catches fire when you overheat it.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:24:45] It is an expected result from the design approach.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:24:46] Dagmar: you should read the bug reports about this, which lay out the pro/con better than I am here.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:24:57] phogg: Literally three decades.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:25:07] Dagmar: right, but since it's *not helping* and we can change the design, let's do that.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:25:15] It's up there with failing to measure buffers correctly in C.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:25:21] people travelled to st. petersbug to watch football and bring back covid v. delta. because law allowed it. it was still stupid as
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:25:28] Dagmar: if I was trying for any other characters, I would agree with you. Or of opengroup had standardized tools to have an option for \0 as a separator, maybe
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:25:31] Yes, do anything other than something that requires single characters be banned from the input
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:25:53] but, so far, it's pretty insane the amount of additional work most persons writing simple scripts have to go
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:25:54] Dagmar: it's less justifiable than allowing buffer overlflows, and do keep in mind that most code today is written in languages which don't allow rthem
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:25:54] akik: I read that st the terminal
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:26:17] phogg: That doesn't change the fact that this is still an in-band signaling issue
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:26:29] hexnewbie: yes the russian terminal disease
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:26:32] In-band signaling is always crude and will always be abuseable
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:26:40] phogg: SQL injections have replaced buffer overflows.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:26:40] No amount of wishing and hoping will change it
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:26:55] Dagmar: I write shell scripts a lot, including as part of my day job. I deal with the real cost of newline being legal constantly. I handle it correctly, but it's not a good things--and it's not *helping* anything. It should not be legal.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:27:16] hexnewbie: only the absolutely ignorant suffer from SQL injections
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:27:20] phogg: who creates those files?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:27:30] akik: there are no files with newlines in the name
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:27:40] Now, as to "most code today is written in languages that don't allow them"... Doesn't that suggest to you that possibly there might be a reason it was easier to *change the damn languages* than it was to make people realize what they were doing was stupidly wrong?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:27:48] whereas the newline problem can bite anyone in a moment of inattention
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:28:01] Nonsense.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:28:05] They're essentially the same problem.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:28:06] akik: if you presume that your input file names are *trusted* you can pretty much just ignore the pbolem, but I don't presume that
2021-07-18 01:15:19	 *	msiism [18:28:19] bites a newline problem before he gets bitten by it.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:28:47] ALlowing anything in user input to be treated specially as a field separator or what have you is fail from the start
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:28:53] little bobby tables
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:29:03] Hell, we've even got an ongoing issue that's remarkably similar with iPhones
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:29:10] Dagmar: they certainly have similarities from a technical point of view, but no they're not in the same league. You can't change C to stop allowing buffer overflows without breaking C, and tons and tons of programs that are written in it
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:29:17] akik: nobody creates them, use them, and afaik, need them. But the mere possibility that it could be part of the input makes for a lot of problems
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:29:24] but, as far as anyone can tell, *no one* relies on newline in the file name
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:29:34] msiism: The eaten newline problem attacks you from the inside. Now your antibodies think they are fighting two problems, because they don't handle newlines correctly
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:29:51] Right now if you so much as _touch_ an AP with obvious sprintf tokens (%s, %p in particular) in the AP name, your iPhone's wireless will ragequit and be UNABLE TO START AGAIN without a factory reset of the phone
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:30:06] Is it even remotely reasonable to declare the percent sign invalid in an AP name?  Heck no
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:30:08] haha
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:30:15] amazing
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:30:30] Dagmar: if you declared it as invalid THINGS WOULD BREAK, so you cannot do that. Declaring the newline invalid would not do that.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:30:44] Thou Shalt Not Allow User Input To Be Confused With Control Codes
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:30:52] i just read today that nasa was able to fix hubble by moving to a backup computer on-board
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:31:04] Again, and I cannot stress this enough, as far as *anyone* can tell there has *never been anyone* who relied on being able to put a newline in the file name.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:31:04] phogg: Until someone uses a different record separator
2021-07-18 01:15:19	 *	msiism [18:31:05] sets his internal field separator to $'\0'.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:31:33] phogg: Or like the iPhone, decides that since we can now "trust" the input, it's totes fine to pass through as a sprintf pattern or something equally daft
2021-07-18 01:15:19	 *	rascul [18:31:35] adds a newline or twelve in every file name
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:31:57] Dagmar: those kinds of bugs are tangential to the issue
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:32:07] THey're the _same_ issue
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:32:22] Dagmar: they are most certainly not.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:32:29] They all come down to user input being even considered for a _second_ to possibly contain special codes
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:32:41] People can be doing two unsafe things today and we can fix it so that one is no longer unsafe, but that doesn't make the other safe.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:32:49] Enjoy your failure
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:32:54] But if you were doing only one unsafe thing then you are no longer unsafe.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	NeilRG	[18:32:58] any sed pros here?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:33:15] NeilRG: better just to ask your question and then find out
2021-07-18 01:15:19	NeilRG	[18:33:22] how do I use sed to strip out everything after a space? This doesn't seem to work: s/\(.*\)\{0,1\}\( .*\)/\1/p
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:33:31] I did run into someone arguing they needed binary strings not containing NULL, when newline-less UTF-8 was proposed somewhere.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:33:53] NeilRG: What is \(.*\)\{0,1\}\ supposed to be doing in there?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:33:56] NeilRG: mostly because that regex has nothing to do with spaces
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:34:15] NeilRG: 's/ .*//' ?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	NeilRG	[18:34:27] koollman_, oh good idea
2021-07-18 01:15:19	[[R]]	[18:34:38] phogg: you're a space
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:34:38] NeilRG: /\( \).*/\1/
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:34:53] NeilRG: that will strip everything after a space on a line, but not the space
2021-07-18 01:15:19	NeilRG	[18:35:05] I want everything before the space
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:35:06] hexnewbie: Binary strings can contain null, so long as one is never ever using string functions that consider a \x00 to be the end marker
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:35:12] NeilRG: naughty naughty! wait a few minutes before cross-posting.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:35:17] well, if you want to keep the space, 's/ .*/ /' would also be easier to read :)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	NeilRG	[18:35:21] curdlesnoot, sorry!
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:35:23] ;)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:35:41] NeilRG: if you want the space stripped, too, then koollman's is what you want. If you want ALL consecutive spaces to also be removed then s/[[:space:]]*.*//'
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:36:11] Wasted CPU
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:36:15] which will also remove \t and \v, but at that point you probably want that
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:36:26] phogg: the first example still works :)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:36:50] phogg: unnecessary. s/[[:space:]].*// would do just as well.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:36:51] yours is what I would do, but I also don't write the user's requirement
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[18:37:01] Nobody is ever sure if they want to strip \f or not, though ;)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:37:08] Making the space match more than one character in succession is pointless.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:37:15] curdlesnoot: until you have 'foo  bar' and you don't want 'foo ' at the end
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:37:15] hopefully the compiler optimizes that out
2021-07-18 01:15:19	koollman_	[18:37:45] I don't think sed optimizes much
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:37:59] Dagmar: it depends on where the parser makes its decision
2021-07-18 01:15:19	curdlesnoot	[18:38:22] phogg: echo 'foo  bar' | sed -e 's/[[:space:]].*//' | od -a # looks fine to me (should be obvious, really)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:38:30] I just know that it's very liktly that the Mad Arab is alive and well and has been ghost-coding for sed's regular expression compiler
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:38:33] in isolation what curdlesnoot says is correct, in a portion of a more complex regex it *may* be correct
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:39:30] it's safest to be very clear about where you are anchoring your match so that what it looks like you're doing and what the matcher will actually do are the same
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:42:37] So anchor to the left
2021-07-18 01:15:19	geirha	[18:43:05] the other left
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:43:22] It's not anchored to anything right now
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:43:56] Being explicit with regular expressions avoid surprises including CPU-wasteful matching
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:44:23] ...and if you think it doesn't matter all that much, try managing a Proofpoint install
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:44:49] They boldly ask the question, "What if we write individual regular expressions for each and every type of spam we've seen"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[18:45:42] Occasionally a mentally-deficient match slips in, and then at some point in the day, mail flow just _stops_ with 100% CPU utilization
2021-07-18 01:15:19	geirha	[18:47:13] some quick testing shows that there's no difference with anchoring on the right or not, and anchoring on the left is slower (probably since it makes the regex more complex)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	 *	rascul [18:53:21] cuts the anchor line
2021-07-18 01:15:19	[[R]]	[18:56:02] rascul: you're ship will drift away
2021-07-18 01:15:19	akik	[18:56:33] [[R]]: you're a ship too
2021-07-18 01:15:19	compdoc	[18:56:50] Im more of a boat
2021-07-18 01:15:19	rascul	[18:58:02] get off my boat
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[18:58:17] geirha: what are you using to test that? Just curious
2021-07-18 01:15:19	[[R]]	[18:59:37] 🎶 i'm on a boat...
2021-07-18 01:15:19	rascul	[18:59:53] not for long
2021-07-18 01:15:19	 *	rascul [18:59:56] pushes [[R]] off the boat
2021-07-18 01:15:19	geirha	[19:01:55] phogg: I did  /msg shbot time for x in {1..30}; do sed 's/ .*//' <<< 'abc def'; done >/dev/null
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:05:10] geirha: my experiments with this have been using perl and Regex::Debugger, which is of course not the same engine but makes the difference between "good anchor choice" and "bad anchor choice" starkly clear
2021-07-18 01:15:19	geirha	[19:06:42] mh, but perl's regular expressions are also an order of magnitude more complex than the standard regex dialects
2021-07-18 01:15:19	jim	[19:07:21] does that make perl rexesps gooder?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	geirha	[19:07:44] They're certainly more powerful
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:08:04] geirha: some things seem to work out much the same. Perl will sometimes be more optimized, but it won't be less
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:08:41] if you confine yourself to ERE/BRE features then the behavior will be a "best case" outcome
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:11:27] geirha: You need to use an input pattern that's more complex is all
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:11:54] 'abc def ghi jkl mno pqr stu vwx yfu'
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:12:42] _THen_ it actually matters if your regular expression is doing the thing that was expressed.  With just two words and one space, there's basically no way to get it _wrong_
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:13:26] Always pick an input pattern that could be misinterpreted when testing regular expressions.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:13:31] Your user for damn sure will.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:13:44] just 'foo  bar  baz' is enough to see the difference in effort
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:13:58] Oooho doubled-spaces.  Good catch
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:14:20] that was kind of the point
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:15:30] I was mainly thinking of how many times i"ve gotten burned by not anchoring a match
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:15:46] anyway, if you say / .*/ it's about 3 times more efficient
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:16:06] because you can stop checking sooner
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:16:16] Is there something in the POSIX spec that mandates starting from the left of the string?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:16:26] but if you embed that in another expression you could easily start having a bad time
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:16:44] "I tested this thoroughly in isolation, why is it not doing the right thing when I use it for real?"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:16:50] Truth
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:16:55] Dagmar: just common sense, I suppose
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:17:08] your pointer starts on the left of the string
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:17:26] I'm wondering about the spec because of how many times not binding to one end or the other has blown up.  RPN has shown us that people will screw up even the simplest of math
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:17:57] ...all they need is for something to be undefined, and you're off to the races
2021-07-18 01:15:19	jim	[19:18:23] unless you fail to define races :)
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:18:54] I'm not really willing to trust an external knowledge of how the strings work, because that smells remarkably like casually ignoring byte-order and inet_ntoa functions, "becuause it's just a long integer"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:19:15] "...and everyone knows all long integers are the same"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	kurahaupo	[19:25:14] Dagmar: of course. Everyone knows that long ints are 80±48 bits.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:25:48] ...and are always least-significant bits first, right?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	kurahaupo	[19:26:01] no, in the middle
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:26:04] Ahhh
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:26:48] I know someone I can ask about the spec thing.  It'll just be a couple days before I talk to him again
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:26:59] which spec thing?
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:27:04] I wasn't trying to pose some hypothetical speedbump
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:27:17] Whether or not the spec that defines regular expressions mandates beginning the search from the left
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:27:58] It _feels_ like the sort of thing someone writing a spec might deliberately leave out to avoid being ethniocentric, with a side order of "anyone who assumes this gets what they deserve"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:28:30] Dagmar: I would home so
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:28:32] Like how POSIX is conspiciously "silent" on whether or not having usernames that are just numbers is f**king stupid
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:28:56] In theory it could be allowed. In practice it's unpleasant.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:29:09] In practice it's dumb
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:29:23] many things in POSIX are unfortunately "read between the lines" stuff, rather than "for clarity we will spell it out for you"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:29:48] as a consequence of X and Y, don't do Z. But we won't tell you the Z part.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:29:53] I think that one is just a amtter of it being dumb
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[19:29:59] 1314:x:1000:1000::/home/1314:/bin/bash
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:30:08] Like horizontal referrals, it can really only end in tears
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:30:50] hexnewbie: And the moment you expose that 'username' to any function which can automatically take a username or a uid, your code breaks
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:31:41] It makes more sense to either people use two functions for the two types of input parameters, or make them to any translation themselves and have one lookup function
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:31:57] or use in band signaling
2021-07-18 01:15:19	 *	phogg [19:31:58] ducks
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:32:18] ...but _without_ mandating that specific thing, the only option is the make the reasonable deduction that simply translating between one number and another is just silly.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:32:30] phogg: Dude, literally payphones.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:32:42] Play beepy tone into phone, get free call.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:32:49] That's how long this class of f**kery has been around.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:32:56] Telegraph operators knew this
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:34:01] Names exist as such because humans are more able to remember them
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:34:23] If this weren't the case, people would have started strictly enumerating their kids about the time we invented algebra
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:34:48] For everyone but Catholics, you could pretty much describe your family history with a ten-digit sequence
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[19:34:50] Some names would beg to differ
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:35:30] Yeah I've seen some actors names lately that make me acutely aware of some ethniocentrism, because my first thought was "did someone spill something on the keyboard"
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:35:45] ...and then there's those who are like, you *know* their parents didn't pick that name.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	hexnewbie	[19:36:04] Unless the  parent was Elon Musk
2021-07-18 01:15:19	[[R]]	[19:36:14] papa musk
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:36:49] One of the actors in Debris (who plays an especially serious murder-villain) has the name of 'Scroobius Pip'
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:36:55] It's right there in the credits at the start of the show
2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:37:08] Little question marks appear over my head every time I see that

2021-07-18 01:15:19	Dagmar	[19:38:52] If I had kids I would just give them 'NULL' for a _middle_ name
2021-07-18 01:15:19	phogg	[19:42:24] Dagmar: what's the difference between a person with a middle name of NULL and a person with no middle name?

2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:30:51] I just install multi-format card reader in the 3.5" bay of every PC I build now
2021-07-18 04:51:01	lericson	[20:31:12] i actually had a floopy disk in my hands the other day
2021-07-18 04:51:01	akik	[20:31:23] hehe so lazy
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Kre10s	[20:32:40] Hello. I have a small SBC with an HDD attached. If I am notified of a power failure a few seconds before it hapens how can I best power down the disk?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:33:29] Let nature take it's course
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Kre10s	[20:33:37] I get the notification by way of the power button. So an orderly shutdown is triggered. Is there something special I can do to prioritize the disk? The rest of the os can crash for all I care
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:33:38] What you _really_ want to do is _stop writes_
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:33:58] Pfft if it's an orderly shutdown everything will take care of itself
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Kre10s	[20:33:59] YES!
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:34:26] Everything will be killed and hte kernel will complete any remaining buffer flushes all by itself
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[R]]	[20:34:45] Kre10s: you can run sync 3 times
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Kre10s	[20:34:48] there might not be enough power reserves to shut down completely. But I should have a few hundred ms to fi. prevent fresh writes and maybe terminate an ongoing one.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:35:18] What you need then is a miracle
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:36:23] If you forcibly interrupt the kernel writing, you'll just be more than a little flirting with data corruption
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:36:56] At least with a journaling filesystem, the chances of the result being catastrophic are fairly low
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Kre10s	[20:38:21] yea. the last protection is ultimately the journal... is there a way to speed up shutown?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Kre10s	[20:38:36] like don't bother tearing down network interfaces?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:38:43] Yeah, ensure the machine is fully idle all the time
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:38:58] You don't need to "tear down" network interfaces in any case
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:39:44] The only thing that could _possibly_ be useful for is explcitly relenquishing a DHCP lease to free up IP addresses more readily, but that's the network adminstrator's problem so f**k him
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Kre10s	[20:39:48] it takes about 15s to shut down normally... so If the disk is idle. what takes so long?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:40:08] Look at what's using CPU then
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:41:23] If you have X running and don't need it, stop doing that.  It takes time for X to exit and free up the resources
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Dagmar	[20:41:55] past that the biggest culprit is systemd doing things only systemd cares about (generally)

2021-07-18 04:51:01	bewees	[21:01:19] [[R]]: thanks, but it looks like it doesn't accept a systemd unit to start but wants to start my process directly
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[R]]	[21:01:53] well it'll run any script you want
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[R]]	[21:02:01] and said script can do whatever you want, including start a unit
2021-07-18 04:51:01	bewees	[21:02:13] rascul: yes that's what I read here too: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/126146/108542 ... for newer systems systemd-networkd-wait-online.service shouldnt be required to be enabled
2021-07-18 04:51:01	phogg	[21:02:15] aww, I missed all the talk about null.

2021-07-18 04:51:01	bewees	[21:02:51] maybe I have an XY problem. after reboot libvirt fails to add the VMs virtual network devices to the host's bridge, only if I restart libvirtd manually it's added

2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[21:03:27] good idea
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:03:37] bewees why does it fail?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	bewees	[21:04:29] rascul: Not sure, there's no error message indicating it fails to add the virtual network device to the bridgfe
2021-07-18 04:51:01	bewees	[21:04:52] I assumed it must be, because I masked  systemd-networkd-wait-online a while ago
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:05:11] does unmasking it solve the issue?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:05:32] also any error would presumably be noted in the journal
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[21:05:33] kfrench: sneaky sneaky
2021-07-18 04:51:01	bewees	[21:07:04] rascul: good question, I avoided unmasking because I remember I had lots of issues with systemd-networkd-wait-online, but I can give it a try
2021-07-18 04:51:01	kubast2	[21:07:06] Hey, how can I recognize if "FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE", isn't supported by the underlying filesystem.

2021-07-18 04:51:01	kubast2	[21:09:24] yeah I just noticed the line

2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:37:54] currently attempting to setup a new mail server
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:37:59] 2nd attempt so far
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:38:31] TheWild:  no, make them use .NET to decrypt the message, that will leave them seething
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:38:45] Heh, attempting? But.. Mail servers are easy. 🙂
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:38:56] dang I hate dudes who park IRC usernames for common words, 'no' --> I'm looking at you. Super annoying
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:39:08] ah not for me
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TheWild	[21:39:18] lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:39:20] I failed miserably with the OpenBSD guide I tried for the past 2 months on and off
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TheWild	[21:39:26] hmm... good idea
2021-07-18 04:51:01	hello1	[21:39:35] eh, reserved
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:39:35] I tried mailing lists for both OpenBSD, and Dovecot, but yeah the guide itself was flawed
2021-07-18 04:51:01	 *	hello1 [21:39:48] I
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:39:49] it never went into SMTP, so I found a better Debian 10 based guide
2021-07-18 04:51:01	I	[21:40:00] that's it
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:40:09] Wafficus`: What mail server software are you trying to use?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:40:13] TheWild: yeah pretty sure XLib lets you do that
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest8437	[21:41:02] I was taken as well... um, I mean 'I' was taken as well.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Kre10s	[21:46:04] how can I find out what poweroff -f skips as oposed to poweroff with no arguments?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:46:56] what does the man page say?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	kfrench	[21:47:51] rascul: It says: See the description of --force in systemctl(1) for more details.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	hassoon	[21:48:02] it says that i'm the man page of whatever you're looking the man page for
2021-07-18 04:51:01	hassoon	[21:48:08] meh whatever
2021-07-18 04:51:01	hassoon	[21:48:10] g'day
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:48:19] what does the fox say?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:48:26]  poweroff
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:48:26]            Shut down and power-off the system. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start poweroff.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block, but also prints a wall message to all users. This
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:48:26]            command is asynchronous; it will return after the power-off operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:48:26]            If combined with --force, shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or mounted read-only, immediately followed by the
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:48:27]            powering off. If --force is specified twice, the operation is immediately executed without terminating any processes or unmounting any file systems. This may result in data loss. Note that when
2021-07-18 04:51:01	hassoon	[21:48:28] the fox?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:48:30]            --force is specified twice the power-off operation is executed by systemctl itself, and the system manager is not contacted. This means the command should succeed even when the system manager has
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:48:33]            crashed.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	hassoon	[21:48:40] VG9t: lmfao you blew us all
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:48:43] VG9t please don't paste large amounts of text to the channel
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[21:49:08] sorry thought that would send as one message
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:49:32] either way, use a pastebin for blocks of text
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:50:11] also, i'm curious if your question is answered after reading that
2021-07-18 04:51:01	yogoyo	[21:52:15] i always been okay with systemd until i wanted to use it today
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:52:22] I don't even see a question.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[21:52:41] went by too fast?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	yogoyo	[21:52:46] devuan is a debian flavour without systemd, right?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[21:52:59] I think so yes
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:52:59] yogoyo: No.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[21:53:07] it wasn't VG9t's question, even.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Nosrep	[21:53:09] yes
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Nosrep	[21:53:18] also
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:53:19] yogoyo: Devuan is Devuan. Forked from Debian.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Nosrep	[21:53:19] artix
2021-07-18 04:51:01	 *	[[[R]]] [21:53:28] sticks a fork in Psi-Jack 
2021-07-18 04:51:01	schuelermine	[21:53:36] tbqh I like systemd’s structure (as a service manager)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[21:53:38] does it have systemd or not?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Nosrep	[21:53:40] no
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[21:53:55] schuelermine: of course you do... its the cats whiskers
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:53:59] They specifically forked Devuan from Debian to not use systemd.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[21:54:04] schuelermine: i do so much cool stuff because of systemd
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:54:09] devuan is based on debian
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:54:12] Whether or not it has it available, I've no idea.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[21:54:16] rascul: what are you based on?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:54:19] beer
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:54:20] rascul: Hence, fork.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	yogoyo	[21:54:23] [[[R]]]: why do you wrap more and more in brackets?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:54:31] Psi-Jack it's not the traditional fork though
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[21:54:35] "is a debian flavor" sounds accurate
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[21:54:40] yogoyo: see its the summer here, and the AC is on, and it gets cold when the AC is on
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:54:43] each devuan release is based on each debian release
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:54:45] Yes, the traditional fork. Nobody on Debian works on Devuan. 🙂
2021-07-18 04:51:01	yogoyo	[21:54:51] aha
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:55:06] traditional fork's don't rebase every release
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:55:14] "Flavor" would mean that someone else of the same community works on it. They do not.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	schuelermine	[21:55:19] I understand that people don’t like the “lock-in” systemd supposedly engenders—I don’t experience it much, I don’t need anything that’s blocked by it—but if there was a service manager w/o the other systemd parts that worked like that, that’d be great
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[21:55:33] yogoyo, are you looking to install something like that?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[21:56:05] i guess you could say that each devuan release is a separate fork of each debian release
2021-07-18 04:51:01	yogoyo	[21:56:20] jim: not sure yet. i wanted to look at arch flavours/forks too
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:56:22] rascul: Or just a fork. Because they don't even share repositories.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[21:56:39] the distinction Psi-Jack raises, could go to whether you trust it
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:56:45] dang, yeah I didn't realize I would need at least 1.25 gigs RAM for this mail server setup
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:56:54] Wafficus`: You don't.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:57:03] why can't there be a guide with minimal overhead, geez. Why can't I win
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:57:18] Wafficus`: Just depends entirely on what you want/need in your total setup.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:57:41] If you want anti-virus/malware scanning on email, you'll need 4GB RAM, period.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:57:59] I just realized it because I restarted nginx since modoboa uses it as its backend for the web interface and saw the OOM issues because of the ClamAV and Amavis dependencies
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[21:58:00] Psi-Jack, you're raising the channel temperature with pedantics, please don't.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:58:02] Otherwise, you could technically run a mail server on 512MB.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:58:16] jim: I will provide accurate answers. Period.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	bewees	[21:58:19] is it a bad idea to disable netfilter on bridges or is it a bad not do so?   net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
2021-07-18 04:51:01	schuelermine	[21:58:37] where is the relevance in the distinction between a fork that is developed independently and one that is a modification and one that is called a flavour
2021-07-18 04:51:01	bewees	[21:58:39] +idea
2021-07-18 04:51:01	schuelermine	[21:58:47] it is not relevant to this discussion
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:58:49] I basically followed this guide until the 'After Modoboa finishes installation, you can log into the admin panel' section and realized it: https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/debian-10-buster-modoboa
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[21:58:49] relax, breathe, run around the block a few thousand times...
2021-07-18 04:51:01	 *	yogoyo [21:59:16] does so .... *plopp* (yay, my chair let me go)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[21:59:23] jim: I am quite relaxed actually. Breathing however is a bit difficult with sinusitis, though.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[21:59:24] schuelermine: the 'flavor' releases are only for like Linux Desktop enthusiasts that want different DE's from what I see
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[22:00:15] well, here's to nuking yet another VPS instance again. Literally the 2GB tier for Vultr would be like $120 a year just for this kind of mail server project alone. There's gotta be an easier way
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:00:35] Wafficus`: Generally that's accurate. Ubuntu and Fedora are prime examples of this.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:00:53] low usage mail servers can run fine in 512mb depending on your requirements
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:01:04] rascul: Heh, I just said that. 🙂
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:01:09] i missed it
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:01:15] oh i see it now
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:01:33] I mentioned it takes 4GB for anti-virus/malware, but without that....
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[22:01:37] yeah but following that guide will be impossible unless I disable Amavis and ClamAV
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:01:51] And with amaviz/clamav, you need 4GB RAM.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:02:00] Ain't no getting around it.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:02:00] since when?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[22:02:02] author of that blog post said 1.25 GB ram, dang
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:02:16] Since loading clamd takes 2~3GB RAM loading up. heh
2021-07-18 04:51:01	 *	Wafficus` [22:02:17] puts hands up in the air and walks out of the house, debates why he tries doing this
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:02:26] a few years ago i was running amavis and clamav in 1gb on my mail server
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:02:42] with plenty still available but i don't recall exact numbers
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[22:03:06] easy mode would be just fork over the $120 per year for the 2GB VPS on Vultr, but its just funny because that's DOUBLE what I pay for Fastmail already, kind of dumb comparatively
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:03:14] easy mode is fastmail
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[22:03:32] yeah I'm already doing it, but hating myself
2021-07-18 04:51:01	VG9t	[22:03:54] Just write your own lightweight mail server :)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[22:03:56] I just want to self host, just one of those life goals I wanted to do. Most people will say "Don't do it dude". Don't care, want to at least try it
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:04:23] rascul: Heh. I actually omitted running clamav on my latest setup, simply because, I don't need it.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:04:38] And, because, it allowed me to run on a DO-VPS of 2GB RAM.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:04:54] nice
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:04:55] Combined though, with MySQL, nginx, multi-version php-fpm,.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest92	[22:04:59] The reason I dont setup myself a mail server is that I dont want my emails to end in spams
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:05:02] wow that is neat
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:05:11] Wafficus` there's a lot to it, and it can be a pain when you end up on blocklists or google suddendly doesn't like you
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:05:18] Psi-Jack 2 gb is a bit less than needed?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:05:24] will it function well?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:05:53] i have inboxed ok so far
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:05:55] Psi-Jack mysql, nginx, php have no place ever on any mail server of mine
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:05:56] Well, my VPS uses 860M RAM now, with the rest being caches. And this does include rspamd for spam.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	 *	themachine [22:06:08] hosts his own mail and loves it
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest92	[22:06:09] You have to setup SPF, DKIM and DMARC if im not wrong
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:06:22] rascul: Heh, I merged 2 4GB servers into 1 2GB server. 🙂
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Wafficus`	[22:06:31] rascul: do you know of an easier setup guide with a light weight approach? I've already failed twice with this
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:06:42] rascul yes why would one need php on on a webserver
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:06:43] Wafficus` postfix and dovecot both have some guides
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:06:45] and mysql
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:07:00] rascul simply setup mail client and off you go
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:07:01] guest_2183_afw mysql can be a backend, and there are some php admin interfaces
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest92	[22:07:11] mailcow.email ?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:07:12] Wafficus`
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:07:13] guest_2183_afw we're talking about mail servers
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:07:15] Yeah, I use mysql with Postfix.Admin
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:07:33] php can have vulbs
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:07:36] vulns
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:07:46] everything can have vulnerabilities though
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest92	[22:07:53] or mailinabox.email
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:08:56] rascul since you here - mail server setup involves auth part such as dkim, spf - interface part - webmail or something - and actual mail server install part ?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:09:15] Wafficus` if you're using postfix then you'll spend a whole lot of time here   http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:09:28] guest_2183_afw depends on the use case
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:09:38] but generally you probably want most if not all of those things
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:10:03] in addition to others
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:10:12] simply install smtp and pop or imap
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:10:13] :)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	onelegend	[22:10:16] the only port open for my mail server is the smtp port. If someone wants to use IMAP or the php webadmin inteface, they can use an ssh tunnel
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:10:24] "mail server" is actually a bit ambiguous and can include many separate services
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:10:31] configure dns mx records and done
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:10:40] yes mail server can be incoming or out lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:10:44] rascul: like the ambiguously gay duo?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:10:54] rascul: That explains why it felt like there's half a conversation. 🙂
2021-07-18 04:51:01	onelegend	[22:11:12] [[[R]]]: how many [[[[[[[[[[
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:23] and yes some extra web client in case of marketing
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:11:27] onelegend: do you think i need another one?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:28] or managing others emails
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:11:34] guest_2183_afw it's really not so simple
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:41] rascul is is very simple
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:44] it is
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:49] which part is not? :)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:12:11] pretty much all of it
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:12:21] set up mx records, dkim, spf, in and out mail server web panel - goo
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:12:42] its not like you are writing some software from scratch :)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:12:43] lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	oerheks	[22:12:53] you bring it simple, but it is not.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:13:07] oerheks once more what is not simple
2021-07-18 04:51:01	oerheks	[22:13:28] maintaining and monitoring an email service ..
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:13:44] monitoring such as?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	onelegend	[22:13:46] I'm not afraid of someone "hacking" my IMAP port. Because ITS NOT EVEN OPEN.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	onelegend	[22:13:55] SSH TUNNELS MOTHAFUCKA
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:13:57] Even when I first setup a mail server ages ago, I never found it to be difficult, ever, and that was back when I used exim. Which was horrific for a mail server, but postfix wasn't very popular or well developed at the time yet. heh
2021-07-18 04:51:01	oerheks	[22:14:02] such as .. go read about it?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:14:16] Psi-Jack bingo its piece of cake lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:14:19] cyrus-imapd is the only mail software I found to be difficult, and IT, specifically is.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	oerheks	[22:14:21] i think it is not worth the trouble.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest92	[22:14:49] Remember folks, downtime for a mail server is no joke and you need to keep your VPS up to date.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:14:55] it doesn't have to be difficult but it's certainly not as simple as "install something, setup dns record, done"
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:15:17] rascul yet you cant give a single example of difficult
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:15:22] can you? lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	onelegend	[22:15:23] Psi-Jack: do you use roundcube webmail?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:15:40] guest_2183_afw i never once said it was difficult
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:15:42] Depending on what you want, it can be that simple. Generally all you "need", to get going is SMTP, SPF, and a means to get your email, whether that's mbox, Maildir, IMAP, or POP.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:15:46] ok
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:15:50] onelegend: I use Rainloop.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	onelegend	[22:16:05] oh nice
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:16:14] what is rainloop?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:16:17] DKIM is optional, DMARC is optional, but helps.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:16:32] spf was still mostly optional a few years ago
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:16:41] onelegend: Yeah. I went with Rainloop because I can run it independantly, and as an app in Nextcloud.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:16:52] what is i?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:17:06] some email server app?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:17:20] webmail
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:17:25] ty
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:17:27] *webmail client
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:17:41] i prefer to have none in case it has bugs/vulns
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:18:06] min setup
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:18:09] heh, Main reason I even have Rainloop is primarily for my sieve filtering rules.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest92	[22:18:10] You also have https://www.sogo.nu
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest92	[22:18:24] You can try a demo
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Guest92	[22:18:35] bottom of website
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:19:36] As in, Rainloop provides a very clean effective use of Sieve rules in the webui. Otherwise, Sieve is a royal PITA to maintain as-is since various email clients don't support it, and Thunderbird, one of TWO that supported it, it's extension is so old and outdated it won't even work anymore.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:19:52] Other email client is kmail, but... Kmail is KDE, and broken like the rest of KDE as far as I'm concerned.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	onelegend	[22:20:10] I don't see anything wrong or insecure with webmail. Just use client certificate authentication or access it through an ssh tunnel
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:20:40] nothing is inherently insecure about webmail if proper auth and encryption is setup
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:20:45] onelegend: Hmm? Why? AppArmor/SELinux, OSSEC, etc.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:21:04] Prevent it, rather than find out about it after-the-fact,.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:21:14] i hate ossec lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:21:23] apparmor is nice
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:24:03] if size :over 10000000000K {

2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:24:06] filtering is nice
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Sauvin	[22:24:40] guest_2183_afw, use English.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:25:16] need another " and a }
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:25:37] Sauvin not everyone is a native English speaker lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:25:37] hey, is there a "cleaner" way to run mpv (or other program) from command line such that it doesn't "block" the command line, and also doesn't close when that pty closes?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Sauvin	[22:25:56] guest_2183_afw, my first language wasn't English, either.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:26:06] I use nohup command > /dev/null & this works fine, but it's got that extra ugly outputs and also info about the background job...
2021-07-18 04:51:01	akik	[22:26:24] pyzozord: output them to /dev/null
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:26:34] pyzozord: you could run it in screen...
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:26:48] pyzozord: disown
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:26:50] pyzozord i have a script to do that, i call it 'b', so that i can just do 'b kwrite' or so    https://termbin.com/suzbz
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:26:51] Sauvin not everyone is a Chopen of English lol its not that important unless you are a translator
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:27:00] pyzozord: Run it in the background &, and disown it.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	henistein	[22:27:16] please explain me how is this possible: https://streamable.com/c0xrc2

2021-07-18 04:51:01	Sauvin	[22:27:21] What's a "Chopen"?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:27:29] [[[R]]] don't hold your breath though
2021-07-18 04:51:01	akik	[22:27:40] maybe chopin with a typo
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:28:01] Psi-Jack: is there a way to get automate it into a function? How do I get jobspec or pid when I do command &
2021-07-18 04:51:01	guest_2183_afw	[22:28:09] yes chopin

2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:29:34] Psi-Jack: not sure how tat would work
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:29:38] henistein: and did you really need a whole video just for that?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:29:52] pyzozord did you see the script i shared?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	schuelermine	[22:30:00] henistein: you may be interested in Asciinema (https://asciinema.org/)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:30:08] rascul: no missed, that. Thanks
2021-07-18 04:51:01	schuelermine	[22:30:10] (let’s you record terminal sessions)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	henistein	[22:30:14] I thought that if that was not filmed someone would call me crazy
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:30:17] pyzozord   https://termbin.com/suzbz
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:30:29] henistein: i think you're more crazy for not just asking a simple question
2021-07-18 04:51:01	henistein	[22:30:40] alright
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:30:53] rascul: yep yep go it, just text scrolled up too fast first time and I didn't realize there was a link
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:30:56] [[[R]]]: maybe you're crazy, maybe we're crazy, probably ...
2021-07-18 04:51:01	henistein	[22:31:02] sorry for something, I will investigate about binfmt_misc
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:31:54] rascul: how does this work, it looks like disown -h would mark all jobs
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:32:47] "Without any JOBSPECs, the shell uses its notion of the current job."
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:33:08] Yes. disown will do the last job.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:33:10] oh i see
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:33:14] Without optional jobspec|pid
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:33:19] from 'help disown'
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:33:26] what's &>>
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:33:28] or bash -c "help disown" 🙂
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:33:41] &>> is append stdout and stderr
2021-07-18 04:51:01	 *	Psi-Jack [22:33:49] lost access to bash's "help" from using zsh everywhere.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:34:01] Psi-Jack clearly the problem is that you use zsh
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:34:10] heh, yet, I like zsh. 🙂
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:34:18] i knew there was something wrong with you
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:34:22] I do miss the help command though.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Sauvin	[22:34:34] Gots man pages? O:)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:34:43] why do "$1" "${@:2}" &>> ${b_out:-/dev/null} &, not just $@ &>> ${b_out:-/dev/null} &
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:34:49] zsh's manpages for internal functions are one of it's downsides.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:35:27] pyzozord to ensure arguments are passed correctly, i don't remember exactly, it's been probably a couple decades since i wrote that
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:36:37] i think phogg has something very similar and may know the answer
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:36:49] last question, how to prevent process ran like this from outputing to my console?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:36:54] it won't
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:37:17] my script has all output go to ~/.b.out by default
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:37:26] you don't need to disown in that script, anyway. it's not an interactive bash shell and no HUP will be sent upon exiting. not even an interactive login shell will, for that matter.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:37:54] I did simpler version $@ >/dev/null & why does my version still output to the console?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:37:54] pyzozord: you can get the pid with command & pid=$!
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:38:13] curdlesnoot i had to put it in there in the past because when i closed the terminal emulator the apps started did close with it
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:38:46] pyzozord because you're only redirecting stdout and not stderr
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:39:41] oh that's the &> part
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:39:44] in bash you can use &> instead of > to get both
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:40:04] rascul: perfect, thanks
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:40:06] TIL!
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:42:21] rascul: bash -c 'sleep 600 &'. that's a non-interactive shell, obviously. check with pgrep -a sleep afterwards. then close the interactive instance of bash you ran that from and check from another. should still be there. maybe you had huponexit enabled in the past.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:42:36] curdlesnoot maybe i did, i dunno
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:43:07] rascul: i'll hup you
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[22:43:07] pyzozord, it would be better if you spelled out TIL as today I learned from now on
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:43:13] rascul: anyway, let me know if that isn't true in your case.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:43:23] What? TIL is a very common acronym!
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:43:28] NOT SMS speak.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:43:33] here we go ...
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:43:54] 🎶 come with me...
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:44:20] what's SMS speak?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	jim	[22:44:38] Psi-Jack, if you;d like to discuss the rules or applications thereof, you would need to do it on #linux-ops
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:44:39] jim: I'll actually consider that
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:44:47] pyzozord: Things like "u", "thx", "ty", "oic", etc.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:44:58] Psi-Jack: don't forget about 'hbu'
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:45:10] I've never even seen 'hbu'. heh
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:45:29] Psi-Jack: i had someone who was 36 send me that... i had to face palm
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:45:33] 'how bout you'
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:45:39] ... Wow...
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:45:59] Yeah, that one's pretty bad. heh
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[22:46:15] Am looking at a solution like TigerVNC, but TigerVNC does not seem to have proper relative mouse coordinates. This breaks almost everything that has an FPS perspective (e.g. many games, simulations, etc.). Is there something equally as fast, preferably open-source, that's not broken in this regard?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:46:38] you're trying to play a game over vnc!?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:46:49] and the mouse is your biggest concern?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:46:49] lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:46:55] heh
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[22:49:05] Not primarily looking at gaming, no. But it's an example of a massive breakage... and Tiger is *faster* than anything else I've seen, so it would actually be possible.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	pyzozord	[22:49:05] thanks guys!

2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:49:43] well but its a stupid example...
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[22:49:44] rodolfo: will this work for the traditional use case of full desktop access? open source?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:50:59] I can't seem to remember how I reformatted a Seagate drive from 512e to 4kn. google is letting me down (it might have been with openSeaChest, or maybe with sg_format) Can someone remember for me?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:51:36] what is 512e and 4kn?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:52:09] 512 electrons, 4 krabby nuts
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:52:35] rascul, that is what seagate calls them, 512 byte blocks (emulated) and 4k blocks (native)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rascul	[22:52:52] oh
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:53:43] You don't "format" as that, you partition as that.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:53:47] I had one of my 16TB Seagates die after <1year and I finally got a replacement (thanks Chia)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:53:48] you don't have control over how the hard drive is formatted at the low-level.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	oerheks	[22:53:58] " Seagate drive from 512e to 4kn"  1st hit https://www.seagate.com/support/software/seachest/
2021-07-18 04:51:01	 *	[[[R]]] [22:53:59] creates a new partition in Psi-Jack 
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:53:59] Psi-Jack, it really is a 'FastFormat' not a partition
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:54:11] you might have had a switch to enable 512e mode though. or maybe they implement is a firmware setting.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	oerheks	[22:54:28] use that seagate tool
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:54:38] oerheks, I think it was with openSeaChest (the version that will compile for linux)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:54:52] The weird thing is the tools weren't compiled in my source tree
2021-07-18 04:51:01	oerheks	[22:55:12] the download gives a lin64 verion too
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:55:47] Gonna try doing it with ./openSeaChest_FormatUnit
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:56:50] ossifrage: Beyond the partition itself, there's block size in the filesystem itself, which is specific between filesystem formats.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:57:17] Psi-Jack, this has nothing to do with the partition, it is a property of the physical drive
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[22:57:25] Okay, Ignore the help. Good luck.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:57:38] The drive can say "I have 512 byte blocks" or "I have 4096 byte blocks"
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[22:58:03] yeah. 512e or otherwise exposing the real physical block size.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ossifrage	[22:58:07] Out of the box it says, 512, but I've already switched the other drives in the raid group to 4096, so the new one does as well
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:58:11] if the drive talks, and no one is listening, does it really make a sound?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	[[[R]]]	[22:58:20] curdlesnoot: naked!?

2021-07-18 04:51:01	rodolfo	[23:00:41] TomTheDragon: games, with a hack some apps only. Far from open source.

2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[23:03:09] rodolfo: yeah, looks like it'd be a bear to setup for anything other than games... looks like it's going to be strapping a bunch of python/gstreamer/pulseaudio/libinput stuff together for me
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[23:03:56] rodolfo: and, disgustingly, actually writing an Xserver... wow, maybe that's why no solution exists
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rodolfo	[23:04:30] TomTheDragon: in fact i do not understand your "problem to solve"
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[23:05:20] Nobody seems to at this point, yet. 🙂
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rodolfo	[23:05:25] TomTheDragon: you just need to access a windows machine? rdp/ts session?
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rodolfo	[23:05:40] Psi-Jack: lol
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[23:06:51] It's a trivial issue, need to accsess a remote Linux machine, but need some form of relative mouse support, or "input redirection" (where it's like the actual kb/mouse is connected to the remote X server)
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[23:07:30] That's not a trivial issue.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[23:08:50] Pretty much any VM software I've seen seems to support this.

2021-07-18 04:51:01	rodolfo	[23:09:33] curdlesnoot: high five!
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[23:10:33] rodolfo: I think you were talking about X11 forwarding? the above article concerns a different matter.

2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[23:12:25] Heh, wow... using xinput and xdotool, via python over ssh. Yikes. Sounds unpleasant as heck.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	curdlesnoot	[23:12:37] TomTheDragon: as you can see, the request to implement relative positioning in TigerVNC was fulfilled. the problem may remain with your server, though.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	rodolfo	[23:12:41] curdlesnoot: my fault
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[23:12:42] Oh, interesting, now that is actually useful! Now I know TigerVNC has some patch supposed to fix game controls but.. limited to that, difficult to compile, and doesn't even seem to fix glitchy mouse.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	TomTheDragon	[23:13:19] I've actually compiled the server, and the client. The server is a bear to compile... probably because Xorg itself is tough

2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[23:19:42] Hmmmm... xpra, maybe x2go. Never used xpra to date yet.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[23:19:48] Actually, I might've, and hated it.
2021-07-18 04:51:01	akik	[23:20:00] sure thing
2021-07-18 04:51:01	ThiefMaster	[23:20:15] hi, what could cause this error? "modprobe: FATAL: Module cdc-acm not found in directory /lib/modules/5.10.27-gentoo"? the module exists in /lib/modules/5.10.27-gentoo/kernel/drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.ko and `insmod` with that path works fine
2021-07-18 04:51:01	Psi-Jack	[23:20:28] yeaaah, I remember xpra now. And yes, I absolutely personally disliked it.

2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[21:09:13] kubast2: try to use it... if it fails, it isn't supported
2021-07-18 05:12:20	kubast2	[21:09:24] yeah I just noticed the line

2021-07-18 05:12:20	msiism	[21:21:22] Guest92: Also, I'd say it is maybe not the best idea to include characters in file names that are treated specially by the shell.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Dagmar	[21:21:35] Odd... It doesn't even care if the bridge goes anywhere

2021-07-18 05:12:20	Dagmar	[21:21:48] I can't imagine why it would balk at adding things to a bridge

2021-07-18 05:12:20	TheWild	[21:24:22] folks, a character map for terminal? Not really interactive, rather something I can use like `charmap 1F300-1F3FF`, `charmap greek`, `charmap arrows` and it gives me a list of characters, or do I have to write it myself (easy task)?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[21:24:38] msiism, which characters are you talking about?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	kfrench	[21:27:20] A bridge to nowhere?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	msiism	[21:27:23] Guest92: Control characters, whitespace, all "metacharacters" and "control operators" named in bash(1).
2021-07-18 05:12:20	msiism	[21:28:52] I use the following scheme for file names: <field>[--<field>]… and `_` as the word separator within fields.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:28:55] control operator i think you mean
2021-07-18 05:12:20	bewees	[21:29:02] rascul: fixed the error, now there are no errors left but bridges still not added, let me check libvirts bug tracker

2021-07-18 05:12:20	byte4byte_	[21:30:31] and since some people find it offensive to be called nerd they should have to call me king

2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kre10s	[21:46:04] how can I find out what poweroff -f skips as oposed to poweroff with no arguments?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:46:56] what does the man page say?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	kfrench	[21:47:51] rascul: It says: See the description of --force in systemctl(1) for more details.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	hassoon	[21:48:02] it says that i'm the man page of whatever you're looking the man page for
2021-07-18 05:12:20	hassoon	[21:48:08] meh whatever
2021-07-18 05:12:20	hassoon	[21:48:10] g'day
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:48:19] what does the fox say?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[21:48:26]  poweroff
2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[21:48:26]            Shut down and power-off the system. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start poweroff.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block, but also prints a wall message to all users. This
2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[21:48:26]            command is asynchronous; it will return after the power-off operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[21:48:26]            If combined with --force, shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or mounted read-only, immediately followed by the
2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[21:48:27]            powering off. If --force is specified twice, the operation is immediately executed without terminating any processes or unmounting any file systems. This may result in data loss. Note that when
2021-07-18 05:12:20	hassoon	[21:48:28] the fox?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[21:48:30]            --force is specified twice the power-off operation is executed by systemctl itself, and the system manager is not contacted. This means the command should succeed even when the system manager has
2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[21:48:33]            crashed.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	hassoon	[21:48:40] VG9t: lmfao you blew us all

2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[21:49:08] sorry thought that would send as one message
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:49:32] either way, use a pastebin for blocks of text
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:50:11] also, i'm curious if your question is answered after reading that
2021-07-18 05:12:20	yogoyo	[21:52:15] i always been okay with systemd until i wanted to use it today
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:52:22] I don't even see a question.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[21:52:41] went by too fast?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	yogoyo	[21:52:46] devuan is a debian flavour without systemd, right?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[21:52:59] I think so yes
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:52:59] yogoyo: No.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[21:53:07] it wasn't VG9t's question, even.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Nosrep	[21:53:09] yes
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Nosrep	[21:53:18] also
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:53:19] yogoyo: Devuan is Devuan. Forked from Debian.

2021-07-18 05:12:20	 *	[[[R]]] [21:53:28] sticks a fork in Psi-Jack 
2021-07-18 05:12:20	schuelermine	[21:53:36] tbqh I like systemd’s structure (as a service manager)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[21:53:38] does it have systemd or not?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Nosrep	[21:53:40] no
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[21:53:55] schuelermine: of course you do... its the cats whiskers
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:53:59] They specifically forked Devuan from Debian to not use systemd.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[21:54:04] schuelermine: i do so much cool stuff because of systemd
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:54:09] devuan is based on debian
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:54:12] Whether or not it has it available, I've no idea.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[21:54:16] rascul: what are you based on?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:54:19] beer
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:54:20] rascul: Hence, fork.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	yogoyo	[21:54:23] [[[R]]]: why do you wrap more and more in brackets?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:54:31] Psi-Jack it's not the traditional fork though
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[21:54:35] "is a debian flavor" sounds accurate
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[21:54:40] yogoyo: see its the summer here, and the AC is on, and it gets cold when the AC is on
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:54:43] each devuan release is based on each debian release
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:54:45] Yes, the traditional fork. Nobody on Debian works on Devuan. 🙂
2021-07-18 05:12:20	yogoyo	[21:54:51] aha
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:55:06] traditional fork's don't rebase every release
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:55:14] "Flavor" would mean that someone else of the same community works on it. They do not.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	schuelermine	[21:55:19] I understand that people don’t like the “lock-in” systemd supposedly engenders—I don’t experience it much, I don’t need anything that’s blocked by it—but if there was a service manager w/o the other systemd parts that worked like that, that’d be great
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[21:55:33] yogoyo, are you looking to install something like that?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[21:56:05] i guess you could say that each devuan release is a separate fork of each debian release
2021-07-18 05:12:20	yogoyo	[21:56:20] jim: not sure yet. i wanted to look at arch flavours/forks too
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:56:22] rascul: Or just a fork. Because they don't even share repositories.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[21:56:39] the distinction Psi-Jack raises, could go to whether you trust it
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[21:56:45] dang, yeah I didn't realize I would need at least 1.25 gigs RAM for this mail server setup
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:56:54] Wafficus`: You don't.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[21:57:03] why can't there be a guide with minimal overhead, geez. Why can't I win
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:57:18] Wafficus`: Just depends entirely on what you want/need in your total setup.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:57:41] If you want anti-virus/malware scanning on email, you'll need 4GB RAM, period.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[21:57:59] I just realized it because I restarted nginx since modoboa uses it as its backend for the web interface and saw the OOM issues because of the ClamAV and Amavis dependencies
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[21:58:00] Psi-Jack, you're raising the channel temperature with pedantics, please don't.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:58:02] Otherwise, you could technically run a mail server on 512MB.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:58:16] jim: I will provide accurate answers. Period.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	bewees	[21:58:19] is it a bad idea to disable netfilter on bridges or is it a bad not do so?   net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
2021-07-18 05:12:20	schuelermine	[21:58:37] where is the relevance in the distinction between a fork that is developed independently and one that is a modification and one that is called a flavour
2021-07-18 05:12:20	bewees	[21:58:39] +idea
2021-07-18 05:12:20	schuelermine	[21:58:47] it is not relevant to this discussion
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[21:58:49] I basically followed this guide until the 'After Modoboa finishes installation, you can log into the admin panel' section and realized it: https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/debian-10-buster-modoboa
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[21:58:49] relax, breathe, run around the block a few thousand times...
2021-07-18 05:12:20	 *	yogoyo [21:59:16] does so .... *plopp* (yay, my chair let me go)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[21:59:23] jim: I am quite relaxed actually. Breathing however is a bit difficult with sinusitis, though.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[21:59:24] schuelermine: the 'flavor' releases are only for like Linux Desktop enthusiasts that want different DE's from what I see
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[22:00:15] well, here's to nuking yet another VPS instance again. Literally the 2GB tier for Vultr would be like $120 a year just for this kind of mail server project alone. There's gotta be an easier way
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:00:35] Wafficus`: Generally that's accurate. Ubuntu and Fedora are prime examples of this.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:00:53] low usage mail servers can run fine in 512mb depending on your requirements
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:01:04] rascul: Heh, I just said that. 🙂
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:01:09] i missed it
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:01:15] oh i see it now
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:01:33] I mentioned it takes 4GB for anti-virus/malware, but without that....
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[22:01:37] yeah but following that guide will be impossible unless I disable Amavis and ClamAV
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:01:51] And with amaviz/clamav, you need 4GB RAM.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:02:00] Ain't no getting around it.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:02:00] since when?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[22:02:02] author of that blog post said 1.25 GB ram, dang
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:02:16] Since loading clamd takes 2~3GB RAM loading up. heh
2021-07-18 05:12:20	 *	Wafficus` [22:02:17] puts hands up in the air and walks out of the house, debates why he tries doing this
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:02:26] a few years ago i was running amavis and clamav in 1gb on my mail server
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:02:42] with plenty still available but i don't recall exact numbers
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[22:03:06] easy mode would be just fork over the $120 per year for the 2GB VPS on Vultr, but its just funny because that's DOUBLE what I pay for Fastmail already, kind of dumb comparatively
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:03:14] easy mode is fastmail
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[22:03:32] yeah I'm already doing it, but hating myself
2021-07-18 05:12:20	VG9t	[22:03:54] Just write your own lightweight mail server :)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[22:03:56] I just want to self host, just one of those life goals I wanted to do. Most people will say "Don't do it dude". Don't care, want to at least try it
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:04:23] rascul: Heh. I actually omitted running clamav on my latest setup, simply because, I don't need it.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:04:38] And, because, it allowed me to run on a DO-VPS of 2GB RAM.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:04:54] nice
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:04:55] Combined though, with MySQL, nginx, multi-version php-fpm,.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[22:04:59] The reason I dont setup myself a mail server is that I dont want my emails to end in spams
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:05:02] wow that is neat
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:05:11] Wafficus` there's a lot to it, and it can be a pain when you end up on blocklists or google suddendly doesn't like you
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:05:18] Psi-Jack 2 gb is a bit less than needed?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:05:24] will it function well?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:05:53] i have inboxed ok so far
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:05:55] Psi-Jack mysql, nginx, php have no place ever on any mail server of mine
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:05:56] Well, my VPS uses 860M RAM now, with the rest being caches. And this does include rspamd for spam.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	 *	themachine [22:06:08] hosts his own mail and loves it
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[22:06:09] You have to setup SPF, DKIM and DMARC if im not wrong
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:06:22] rascul: Heh, I merged 2 4GB servers into 1 2GB server. 🙂
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Wafficus`	[22:06:31] rascul: do you know of an easier setup guide with a light weight approach? I've already failed twice with this
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:06:42] rascul yes why would one need php on on a webserver
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:06:43] Wafficus` postfix and dovecot both have some guides
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:06:45] and mysql
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:07:00] rascul simply setup mail client and off you go
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:07:01] guest_2183_afw mysql can be a backend, and there are some php admin interfaces
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[22:07:11] mailcow.email ?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:07:12] Wafficus`
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:07:13] guest_2183_afw we're talking about mail servers
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:07:15] Yeah, I use mysql with Postfix.Admin
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:07:33] php can have vulbs
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:07:36] vulns
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:07:46] everything can have vulnerabilities though
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[22:07:53] or mailinabox.email
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:08:56] rascul since you here - mail server setup involves auth part such as dkim, spf - interface part - webmail or something - and actual mail server install part ?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:09:15] Wafficus` if you're using postfix then you'll spend a whole lot of time here   http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:09:28] guest_2183_afw depends on the use case
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:09:38] but generally you probably want most if not all of those things
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:10:03] in addition to others
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:10:12] simply install smtp and pop or imap
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:10:13] :)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[22:10:16] the only port open for my mail server is the smtp port. If someone wants to use IMAP or the php webadmin inteface, they can use an ssh tunnel
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:10:24] "mail server" is actually a bit ambiguous and can include many separate services
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:10:31] configure dns mx records and done
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:10:40] yes mail server can be incoming or out lol
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:10:44] rascul: like the ambiguously gay duo?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:10:54] rascul: That explains why it felt like there's half a conversation. 🙂
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[22:11:12] [[[R]]]: how many [[[[[[[[[[
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:23] and yes some extra web client in case of marketing
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:11:27] onelegend: do you think i need another one?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:28] or managing others emails
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:11:34] guest_2183_afw it's really not so simple
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:41] rascul is is very simple
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:44] it is
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:11:49] which part is not? :)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:12:11] pretty much all of it
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:12:21] set up mx records, dkim, spf, in and out mail server web panel - goo
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:12:42] its not like you are writing some software from scratch :)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:12:43] lol
2021-07-18 05:12:20	oerheks	[22:12:53] you bring it simple, but it is not.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:13:07] oerheks once more what is not simple
2021-07-18 05:12:20	oerheks	[22:13:28] maintaining and monitoring an email service ..
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:13:44] monitoring such as?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[22:13:46] I'm not afraid of someone "hacking" my IMAP port. Because ITS NOT EVEN OPEN.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[22:13:55] SSH TUNNELS MOTHAFUCKA
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:13:57] Even when I first setup a mail server ages ago, I never found it to be difficult, ever, and that was back when I used exim. Which was horrific for a mail server, but postfix wasn't very popular or well developed at the time yet. heh
2021-07-18 05:12:20	oerheks	[22:14:02] such as .. go read about it?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:14:16] Psi-Jack bingo its piece of cake lol
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:14:19] cyrus-imapd is the only mail software I found to be difficult, and IT, specifically is.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	oerheks	[22:14:21] i think it is not worth the trouble.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[22:14:49] Remember folks, downtime for a mail server is no joke and you need to keep your VPS up to date.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:14:55] it doesn't have to be difficult but it's certainly not as simple as "install something, setup dns record, done"
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:15:17] rascul yet you cant give a single example of difficult
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:15:22] can you? lol
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[22:15:23] Psi-Jack: do you use roundcube webmail?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:15:40] guest_2183_afw i never once said it was difficult
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:15:42] Depending on what you want, it can be that simple. Generally all you "need", to get going is SMTP, SPF, and a means to get your email, whether that's mbox, Maildir, IMAP, or POP.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:15:46] ok
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:15:50] onelegend: I use Rainloop.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[22:16:05] oh nice
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:16:14] what is rainloop?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:16:17] DKIM is optional, DMARC is optional, but helps.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:16:32] spf was still mostly optional a few years ago
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:16:41] onelegend: Yeah. I went with Rainloop because I can run it independantly, and as an app in Nextcloud.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:16:52] what is i?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:17:06] some email server app?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:17:20] webmail

2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:17:41] i prefer to have none in case it has bugs/vulns
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:18:06] min setup
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:18:09] heh, Main reason I even have Rainloop is primarily for my sieve filtering rules.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[22:18:10] You also have https://www.sogo.nu
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[22:18:24] You can try a demo
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Guest92	[22:18:35] bottom of website
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:19:36] As in, Rainloop provides a very clean effective use of Sieve rules in the webui. Otherwise, Sieve is a royal PITA to maintain as-is since various email clients don't support it, and Thunderbird, one of TWO that supported it, it's extension is so old and outdated it won't even work anymore.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:19:52] Other email client is kmail, but... Kmail is KDE, and broken like the rest of KDE as far as I'm concerned.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[22:20:10] I don't see anything wrong or insecure with webmail. Just use client certificate authentication or access it through an ssh tunnel
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:20:40] nothing is inherently insecure about webmail if proper auth and encryption is setup
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:20:45] onelegend: Hmm? Why? AppArmor/SELinux, OSSEC, etc.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:21:04] Prevent it, rather than find out about it after-the-fact,.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:21:14] i hate ossec lol
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:21:23] apparmor is nice

2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:25:37] hey, is there a "cleaner" way to run mpv (or other program) from command line such that it doesn't "block" the command line, and also doesn't close when that pty closes?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Sauvin	[22:25:56] guest_2183_afw, my first language wasn't English, either.

2021-07-18 05:12:20	akik	[22:27:40] maybe chopin with a typo
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:28:01] Psi-Jack: is there a way to get automate it into a function? How do I get jobspec or pid when I do command &
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:28:09] yes chopin
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:28:10] pyzozord: jobs
2021-07-18 05:12:20	guest_2183_afw	[22:28:20] also it is who is a chopen? :)

2021-07-18 05:12:20	schuelermine	[22:29:24] henistein: what is the problem
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:29:34] Psi-Jack: not sure how tat would work
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:29:38] henistein: and did you really need a whole video just for that?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:29:52] pyzozord did you see the script i shared?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	schuelermine	[22:30:00] henistein: you may be interested in Asciinema (https://asciinema.org/)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:30:08] rascul: no missed, that. Thanks
2021-07-18 05:12:20	schuelermine	[22:30:10] (let’s you record terminal sessions)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	henistein	[22:30:14] I thought that if that was not filmed someone would call me crazy
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:30:17] pyzozord   https://termbin.com/suzbz
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:30:29] henistein: i think you're more crazy for not just asking a simple question
2021-07-18 05:12:20	henistein	[22:30:40] alright
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:30:53] rascul: yep yep go it, just text scrolled up too fast first time and I didn't realize there was a link
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:30:56] [[[R]]]: maybe you're crazy, maybe we're crazy, probably ...
2021-07-18 05:12:20	henistein	[22:31:02] sorry for something, I will investigate about binfmt_misc
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:31:54] rascul: how does this work, it looks like disown -h would mark all jobs
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:32:47] "Without any JOBSPECs, the shell uses its notion of the current job."
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:33:08] Yes. disown will do the last job.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:33:10] oh i see
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:33:14] Without optional jobspec|pid
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:33:19] from 'help disown'
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:33:26] what's &>>
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:33:28] or bash -c "help disown" 🙂
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:33:41] &>> is append stdout and stderr
2021-07-18 05:12:20	 *	Psi-Jack [22:33:49] lost access to bash's "help" from using zsh everywhere.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:34:01] Psi-Jack clearly the problem is that you use zsh
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:34:10] heh, yet, I like zsh. 🙂
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:34:18] i knew there was something wrong with you
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:34:22] I do miss the help command though.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Sauvin	[22:34:34] Gots man pages? O:)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:34:43] why do "$1" "${@:2}" &>> ${b_out:-/dev/null} &, not just $@ &>> ${b_out:-/dev/null} &
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:34:49] zsh's manpages for internal functions are one of it's downsides.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:35:27] pyzozord to ensure arguments are passed correctly, i don't remember exactly, it's been probably a couple decades since i wrote that
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:36:37] i think phogg has something very similar and may know the answer
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:36:49] last question, how to prevent process ran like this from outputing to my console?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:36:54] it won't
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:37:17] my script has all output go to ~/.b.out by default
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:37:26] you don't need to disown in that script, anyway. it's not an interactive bash shell and no HUP will be sent upon exiting. not even an interactive login shell will, for that matter.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:37:54] I did simpler version $@ >/dev/null & why does my version still output to the console?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:37:54] pyzozord: you can get the pid with command & pid=$!
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:38:13] curdlesnoot i had to put it in there in the past because when i closed the terminal emulator the apps started did close with it
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:38:46] pyzozord because you're only redirecting stdout and not stderr
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:39:41] oh that's the &> part
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:39:44] in bash you can use &> instead of > to get both
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:40:04] rascul: perfect, thanks
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:40:06] TIL!
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:42:21] rascul: bash -c 'sleep 600 &'. that's a non-interactive shell, obviously. check with pgrep -a sleep afterwards. then close the interactive instance of bash you ran that from and check from another. should still be there. maybe you had huponexit enabled in the past.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:42:36] curdlesnoot maybe i did, i dunno
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:43:07] rascul: i'll hup you
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[22:43:07] pyzozord, it would be better if you spelled out TIL as today I learned from now on
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:43:13] rascul: anyway, let me know if that isn't true in your case.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:43:23] What? TIL is a very common acronym!
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:43:28] NOT SMS speak.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:43:33] here we go ...
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:43:54] 🎶 come with me...
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:44:20] what's SMS speak?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[22:44:38] Psi-Jack, if you;d like to discuss the rules or applications thereof, you would need to do it on #linux-ops
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:44:39] jim: I'll actually consider that
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:44:47] pyzozord: Things like "u", "thx", "ty", "oic", etc.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:44:58] Psi-Jack: don't forget about 'hbu'
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:45:10] I've never even seen 'hbu'. heh
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:45:29] Psi-Jack: i had someone who was 36 send me that... i had to face palm
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:45:33] 'how bout you'
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:45:39] ... Wow...
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:45:59] Yeah, that one's pretty bad. heh
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[22:46:15] Am looking at a solution like TigerVNC, but TigerVNC does not seem to have proper relative mouse coordinates. This breaks almost everything that has an FPS perspective (e.g. many games, simulations, etc.). Is there something equally as fast, preferably open-source, that's not broken in this regard?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:46:38] you're trying to play a game over vnc!?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:46:49] and the mouse is your biggest concern?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:46:49] lol
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:46:55] heh
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[22:49:05] Not primarily looking at gaming, no. But it's an example of a massive breakage... and Tiger is *faster* than anything else I've seen, so it would actually be possible.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	pyzozord	[22:49:05] thanks guys!
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[22:49:15] TomTheDragon: steam client / steam player
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:49:43] well but its a stupid example...
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[22:49:44] rodolfo: will this work for the traditional use case of full desktop access? open source?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:50:59] I can't seem to remember how I reformatted a Seagate drive from 512e to 4kn. google is letting me down (it might have been with openSeaChest, or maybe with sg_format) Can someone remember for me?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:51:36] what is 512e and 4kn?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:52:09] 512 electrons, 4 krabby nuts
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:52:35] rascul, that is what seagate calls them, 512 byte blocks (emulated) and 4k blocks (native)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rascul	[22:52:52] oh
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:53:43] You don't "format" as that, you partition as that.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:53:47] I had one of my 16TB Seagates die after <1year and I finally got a replacement (thanks Chia)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:53:48] you don't have control over how the hard drive is formatted at the low-level.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	oerheks	[22:53:58] " Seagate drive from 512e to 4kn"  1st hit https://www.seagate.com/support/software/seachest/
2021-07-18 05:12:20	 *	[[[R]]] [22:53:59] creates a new partition in Psi-Jack 
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:53:59] Psi-Jack, it really is a 'FastFormat' not a partition
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:54:11] you might have had a switch to enable 512e mode though. or maybe they implement is a firmware setting.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	oerheks	[22:54:28] use that seagate tool
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:54:38] oerheks, I think it was with openSeaChest (the version that will compile for linux)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:54:52] The weird thing is the tools weren't compiled in my source tree
2021-07-18 05:12:20	oerheks	[22:55:12] the download gives a lin64 verion too
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:55:47] Gonna try doing it with ./openSeaChest_FormatUnit
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:56:50] ossifrage: Beyond the partition itself, there's block size in the filesystem itself, which is specific between filesystem formats.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:57:17] Psi-Jack, this has nothing to do with the partition, it is a property of the physical drive
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[22:57:25] Okay, Ignore the help. Good luck.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:57:38] The drive can say "I have 512 byte blocks" or "I have 4096 byte blocks"
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:58:03] yeah. 512e or otherwise exposing the real physical block size.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[22:58:07] Out of the box it says, 512, but I've already switched the other drives in the raid group to 4096, so the new one does as well
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:58:11] if the drive talks, and no one is listening, does it really make a sound?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[[R]]]	[22:58:20] curdlesnoot: naked!?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:58:38] [[[R]]]: blockdev didn't tell me
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[22:59:52] [[R]]: me hearties
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:00:41] TomTheDragon: games, with a hack some apps only. Far from open source.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ossifrage	[23:03:05] ./openSeaChest_FormatUnit --device /dev/sdc --setSectorSize 4096 --confirm this-will-erase-data
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:03:09] rodolfo: yeah, looks like it'd be a bear to setup for anything other than games... looks like it's going to be strapping a bunch of python/gstreamer/pulseaudio/libinput stuff together for me
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:03:56] rodolfo: and, disgustingly, actually writing an Xserver... wow, maybe that's why no solution exists
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:04:30] TomTheDragon: in fact i do not understand your "problem to solve"
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:05:20] Nobody seems to at this point, yet. 🙂
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:05:25] TomTheDragon: you just need to access a windows machine? rdp/ts session?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:05:40] Psi-Jack: lol
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:06:51] It's a trivial issue, need to accsess a remote Linux machine, but need some form of relative mouse support, or "input redirection" (where it's like the actual kb/mouse is connected to the remote X server)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:07:30] That's not a trivial issue.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:08:50] Pretty much any VM software I've seen seems to support this.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[23:09:21] TomTheDragon: https://www.yingtongli.me/blog/2019/11/18/input-over-ssh.html
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:09:22] TomTheDragon: maybe it is not what you looking for, but when i need to use some graphical program between my two linux machines i'm used to export through ssh
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:09:33] curdlesnoot: high five!
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[23:10:33] rodolfo: I think you were talking about X11 forwarding? the above article concerns a different matter.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	hassoon	[23:10:34] high six
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:12:25] Heh, wow... using xinput and xdotool, via python over ssh. Yikes. Sounds unpleasant as heck.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[23:12:37] TomTheDragon: as you can see, the request to implement relative positioning in TigerVNC was fulfilled. the problem may remain with your server, though.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:12:41] curdlesnoot: my fault
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:12:42] Oh, interesting, now that is actually useful! Now I know TigerVNC has some patch supposed to fix game controls but.. limited to that, difficult to compile, and doesn't even seem to fix glitchy mouse.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:13:19] I've actually compiled the server, and the client. The server is a bear to compile... probably because Xorg itself is tough
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:13:40] (From master, yesterday)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:13:42] hassoon: 8(
2021-07-18 05:12:20	curdlesnoot	[23:13:47] x11vnc?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:13:50] So, this IS about games? Wow...
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:14:00] Psi-Jack: kkkkk
2021-07-18 05:12:20	rodolfo	[23:14:18] Psi-Jack: "to a friend of mine"
2021-07-18 05:12:20	akik	[23:19:07] TomTheDragon: check out xpra too
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:19:42] Hmmmm... xpra, maybe x2go. Never used xpra to date yet.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:19:48] Actually, I might've, and hated it.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	akik	[23:20:00] sure thing
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ThiefMaster	[23:20:15] hi, what could cause this error? "modprobe: FATAL: Module cdc-acm not found in directory /lib/modules/5.10.27-gentoo"? the module exists in /lib/modules/5.10.27-gentoo/kernel/drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.ko and `insmod` with that path works fine
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:20:28] yeaaah, I remember xpra now. And yes, I absolutely personally disliked it.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	akik	[23:20:49] TomTheDragon: there's also linuxserver.io webtop that looked promising
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[R]]	[23:20:59] ThiefMaster: try running depmod -a
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ThiefMaster	[23:21:26] ty, that fixed it. i wonder why it wasn't needed in the past..
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[R]]	[23:21:37] because if you properly do things
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[R]]	[23:21:40] it works correctly
2021-07-18 05:12:20	amanr	[23:22:34] hey! I've been using i3wm for sometime now, but there's a bug where my pulseaudio server doesn't get startup on logging in for the first time, but if I refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) i3wm multiple times it does.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	amanr	[23:22:43] I don't really understand the reason
2021-07-18 05:12:20	amanr	[23:23:22] The line executing the same is: `exec_always --no-startup-id pkill pulseaudio; pulseaudio -vvv   `
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:25:09] Psi-Jack: it's not primarily games, one major use case is viewing (in first person view, with blender) 3d house model I'm working on. Just figured games were a more common activity.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:26:52] Psi-Jack: I've used xpra and... it seems intermittenly ok and broken. Also, sluggish.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	akoana	[23:26:57] amanr: maybe try  exec_always --no-startup-id "pkill pulseaudio; pulseaudio -vvv"
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:27:16] Sometimes it'll lose touch with the Xvnc-for-Xpra and have to track it down and kill it
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:27:20] TomTheDragon: Yeah, I just don't like how it works, compared to x2go.

2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:30:24] [[R]]: I was genuinely curious
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[R]]	[23:30:28] about what
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:30:39] about how you guys backup your media
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[23:30:39] onelegend, why specify that? do you really trust that kind of situation?

2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:31:22] Psi-Jack: I will actually look into that, thanks for sharing that
2021-07-18 05:12:20	akik	[23:31:24] "Raspberry Pi colocation is only $8 per month!"
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:31:38] Psi-Jack: x2go is awesome... at least in terms of ease of use. but it is horrendously slow for something like 3d editing and... even a wordprocessor or spreadsheet is kind of a grind.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[23:31:50] some folks like borg backup, it's all CLI based
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:31:50] akik: good deals
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:32:00] Hmmm, I found it fast as heck for those, except never did 3D stuff with it.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:32:07] jim: that's what I want to use, except, I need somewhere to host the backup server
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:32:26] can't put it in my house or that'll defeat the purpose
2021-07-18 05:12:20	akik	[23:32:27] don't try 3d stuff with x2go. you'll lose your mind
2021-07-18 05:12:20	amanr	[23:32:42] One other thing I notice with i3-gaps, whenever I refresh (Mod+Shift+R) it switches from having gaps to not, and so on.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:32:49] jim: what did you mean by trust
2021-07-18 05:12:20	TomTheDragon	[23:33:03] for 3d you really have to have a remote framebuffer (VNC, etc)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[23:33:14] onelegend, so you don't trust something about what's in your house?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:33:41] jim: no I need to have a copy of my data in the case that something happens to my house
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:33:45] offsite backups
2021-07-18 05:12:20	hodapp	[23:33:53] back in 2012 there was a data center in Austria (I think) that would host a Pi for free if you shipped it to them
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[23:34:19] maybe you should have copies in your house and offsite
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:34:26] yeah that's what I'm doing
2021-07-18 05:12:20	jim	[23:35:08] sounds pretty good...
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:35:17] cool
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:35:20] yeah, I've got a process of backups for my Synology NAS and CephFS storage cluster that basically copies all my backups to b2 automatically. 🙂
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[R]]	[23:35:37] Psi-Jack: but then what happens if b2 crashes?

2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[R]]	[23:36:37] you need a real secondary backup
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Psi-Jack	[23:36:42] Sorry, I spend about $10/mo for b2 for roughly around 2TB.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	onelegend	[23:37:29] where do you keep your secondary backups rbox
2021-07-18 05:12:20	[[R]]	[23:37:40] onelegend: i don't even have a primary backup

2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:16:46] So 4MB per root filesystem?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Sauvin	[07:17:02] I would establish different directories for /home for different directories in a multiboot situation. Distros tend to run different versions of different things and config files may get confused.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:17:10] linking the well known XDG users dirs (Downloads, Documents etc) should be fine. less so, in the case of dotfiles.

2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[07:18:07] After a long exploration and testing various distros
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:18:32] Rashad, no problem if you have 5 minutes, you can edit the files with the commands I posted or use vi.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:18:35] autopsy: ok so "printf "%s\n" "http_caching=packages" >> /etc/yum.conf" will work for 1 and I think also for 2, except that 2 won't be created yet
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:18:47] So I think I should do "touch <file>" first?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[07:19:05] Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Kali and Arch
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:19:08] Rashad, it wants enabled=0 after [main] so no cause [main] might not be last in operation 2.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:19:10] autopsy This is for some kind of initialization script
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:19:23] I already did them manually with vi, but now I want it automated
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:19:26] Yeah HTTP caching good idea.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:19:35] Rashad, yep.

2021-07-18 16:36:24	jim	[07:20:59] Daemonick, this is advice I gave about 10 years ago, and it's just as valid today: explore what's in common to all dists, you'll find a -lot- there that's worth study
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:21:14] Rashad, automation is part of systems administration.

2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:21:16] I think it's because my user name is foo instead of "foo@posteo.de"
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:21:32] Rashad: hey, ltns
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:22:20] Don't forget about systemctl enable rc-local.service too. Hehe. YEAH
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:22:22] more good news, it seems my isp has email =)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:22:36] Every ISP has Email.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:22:52] Well they sure don't advertise it
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:23:00] Not that yours won't after I stated that but...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:24:38] jim: i'm reluctant to try gentoo/etc. because building the sources wastes a lot of time
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kyv	[07:25:31] It doesnt waste as much time as downloading a bunch of distros with little distinction from each other just to test what software it comes packaged with.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:25:34] rindolf hi o/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:25:43] Rashad: no, concerning touch. besides, if you write http_caching=packages to a brand new file, that's presumably an invalid because it is not preceded by a "[main]" section heading?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:25:49] an invalid config, that is.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:26:13] autopsy: when you mentioned: sed -i -e 's|[main]|[main]\nenabled=0|' fastestmirror.py , why is the file .py? is this part of the command or is it just a typo?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:26:19] rindolf: gentoo offers a kernel now
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:26:27] because the file originally has no extention @ autopsy
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:26:39] or actually it is .conf
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:26:50] Rashad, I typed out .py thinking it was a Python file, its just a plain file then?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:27:02] yeah, .conf
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:27:18] Rashad, much of DNF and Yum are Python files (modules) and they are named .py my mistake.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:27:36] I'm going to try this with a ssh session now to make sure they work, then add them to the initialization script
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:27:51] autopsy No worries, just making sure
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:27:54] Ok. Let us know what fails.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rapiz1	[07:28:24] i'm interested in kvm and wondering how it works. where can i start from? like a book?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:28:39] There might be a book on KVM.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:28:55] Why don't you look up RedHat KVM documentation it is really precise.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:29:01] Comes with tweaks too.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[07:29:58] do you want to know how to use it, or do you want to know how it's implemented?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rapiz1	[07:30:15] sheep, how it's implemented
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:30:19] sheep you need a baaaaaa aaaa th.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:30:20] Rashad: how are you?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rapiz1	[07:30:21] autospy, i'm looking into it
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kyv	[07:30:41] thats a tuffy
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:30:56] RedHat documentation is by far the best you can get close to cisco shit.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:31:50] Rashad: that's pretty broken. consider the results of: printf '%s\n' '[main]' 'barn=1' | sed -e 's|[main]|[main]\nenabled=0|'
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:31:51] woooooot
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:31:51] rindolf: good hbu?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:32:00] I made it, I can work with mailx
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:32:09] Izem: i also need xfce and x11 and ff and dolphin and gwenview
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[07:32:15] the Documentation/virt/kvm directory in the linux sources has a lot of documentation
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:32:28] curdlesnoot, whats broken?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:32:31] rindolf: good point
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:32:47] autopsy: see for yourself
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:32:51] Rashad: been blogging on twitter and gh
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:33:03] curdlesnoot, I looked and it was nothing.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:33:08] Nothing should error.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:33:13] autopsy: the output of that command is nothing?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:33:21] Oh no, your command?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	autopsy [07:33:30] looks away and back again
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:33:35] autopsy: it's your command combined with input demonstrating it is thoroughly broken.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[07:33:55] some of the stuff on https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Documents might also be useful
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:33:56] Izem++ # admitting i was righter
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:33:57] curdlesnoot, you're trying to add shit that aint there.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:33:58] or rather, your sed expression.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:34:03] No.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:34:14] autopsy: you're trying to deflect from the mistake in the sed expression.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:34:17] next I have to try esmtp tommorow :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:34:26] autopsy: what do you think [main] means in a regular expression?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:34:28] autopsy: `sed -i -e 's|[main]|[main]\nenabled=0|' /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/fastestmirror.conf` is not exactly working
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	curdlesnoot [07:34:34] sighs
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:34:39] Ok.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:34:43] autopsy Is there a way to use sed to replace the entire file?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:34:54] and cool, posteo uses dovecot
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:34:57] Rashad, yes.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:35:06] Izem: "it's a good day to die"
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:35:09] autopsy Actually, since the file won't be there in the first place, I will be just adding to the end
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:35:14] autopsy: some people would actually be interested in learning more. disappointing response.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rapiz1	[07:35:15] sheep, kernel documentation is a good place for information. but it's hard to read and may not be suitable for me. i want to know about the idea and design behind kvm
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:35:20] Rashad, 's|This is the target|This is the replacator|'
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:35:31] Create it first with `touch` then add the text to the end
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[07:35:34] rapiz1: https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Documents looks like it has some good things
2021-07-18 16:36:24	geirha	[07:35:39] don't use sed, just copy a complete file
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:35:40] rapiz1: might be a linux conf video
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:35:50] curdlesnoot, if you can help without being all side-walking and things go for it.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:36:07] but iirc it's just a vm in the kernel
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:36:17] autopsy: Oh I think I can just echo!
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kyv	[07:36:19] rapiz1: surely the brunt of human knowledge available at your fingertips can provide some information.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:36:27] Rashad, yeah echo would work too.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:36:33] rindolf: obscure pop culture reference?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:36:42] Alpha bravo Charlie Delta Echo
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:37:09] DON MEGA DON MEG...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:37:12] Rashad: i realised i may have made some female and male great hackers cry
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	autopsy [07:37:13] ok wait
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:37:29] Who is DON?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	autopsy [07:37:46] asks the floor
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rapiz1	[07:38:31] Kyv, so have you checkout virt/kvm ? mostly apis and params. you can learn from that if you're already familiar with kvm and want to take advantage of that. but not that useful if you want to know how it works
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:38:41] ok now I am trying `sudo echo '[main]\nenabled=0' >> /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/fastestmirror.conf` and it says "Permission denied"
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:38:42] -.-
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:38:51] I'm not sudo enough for you linux?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[07:39:00] >> doesn't run in sudo
2021-07-18 16:36:24	geirha	[07:39:03] >> file  is done before sudo is started
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:39:07] Izem: i mean it figuratively - a good day to admit you had been wrong
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:39:08] Rashad, sudo and redirects take place at different times.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:39:16] Rashad, just: su - root
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:39:25] Rashad, then echo yourself to the file.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[07:39:27] actually you don't need su -
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Izem	[07:39:41] rindolf: I see, no shame in doing that :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:39:48] Ok whats he going to use?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	geirha	[07:39:49] printf '[main]\nenabled=0\n' | sudo tee -a thefile  # still a bad idea
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[07:39:51] echo '[main]\nenabled=0' | sudo tee -a /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/fastestmirror.conf
2021-07-18 16:36:24	curdlesnoot	[07:39:51] autopsy: I am helping. I'm asking you to reckon with the matter of what a square-bracketed sequences means in a regular expression. once that's understood, the nature of the mistake will be understood, and then your future expressions might be more likely to represent your intent.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:40:20] curdlesnoot, ok well, I should have escaped the brackets then.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:40:21] ok now instead of having a new line I get a literal \n
2021-07-18 16:36:24	geirha	[07:40:22] depending on what shell you run that echo command in, the \n may or may not be replaced with a newline
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:40:28] maybe there is an option in echo...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	geirha	[07:40:49] one of the reasons why using echo is not recommended. Use printf instead
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:41:16] Rashad, this: sed -i -e 's|\[main\]|\[main\]\nenabled=0|' fastestmirror.conf
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:41:29] Rashad, man echo
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:41:39] Actually its a builtin, so man builtins
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[07:42:12] ok used printf instead of echo and it worked
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:42:23] Ok good.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:42:41] Closing 1300 Firefox tabs feels so relieving
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:43:08] acidsys, like gimme another processor .... maaaaaan.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	akik	[07:43:10] acidsys: it's not a competition
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:43:17] Memory usage went down from ~55GB to 20. Not bad.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:43:31] I had to share somewhere
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:43:35] It's a big step for me
2021-07-18 16:36:24	geirha	[07:43:41] the proper solution, regardless, is to create a full config file and copy that out. Editing config files non-interactively with sed or similar tools is error-prone, and you won't get any response from sed if it fails
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:44:00] autopsy: You can have mine <3
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:44:13] YES!
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	autopsy [07:44:32] gets all square bracketed up and falls out of rackets.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:44:48] :0
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	acidsys [07:45:11] steals square brackets from toml and offers support
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:45:54] Can I formulate another benzyl ring out of 2-methyl-propanol and isopropylbenzylamine?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:46:21] That's a bit above my head but if it kicks in then I might say yes
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:47:03] It might kick a benzyl ring up.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:47:10] 4 and 3 is 7.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:49:54] I need a bash script to simulate the formulation, is there any good scientific chemistry software I can use?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:50:15] I like Stellarium... so...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:52:00] for $chemist in $(curl http://chem1stsaaw5rasr34v.onion); do make $chemist; done
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[07:52:03] something like that
2021-07-18 16:36:24	geirha	[07:53:54] for chemist in   variable names do not start with $
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:54:13] <Izem> rindolf: I see, no shame in doing that :) ==> on the contrary, my friend! (IMO)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:54:42] Yeah. I should do that exactly.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:55:26] How do you formulate a benzene ring though how do you exhibit the change readily by heating 7 ch3 molecule groups?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[07:55:34] acidsys: wow, 1300 ff tabs
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[07:58:34] Is this right?

2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[07:59:59] it should be 176 F
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[08:00:02] We touchin all kinds of class topics today don't let me spook ya!
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pasiz	[08:00:12] 100F is 37C
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[08:00:18] Ok.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pasiz	[08:00:55] fahrenheit is defined by 100 degrees is body temperature (and body temperature is 37 in celsius)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[08:00:56] Eww. My math is screwed in this script. Bash arithmentic is easy but not this.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[08:01:58] rindolf: thanks thanks
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[08:02:54] What am I doing wrong? https://paste.centos.org/view/536feb8d
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[08:03:23] you're adding 32 firsat
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[08:03:29] you should do that last
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[08:03:46] Oh ok... I'll do that last then.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	sheep	[08:03:54] actually I think the whole thing is in backwards
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[08:04:19] sheep, the whole thing in backwards oh noes!

2021-07-18 16:36:24	TheWild	[08:12:36] I suppose you've heard of IPFS, right?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Sauvin	[08:12:49] units 'tempF(80)' 'tempC'
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Sauvin	[08:13:00] 	26.666667
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Sauvin	[08:13:38] One bad thing about Linux is that it's so full of tools that it's very easy to go inventing something without realising what you want may already be there.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	TheWild	[08:14:21] it's full of half-baked tools
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Sauvin	[08:14:36] What makes you say they're "half-baked"?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	clemens3	[08:14:36] redundency like in nature
2021-07-18 16:36:24	TheWild	[08:15:25] okay, I'm sorry. Actually, the Python language seems complete and bunch of other applications too, but often it's easier and faster to reinvent a wheel than to learn a wheel made by someone else, especially when there's no documentation.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:16:37] someone gimme a terminal-based audio volume meter
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Sauvin	[08:16:45] It's sometimes easier just to WRITE something that it is to FIND it!
2021-07-18 16:36:24	asanto	[08:17:43] Hi all, can not find out why mailx sends mail to dead.letter, /var/log/maillog is empty, and there are no log files like *mail* in /var/log. How to find out why mailx can't sent letter ?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[08:18:03] Maybe you are sending through an installed MTA, i.e. Postfix
2021-07-18 16:36:24	acidsys	[08:18:11] Then the log ends up there
2021-07-18 16:36:24	longxia	[08:20:42] Asanto: does the -v option tell you more?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	asanto	[08:21:06] acidsys, mailx is configured to sent mail via third party smtp server, and it sends successfully if sending is triggered by hand from command line, but cron, which is configured to send letters with mailx sends letters to dead.letter
2021-07-18 16:36:24	TheWild	[08:21:07] for the half-baked tools: gpg won't let you provide a raw AES key, ssh won't let you read a password from parameter or environment variable (you need sshpass for it - technically a hack), socat supports SOCKS4 but not SOCKS5, Firefox won't let you install your own addons (unless it's a dev version), gedit lets you enter emoji from the context menu (sadly not all Unicode characters)...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	TheWild	[08:21:16] there were more but I don't remember at the moment
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:27:33] Asanto: pastebin your script and somebody will likely find the mistake, typically missing paths or so
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:27:58] cron has a much less of a default environment (PATH, HOME etc.) than your normal user
2021-07-18 16:36:24	autopsy	[08:28:08] Sauvin, I got disconnected just as you were beginning to tell me.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:28:26] Sauvin, i had a python one that stopped working
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:28:35] how can I switch desktops from terminal?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:28:55] I'm vnc'ed to my system but it's behaving like "View Only" mode (mouse events not going through)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:29:12] from ssh to one of my x11 terminal sessions I can issue commands, of course, ..
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:29:14] kde
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:29:22] chvt
2021-07-18 16:36:24	asanto	[08:29:59] longxia, I sent mail from cron with option CRONDARGS="-m /usr/local/sbin/mailx-t"
2021-07-18 16:36:24	asanto	[08:29:59]  where mailx-t is #!/bin/sh
2021-07-18 16:36:24	asanto	[08:29:59] \n exec mailx -t, if i add option -v, where can I find output of this cascade: crond -> #!/bin/sh
2021-07-18 16:36:24	asanto	[08:29:59] exec mailx -t -> exec mailx -t -v ?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:30:48] DLange, no the X11 kde virtual desktop
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:31:37] qdbus org.kde.KWin /KWin setCurrentDesktop 2
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:31:49] or 3 or 4
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:31:57] thanks
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:31:59] :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	TheWild	[08:33:51] what the heck "410 Gone" means in the context of IPFS?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:33:54] DLange, oh, cute. I already had some shell scripts I put it all in.. "kde-desktop-next" -prev and -set
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jaggz	[08:34:07] forgot them
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:34:11] happens
2021-07-18 16:36:24	asanto	[08:34:27] here is my configs: https://pastebin.com/qASZk39y
2021-07-18 16:36:24	bob_x1	[08:35:41] is torsocks compatible with mcabber chat ? It seems mcabber do not get my local torsocks proxy and cannot connect trhough it
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:36:00] wtf is torsocks?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:36:16] mcabber wtf is THAT?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:36:38] What the fluenza is that I mean?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	biopsy [08:37:01] excuses bob_x1 as though he sneezed
2021-07-18 16:36:24	AlexDelarge	[08:37:05] it lets you use tor thru socks, hence tor-socks
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:37:15] tornup socks?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	longxia	[08:37:27] Asanto: I'm not sure how to get at the -v output in this case. Your original question didn't mention cron so I thought it would be easy to add the -v.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:37:31] dragging dem feet I'll tell ya.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:38:47] I'm no good at new technologies especially when its all related to based down to, boiled down to 4chan, tor, and onion.onion
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:39:06] Asanto: read the "Sending mail from scripts" section of man mailx. Also note, as you configure it, this is a function to send error output only via cron.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:39:14] I could go for some boiled onion though.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	AlexDelarge	[08:39:26] the fk are you on about
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:39:32] That would make a good soup stock with a bit of celery and cilantro.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:39:48] I make good food when I'm hungry.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kyv	[08:40:01] biopsy: you may be onto something revolutionary there
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:40:26] Kyv, yeah ya think?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	bob_x1	[08:40:42] biopsy: it seems that mcabber uses lmproxy
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:40:54] Ok.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:41:59] What is C6H5(CH2)HNOH(CH2)C6H5?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:42:10] Chemistry
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[08:42:18] Some hydrocarbon compound
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:42:30] Yeah but what is the compund named in the scheme of chemistry naming?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	bob_x1	[08:42:35] is it linux machine case ? biopsy
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:43:10] biopsy: what does that have to do with Linux?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:44:03] Well. I might be using a bash script to simulate the molecular linking since O is 2 6 and N is 2 5
2021-07-18 16:36:24	AlexDelarge	[08:44:39] lol
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[08:44:45] There are a few molecular editor, even Kalzium used to have one
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:44:52] Kalzium?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[08:45:07] A program from kdekids, I think
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[08:45:15] viewmol might also be able to do it
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:45:16] Yeah I asked earlier if there was any good chemistry software ????? But nobody said anything.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	AlexDelarge	[08:45:26] i wonder why
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[08:45:31] biopsy: why not use python3 / etc instead?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:46:08] rindolf, ehh. Am I right in saying Python is hard to learn from documentation?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[08:46:29] biopsy: not at all
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:46:35] I know Yum and Anaconda but thats about all the python I know.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	AlexDelarge	[08:46:40] ##programming
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:46:54] Kalzium then.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:47:04] hexnewbie, where do I get Kalzium?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[08:47:19] biopsy: https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ_with_ToC__generated.md#i-want-to-learn-programming-which-language-should-i-start-with
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[08:47:23] The molecular editor is grayed out for me in Kalzium, no idea why, may be another buster downgrade. But it used to be available
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[08:47:43] I remember using it, though I did install viewmol for a similar reason, maybe?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:47:57] Ok I got Kalzium in dnf search cool.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	AlexDelarge	[08:48:01] biopsy must be somehow related to beaky from ##programming
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[08:49:01] AlexDelarge: oh, beaky is a weird troll
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	rindolf [08:50:06] suspects beaky is devils' works
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:52:27] The computer industry has made billions of dollars and they keep making more money.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:52:50] Whats it down to now 9 nm silicon?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:53:06] 15 nm?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[08:53:18] biopsy: lots of NPOs do too
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[08:53:42] Well in my previous plan to have many distros in a SSD and seperate partitions in HDD...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[08:53:57] Can be solved to have common kernel?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[08:54:05] I want to free up space
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[08:54:57] biopsy: time/love >>> money: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3WJiqc_bEs
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:55:18] Daemonick, yeah.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:55:36] Daemonick, you can save space that way.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:55:55] Daemonick, compile one though yourself and install it, then use that.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[08:56:33] Is there any but? biopsy?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:56:57] Daemonick, packaged kernels for each packaging distribution yeah.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[08:57:03] They must be synchronized globally?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[08:57:34] Well.. no but you can't have one calling initramfs /init and one callinbg systemd
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[08:58:24] Thanx biberu
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Daemonick	[08:58:30] Thanx biopsy
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:58:35] Daemonick: kernels are relatively small over the distribution userland, so you save not much using a common kernel
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:59:01] and you take away the ability to use functions that the distro needs from a kernel over other distros
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[08:59:19] think SELinux in the Red Hat distros
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:01:06] Kernel can be big if you compile all modules, but don't strip, but yeah, the distro kernels would be relatively small. 283 MB modules here (stripped). Unfortunately all solutions intended for this (e.g. dedup) work worse than advertised, you're better off buying larger storage
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Sauvin	[09:01:37] Funny... my kernel doesn't get any smaller when I strip.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:01:55] you shall strip the kernel
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:02:00] not strip yourself :-)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:02:46] Not the kernel, the modules, make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=~/kernelbld/root INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:02:58] Daemonick, hexnewbie, check out DRBL and DRBD
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:03:19] diogenese: drbd does the opposite of dedup
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:03:38] Apollo Thank you
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:03:52] Er, biopsy ^^ apologies
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:03:53] Genesis just got done.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:05:05] OK is there a way to make yum not care that "Metadata file does not match checksum"?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:05:22] when trying `yum upgrade`
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:05:41] I tried the following so far: `yum upgrade -nogpgcheck`
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:05:53] disabling the fastestmirror plugin
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:05:54] Rashad: It should always care. It's a big red flag, you need to fix your mirror and/or connection with one that's not been corrupted and/or compromised
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:06:24] hexnewbie The thing is that the proxy in my organization, or perhaps Kaspersky, is screwing with the whole thing
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:06:44] I think Kaspersky overrides some certificates on my machine or something like that
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:06:49] Still, if the data is coming out corrupted, you cannot trust the data.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:07:36] hexnewbie Yes, but this is a one time thing, and there is nothing I can do except to disable Kaspersky
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:07:50] The problem is not in the data it is in our network/security
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:08:10] I could call someone to disable Kaspersky for 15/30 minutes but that seems even more scary
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:08:46] I am not installing some obscure package, just upgrading a fresh install
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:09:16] Even worse
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:09:56] Rashad: yum clean all   and download again, if the proxy breaks the files, download them elsewhere, pack in a zip and put them in the cachedir
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:10:11] It's not like someone will know that at this exact moment I am going to disable to checksum and then target me specifically with a man-in-the-middle attack
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:10:41] well, you are already targeted by somebody breaking your network integrity
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:10:41] DLange I tried `yum clean all`
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:10:48] offline installation is not ideal for me
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:11:04] DLange You mean our networking guys?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:11:16] Yeah, it's more like someone is targetting with a MITM attack, and will mistakenly think it's a proxy and disable the checksum check to resolve. (Most would count proxy-related corruption to be that already)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:11:40] they and/or anybody else. Once you can't trust the network integrity, you can't know how many actors are playing with your bytes.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:14:14] I think it is just bad configuration of Kaspersky/the network
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:14:27] The only way a proxy seems to be able affect this is if the proxy has cached two versions of the two files that aren't matched. May also be a badly synced mirror, too. There should be way to request current versions of the files nonetheless
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:14:44] I am trying to find the relevant stackoverflow post that discussed this
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:15:13] The top answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45556189/git-the-revocation-function-was-unable-to-check-revocation-for-the-certificate
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:15:14] just wget the files from somewhere else
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:15:29] your proxy will give you the broken file until it thinks it is expired
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[09:17:52] Rashad: how have you been?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	rindolf	[09:19:49] Rashad: may i pm you?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:23:47] rindolf sure
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:24:38] DLange by "somewhere" you mean somewhere other than the machine I am already trying "yum upgrade" on?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:25:08] Rashad: by somewhere I mean from a mirror your proxy has not corrupted
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:25:45] of course if you are running a VM inside Windows and your Kapersky breaks that, it won't help you
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:26:00] but I am guessing, you did not tell us what you are actually doing yet :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:28:12] Using https mirrors may also help. Doesn't proxying https require CONNECT, i.e. move the proxy out of the way? By the sound of it, this one appears to be a transparent one, so if you have a company-wide CA for its https counterpart, that may not be true.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:30:00] DLange I am trying to use this: https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-projects/tree/main/OracleDatabase/19.3.0
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:30:40] I think I will contact the Kaspersky people so they might be able to whitelist some things or something
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:31:17] Curiously enough, if I run "yum upgrade" 4 or 5 times or more, the errors disappear
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:31:41] not curious, it selects a different mirror
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DLange	[09:31:51] which is not broken in caching (yet)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:32:23] Well at first it says "trying another mirror..." multiple times then says "no more mirrors left to try"
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:32:40] Rashad, thats still using fastestmirror
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:33:19] I did disable it though
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:33:26] Rashad, in your yum.conf in /etc/yum/ you have url=http://mirriorlist?releasever=34etc etc
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:33:39] Not fully synced mirrors break without caching occasionally, we can't 100% sure of the diagnosis (but yeah, a transparent MITM proxy would be my first suspect too)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:34:00] Rashad, by default the yum configuration uses all mirrors available, so nobody's mirror goes left untouched by users downloading packages and yum metadata.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:34:17] Rashad, what do you need to use a proxy URL?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:34:42] Rashad, just change url=to ftp:// nfs:// ssh:// vnc:// or whatever you want.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:35:28] hexnewbie, nah you're going too deep for what is happenning here.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:36:36] I mean, no, it happens occasionally to everybody. I've got to switch my mirror once every two years temporarily to get the correct packages
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:36:56] The baseurl or url directive decides what to use from there. this exapnds to a mirrorlist in the mirrorlist so put your proxy URL in baseurl=http://myproxy:8080/this/yum/repo
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:37:23] And if I still using testing and/or sid, it'd be happening once a few months (security.debian.org not seems affected by this often or at all)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:37:41] OK actually this big comment exists in my yum.conf file: https://justpaste.it/2do3a
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:37:53] "# metadata_expire=90m"
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:38:07] hexnewbie, I didn't read that yeah corrupt packages by insane amounts of retransmissions on a wireless link for example on a channel that is saturated will cause yum metadata to come throiiugh until it is not corrupt and those are summed.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:38:34] This simply means it will install an old version instead of a newer version... no?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:38:56] Rashad, yeah thats how long before the yum metadata it gets from the toplevel SRPMS/repo/comps.xml etc .gz .bz2 .xz files are downloaded again to recheck for new packages.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:39:06] Rashad, seriously put it for 1w
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:39:51] Rashad, well, no you also have newer packages which may not be in the metadata list al all.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:39:52] Or zero at the moment, to verify if it is the problem, and/or clear the cache as DLange suggested
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:40:07] yum clean metadata
2021-07-18 16:36:24	hexnewbie	[09:40:16] Of course, if the proxy also caches, that won't be of much help
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:40:24] I always run `yum clean all` before at least the first `yum upgrade`
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Rashad	[09:40:47] and also `yum clean metadata`, but after `clean all` it always finds 0 things to clean
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:40:56] Rashad, thats smooth for RHEL but for Fedora its not neccessary.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:41:41] When dnf finds old metadata it will redownload new metadata.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:42:19] Rashad, look into createrepo.py createrepo_c Anaconda and dnf/yum.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:42:27] Rashad, rpmbuild too.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:42:52] Basically RPMs are a CPIO archive with binary header and a CPIO archive payload.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	biopsy	[09:43:05] But RPM supports all sorts of shit I mean seriously.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:44:37] I made my own repo and had kernel module packages that were outr of tree compiled into RPM packages, and installed to LiveDVD LiveUSB configs that spun up a DVD ISO 9660 image and you would boot from it with the new module package and maybe nothing maybe modprobe and thats IT.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:44:53] Its good for kernel regression testing amonsgts all software is.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:45:54] Live shit is the go to for testing hardware.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:47:09] This is my website: http://www.liveprojects.info/
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[09:48:05] biopsy: 403 forbidden
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:48:14] All the kernel module packages that I had out of tree in staging and what not are all in tree now.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:48:38] rindolf, yes did you want me to host something for you?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:50:21] How much wattage does an i5 4 core processor use at MAX?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:50:38] 110 watts?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[09:51:02] biopsy: i wanted to see something in the link like in https://chucknorris.com/ (♥!)
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[09:51:31] inb4 chuck is a republican...
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:53:10] rindolf, I can host some custom kernel you have or kernel module or package or spin?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[09:53:18] I'd like to know what shaq is doing in all of these commercials.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[09:53:58] the little harlot is everywhere.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:54:20] rindolf, I was providing slimmed down Fedora with just bash and yum on them. Barebones Fluxbox and not much else.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[09:54:28] biopsy: no need - i have shared hosting at hostgator.com
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:54:38] 485 MB RAM usage in Fluxbox 235 MB ISO.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[09:54:48] biopsy: no need - i rent* shared hosting at hostgator.com
2021-07-18 16:36:25	gebbione	[09:55:19] yo folks, is there a way to check if an ssh key is able to connect/auth to a server?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:55:32] Nobody EVER seen Fedora on 235MB ISO before.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[09:55:49] hah
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:55:58] gebbione, use gpg-auth?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[09:56:16] biopsy: 300 MB is peanuts for me
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:56:31] rindolf, yeah thats righttttt.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:56:54] You know who we be.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:57:28] Red to the Blue to the what the peanut.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	gebbione	[09:57:51] biopsy, i have no clue that could be done
2021-07-18 16:36:25	gebbione	[09:58:10] googling but if you have something to suggest do share
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[09:59:18] biopsy: do note https://www.wired.com/2016/04/average-webpage-now-size-original-doom/ though
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[09:59:25] No I need to know how much wattage an i5 4 core processor will utilize at 100% CPU time.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[10:00:57] rindolf, http://vhhgfamilyhistory.org
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:01:22] biopsy: many web workers don't care enough about craftmanship
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:02:24] rindolf: https://davenold.net/category/chickenshit-minimalism/
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:02:37] biopsy: what about that page?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:04:17] Kyv: ah
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:04:22] related: https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:05:27] idlewords is  the worst blog on the web
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[10:05:28] rindolf, thats a replacement for my lost forum (SMF) that the hosting company pushed us to upgrade PHP and MySQL we were using, so now its not something we pay for. Thats my wordpress (And Venus Beaty's) wordpress forum informational website for ancestry in Valley Head where she was born.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[10:07:10] This is my grandpa: http://vhhgfamilyhistory.org/chopper-down-beaty-and-crew-walk-away/ He was a helicopter pilot he flew Hueys.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:07:14] biopsy: i see. «When wishing to comment on a WordPress blog, Summer Glau finds a new zero-day WordPress SQL injection exploit, and uses it to insert the comment into the database directly, because even she cannot rely on its comment box to work.»
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:07:30] rindolf: I sense envy.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:07:44] Kyv: why?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[10:08:02] Kyv, I sense you guys are all in the wrong channel here.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	biopsy	[10:08:17] Like a flock of lost birds.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:08:55] biopsy: we got offtopic - sorry
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:09:04] rindolf: if you feel the need to attack something, attack the points in the article.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	paulcarroty	[10:09:40] wp is garbage in security aspect, it's well known
2021-07-18 16:36:25	paulcarroty	[10:09:58] maybe for decade or two
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:10:03] I'm not afraid.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:10:09] autopsy: Nope, its the right channel.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:10:16] I wasn't afraid when SMF had an update either.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	hexnewbie	[10:11:57] The security problems of WordPress arise from people not updating (especially their plugins and themes), and using dangerously insecure plugins and themes, and using warez plugins and themes which have no updates for them at all, and are from the last century. The security of WP itself is not wonderful, but it's a tough competition there
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:13:05] Kyv: i was attacking the site itself. that post suffers from its general flaws of being 'TL;DR'y
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:13:19] WP has been solid since we started using it after the SMF mysqldump of the data base and the install.php failed to jive under the new MySQL version 5.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:13:40] Kyv: i was attacking the site itself. that post *also* suffers from its general flaws of being 'TL;DR'y
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:14:10] My grandpa was a veteran son.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:14:24] He went in, and took the wounded OUT.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:14:35] Vietnam cmon.. what?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:16:31] Crush your skeleton to fuc*ing gelatin.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:17:13] rindolf: it sounds like  you're a bit sore cause they laugh at Maciej Ceglowski's jokes at Maciej Ceglowski's keynotes.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:19:44] This is me: http://vhhgfamilyhistory.org/wp-content/gallery/hartline-family-photos/Jasper1986.jpg
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:20:47] Kyv: dont know who Maciej is. OTOH, a physiotherapist my sister brought in did not know who Emma Watson is...
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:22:01] Don't play me too close cause I'm no comedian.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:22:29] ( Hint: she is the actress who played https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger )
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:23:25] autopsy: cute photo
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:23:34] rindolf: he had done the 'website obesity crisis' talk linked below, which was the part that was relevant here.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	 *	autopsy [10:23:47] been doing this shit since diapers
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:23:56] I dont know or care about a blog
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:26:08] I also will probably never see it again
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:26:48] I keep opening stuff in Firefox what is it gtk-open that handles URLS?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:27:08] I want it to open in Seamonkey Seamonkey is way faster than firefox.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:27:12] Kyv: i've written this FAQ entry which i feel is much shorter and more informative: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/site_loads_quickly.xhtml
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:28:19] rindolf, very informative I see.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:29:09] rindolf, can you boot a 10 node thin client cluster and configure one over messenger with a guy 900 miles away? Using TFTPd a PXE kernel and what loads fast oh yes 10 NFS root filesystems.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:29:32] Haha.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:29:41] I see you cat gator your tongue.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:29:48] alligator potatoe!
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:29:56] Whattuppo rindolf?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:30:19] Learning I take it.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:30:27] Nope...
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:30:33] Hippopatamus!
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:31:12] wallowed in the mud and chewed his spicy hippo plankton food
2021-07-18 16:36:25	rindolf	[10:31:16] autopsy: thanks for the compliment, and i know nothing about pxe... ask an expert
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:31:28] I'll ask the channel.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:31:39] Does anybody know what PXE even is?
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:32:46] We set up an district managers station with 4 monitors when they had two headed video cards, two in the box 4 on top, and he called it GOLIATH.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:33:16] I could find the pictures if you want to see them.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:33:39] Thats when Xorg needed DeviceID and BusIds specified for every viewport there... yeah that was easy!
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:34:50] We were playing rubix cube with the positioning of the VGA cables into the heads and the two cards in thier slots, that was cool as rice.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:35:22] autopsy: has the liquor store clerk seen your baby pictures?

2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:38:17] PXE is Pre eXEcution environment.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:38:56] It is where the server boots from the network interface by downloading over TFTPd a small kernel image that is uncompressed and executed from RAM only... no disk here.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	Kyv	[10:39:14] preboot
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:39:27] Then you set up the root filesystem and switch_root or pivot_root whichever you prefer. And finally execute /sbin/init
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:39:46] Preboot Execution Environment.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:40:19] Its all in the -> exec /sbin/init
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:41:47] They told me I couldn't use DRBL to do what I wanted in that respect I hacked at DRBL and got it working to bring up 10 nodes and divy out a Kerrighed 2.4.x kernel to all the machines.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:42:19] Then I demonstarted to the customer, the process migration and memory forking mechanism of Kerrighed.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:42:30] He was thrilled.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:42:50] I absolutely love this stuff!
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:44:13] Hacking DRBL was easy man.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:45:08] He could issue 1 command and bring all of them up.. from the master node, likewise 1 command and shut them all down.
2021-07-18 16:36:25	autopsy	[10:47:44] They were configured with WoL in S1

2021-07-18 17:07:47	tonitch	Hey, I have installed pop os on my mother's computer because she needed a simple os to get along... but since, I'v noticed that it's not that intuitive at all for newbies... I'm used to arch and I never used pop before... do you know why it's so popular ? I think i'll install manjaro...
2021-07-18 17:08:15	tonitch	and second question... do you recommend xfce or kde for newbies ?
2021-07-18 17:08:35	tonitch	maybe more "used to windaube" than newbies
2021-07-18 17:08:41	paulcarroty	yet another ubuntu clone, nothing special

2021-07-18 17:11:37	tonitch	i'll go for that then
2021-07-18 17:12:04	tonitch	and paulcarroty can I admit that i'm not the only one with really bad impression of ubuntu ?

2021-07-18 17:15:26	HumbleGuy	I added a custom PS1 prompt in .bash_profile, but i don't want it to show in linux raw terminal, only when X server starts via startx. Can i configure the custom PS1 prompt to show only when i start X server?
2021-07-18 17:15:45	tonitch	the very last ?
2021-07-18 17:15:50	paulcarroty	if you don't like X then use Y

2021-07-18 17:16:08	akik	HumbleGuy: yes you can test if your $DISPLAY is set and only then set the PS1 variable
2021-07-18 17:16:21	kurahaupo_	HumbleGuy: you mean you want it inside your terminal emulator within X windows but not in the VT console?
2021-07-18 17:16:34	HumbleGuy	kurahaupo_, yes
2021-07-18 17:16:46	kurahaupo_	check $( tty )
2021-07-18 17:17:16	kurahaupo_	The VT terminals are /dev/tty[1-9]
2021-07-18 17:17:19	HumbleGuy	akik, DISPLAY variable is not present

2021-07-18 17:18:55	djph	randomuser: I don't know about "should".  I do when it's an "error" though (e.g. script -h => stdout // you messed up => stderr)

2021-07-18 17:20:12	kurahaupo_	randomuser: There is a debate. In my opinion anything that's not the "purpose" of the program should go to stderr, including help messages. Some people think that because you've asked for the help output, then that's its purpose at that time, but I think that's stretching the point too far
2021-07-18 17:20:59	HumbleGuy	kurahaupo_, i don't get it, what is "check $( tty )"?
2021-07-18 17:21:01	kurahaupo_	My point being that stderr isn't just about "errors"
2021-07-18 17:21:14	HumbleGuy	should i replace tty with /dev/tty1?
2021-07-18 17:21:38	kurahaupo_	HumbleGuy: "check" is an ordinary English word. $( tty ) is a program fragment

2021-07-18 17:22:40	curdlesnoot	the gnu standards agree that the use of a help option should result in the standard output being used, for what it is worth.

2021-07-18 17:24:06	kurahaupo_	curdlesnoot: I'm okay with that, as long as it's not the stupid sort of program that outputs the entire help message whenever the user makes a minor typo
2021-07-18 17:24:36	curdlesnoot	kurahaupo_: yes, that's annoying.

2021-07-18 17:25:57	curdlesnoot	and obviously that would go to stderr.

2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:34:17] Rashad, what do you need to use a proxy URL?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:34:42] Rashad, just change url=to ftp:// nfs:// ssh:// vnc:// or whatever you want.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:35:28] hexnewbie, nah you're going too deep for what is happenning here.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	hexnewbie	[09:36:36] I mean, no, it happens occasionally to everybody. I've got to switch my mirror once every two years temporarily to get the correct packages
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:36:56] The baseurl or url directive decides what to use from there. this exapnds to a mirrorlist in the mirrorlist so put your proxy URL in baseurl=http://myproxy:8080/this/yum/repo
2021-07-18 20:21:10	hexnewbie	[09:37:23] And if I still using testing and/or sid, it'd be happening once a few months (security.debian.org not seems affected by this often or at all)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[09:37:41] OK actually this big comment exists in my yum.conf file: https://justpaste.it/2do3a
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[09:37:53] "# metadata_expire=90m"
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:38:07] hexnewbie, I didn't read that yeah corrupt packages by insane amounts of retransmissions on a wireless link for example on a channel that is saturated will cause yum metadata to come throiiugh until it is not corrupt and those are summed.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[09:38:34] This simply means it will install an old version instead of a newer version... no?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:38:56] Rashad, yeah thats how long before the yum metadata it gets from the toplevel SRPMS/repo/comps.xml etc .gz .bz2 .xz files are downloaded again to recheck for new packages.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:39:06] Rashad, seriously put it for 1w
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:39:51] Rashad, well, no you also have newer packages which may not be in the metadata list al all.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	hexnewbie	[09:39:52] Or zero at the moment, to verify if it is the problem, and/or clear the cache as DLange suggested
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:40:07] yum clean metadata
2021-07-18 20:21:10	hexnewbie	[09:40:16] Of course, if the proxy also caches, that won't be of much help
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[09:40:24] I always run `yum clean all` before at least the first `yum upgrade`
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[09:40:47] and also `yum clean metadata`, but after `clean all` it always finds 0 things to clean
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:40:56] Rashad, thats smooth for RHEL but for Fedora its not neccessary.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:41:41] When dnf finds old metadata it will redownload new metadata.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:42:19] Rashad, look into createrepo.py createrepo_c Anaconda and dnf/yum.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:42:27] Rashad, rpmbuild too.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:42:52] Basically RPMs are a CPIO archive with binary header and a CPIO archive payload.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:43:05] But RPM supports all sorts of shit I mean seriously.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:44:37] I made my own repo and had kernel module packages that were outr of tree compiled into RPM packages, and installed to LiveDVD LiveUSB configs that spun up a DVD ISO 9660 image and you would boot from it with the new module package and maybe nothing maybe modprobe and thats IT.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:44:53] Its good for kernel regression testing amonsgts all software is.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:45:54] Live shit is the go to for testing hardware.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:47:09] This is my website: http://www.liveprojects.info/
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[09:48:05] biopsy: 403 forbidden
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:48:14] All the kernel module packages that I had out of tree in staging and what not are all in tree now.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:48:38] rindolf, yes did you want me to host something for you?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:50:21] How much wattage does an i5 4 core processor use at MAX?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:50:38] 110 watts?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[09:51:02] biopsy: i wanted to see something in the link like in https://chucknorris.com/ (♥!)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[09:51:31] inb4 chuck is a republican...
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:53:10] rindolf, I can host some custom kernel you have or kernel module or package or spin?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[09:53:18] I'd like to know what shaq is doing in all of these commercials.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[09:53:58] the little harlot is everywhere.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:54:20] rindolf, I was providing slimmed down Fedora with just bash and yum on them. Barebones Fluxbox and not much else.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[09:54:28] biopsy: no need - i have shared hosting at hostgator.com
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:54:38] 485 MB RAM usage in Fluxbox 235 MB ISO.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[09:54:48] biopsy: no need - i rent* shared hosting at hostgator.com
2021-07-18 20:21:10	gebbione	[09:55:19] yo folks, is there a way to check if an ssh key is able to connect/auth to a server?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:55:32] Nobody EVER seen Fedora on 235MB ISO before.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[09:55:49] hah
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:55:58] gebbione, use gpg-auth?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[09:56:16] biopsy: 300 MB is peanuts for me
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:56:31] rindolf, yeah thats righttttt.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:56:54] You know who we be.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:57:28] Red to the Blue to the what the peanut.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	gebbione	[09:57:51] biopsy, i have no clue that could be done
2021-07-18 20:21:10	gebbione	[09:58:10] googling but if you have something to suggest do share
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[09:59:18] biopsy: do note https://www.wired.com/2016/04/average-webpage-now-size-original-doom/ though
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[09:59:25] No I need to know how much wattage an i5 4 core processor will utilize at 100% CPU time.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[10:00:57] rindolf, http://vhhgfamilyhistory.org
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:01:22] biopsy: many web workers don't care enough about craftmanship
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:02:24] rindolf: https://davenold.net/category/chickenshit-minimalism/
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:02:37] biopsy: what about that page?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:04:17] Kyv: ah
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:04:22] related: https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:05:27] idlewords is  the worst blog on the web
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[10:05:28] rindolf, thats a replacement for my lost forum (SMF) that the hosting company pushed us to upgrade PHP and MySQL we were using, so now its not something we pay for. Thats my wordpress (And Venus Beaty's) wordpress forum informational website for ancestry in Valley Head where she was born.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[10:07:10] This is my grandpa: http://vhhgfamilyhistory.org/chopper-down-beaty-and-crew-walk-away/ He was a helicopter pilot he flew Hueys.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:07:14] biopsy: i see. «When wishing to comment on a WordPress blog, Summer Glau finds a new zero-day WordPress SQL injection exploit, and uses it to insert the comment into the database directly, because even she cannot rely on its comment box to work.»
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:07:30] rindolf: I sense envy.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:07:44] Kyv: why?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[10:08:02] Kyv, I sense you guys are all in the wrong channel here.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	biopsy	[10:08:17] Like a flock of lost birds.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:08:55] biopsy: we got offtopic - sorry
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:09:04] rindolf: if you feel the need to attack something, attack the points in the article.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	paulcarroty	[10:09:40] wp is garbage in security aspect, it's well known
2021-07-18 20:21:10	paulcarroty	[10:09:58] maybe for decade or two
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:10:03] I'm not afraid.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:10:09] autopsy: Nope, its the right channel.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:10:16] I wasn't afraid when SMF had an update either.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	hexnewbie	[10:11:57] The security problems of WordPress arise from people not updating (especially their plugins and themes), and using dangerously insecure plugins and themes, and using warez plugins and themes which have no updates for them at all, and are from the last century. The security of WP itself is not wonderful, but it's a tough competition there
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:13:05] Kyv: i was attacking the site itself. that post suffers from its general flaws of being 'TL;DR'y
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:13:19] WP has been solid since we started using it after the SMF mysqldump of the data base and the install.php failed to jive under the new MySQL version 5.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:13:40] Kyv: i was attacking the site itself. that post *also* suffers from its general flaws of being 'TL;DR'y
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:14:10] My grandpa was a veteran son.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:14:24] He went in, and took the wounded OUT.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:14:35] Vietnam cmon.. what?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:16:31] Crush your skeleton to fuc*ing gelatin.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:17:13] rindolf: it sounds like  you're a bit sore cause they laugh at Maciej Ceglowski's jokes at Maciej Ceglowski's keynotes.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:19:44] This is me: http://vhhgfamilyhistory.org/wp-content/gallery/hartline-family-photos/Jasper1986.jpg
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:20:47] Kyv: dont know who Maciej is. OTOH, a physiotherapist my sister brought in did not know who Emma Watson is...
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:22:01] Don't play me too close cause I'm no comedian.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:22:29] ( Hint: she is the actress who played https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger )
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:23:25] autopsy: cute photo
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:23:34] rindolf: he had done the 'website obesity crisis' talk linked below, which was the part that was relevant here.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	 *	autopsy [10:23:47] been doing this shit since diapers
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:23:56] I dont know or care about a blog
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:26:08] I also will probably never see it again
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:26:48] I keep opening stuff in Firefox what is it gtk-open that handles URLS?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:27:08] I want it to open in Seamonkey Seamonkey is way faster than firefox.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:27:12] Kyv: i've written this FAQ entry which i feel is much shorter and more informative: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/site_loads_quickly.xhtml
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:28:19] rindolf, very informative I see.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:29:09] rindolf, can you boot a 10 node thin client cluster and configure one over messenger with a guy 900 miles away? Using TFTPd a PXE kernel and what loads fast oh yes 10 NFS root filesystems.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:29:32] Haha.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:29:41] I see you cat gator your tongue.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:29:48] alligator potatoe!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:29:56] Whattuppo rindolf?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:30:19] Learning I take it.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:30:27] Nope...
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:30:33] Hippopatamus!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:31:12] wallowed in the mud and chewed his spicy hippo plankton food
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:31:16] autopsy: thanks for the compliment, and i know nothing about pxe... ask an expert
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:31:28] I'll ask the channel.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:31:39] Does anybody know what PXE even is?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:32:46] We set up an district managers station with 4 monitors when they had two headed video cards, two in the box 4 on top, and he called it GOLIATH.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:33:16] I could find the pictures if you want to see them.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:33:39] Thats when Xorg needed DeviceID and BusIds specified for every viewport there... yeah that was easy!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:34:50] We were playing rubix cube with the positioning of the VGA cables into the heads and the two cards in thier slots, that was cool as rice.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:35:22] autopsy: has the liquor store clerk seen your baby pictures?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:35:29] Monitor0 RightOf Monitor1 etc etcd.

2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:38:15] autopsy: how about a baofeng
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:38:17] PXE is Pre eXEcution environment.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:38:56] It is where the server boots from the network interface by downloading over TFTPd a small kernel image that is uncompressed and executed from RAM only... no disk here.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[10:39:14] preboot
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:39:27] Then you set up the root filesystem and switch_root or pivot_root whichever you prefer. And finally execute /sbin/init
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:39:46] Preboot Execution Environment.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:40:19] Its all in the -> exec /sbin/init
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:41:47] They told me I couldn't use DRBL to do what I wanted in that respect I hacked at DRBL and got it working to bring up 10 nodes and divy out a Kerrighed 2.4.x kernel to all the machines.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:42:19] Then I demonstarted to the customer, the process migration and memory forking mechanism of Kerrighed.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:42:30] He was thrilled.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:42:50] I absolutely love this stuff!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:44:13] Hacking DRBL was easy man.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:45:08] He could issue 1 command and bring all of them up.. from the master node, likewise 1 command and shut them all down.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:47:44] They were configured with WoL in S1
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Sayona	[10:51:17] Hello
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Sayona	[10:51:58] Anyone know where I can get tutorials for "RH403 – Red Hat Satellite 6 Administration" ? or something similar with this? I want to learn Satellite.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	rindolf	[10:54:26] Sayona: hi, perhaps ask elsewhere
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Sayona	[10:55:09] lol
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:57:53] Sayona, https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.2/html/server_administration_guide/index
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Sayona	[10:58:23] thanks autopsy
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[10:59:41] Sayona, RedHat beats out all other contestants in thier ingenuity and thier craftsmanship it in the proof in the pudding.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Sayona	[11:00:45] what :))
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[11:09:12] Wattage	5	77 watts
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[11:09:36] I'm going to power up an i5 board right now.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[11:37:47] Hey, I have installed pop os on my mother's computer because she needed a simple os to get along... but since, I'v noticed that it's not that intuitive at all for newbies... I'm used to arch and I never used pop before... do you know why it's so popular ? I think i'll install manjaro...
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[11:38:15] and second question... do you recommend xfce or kde for newbies ?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[11:38:34] maybe more "used to windaube" than newbies
2021-07-18 20:21:10	paulcarroty	[11:38:41] yet another ubuntu clone, nothing special
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jaafarrc	[11:40:10] My Wacom tablet gets recognized but nothing happens when I try to use the tablet.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	paulcarroty	[11:40:26] kde is definitely bad choice if you wanna "simple os"
2021-07-18 20:21:10	wigums	[11:40:52] xfce is nice for begginers imo. start menu and whatnot
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[11:41:03] paulcarroty: what's so bad with it?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[11:41:13] paulcarroty: don't know, I use bspwm since i'm on linux
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[11:41:37] i'll go for that then
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[11:42:04] and paulcarroty can I admit that i'm not the only one with really bad impression of ubuntu ?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	paulcarroty	[11:42:46] akik: shitload of configs, you need to google the right one
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[11:44:02] btw, I don't know if I hate pop os or gnome more in this case...
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[11:44:44] paulcarroty: you don't need to touch them to use plasma
2021-07-18 20:21:10	paulcarroty	[11:45:14] well, gnome 40 worth to try anyway
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:45:26] I added a custom PS1 prompt in .bash_profile, but i don't want it to show in linux raw terminal, only when X server starts via startx. Can i configure the custom PS1 prompt to show only when i start X server?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[11:45:45] the very last ?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	paulcarroty	[11:45:50] if you don't like X then use Y
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[11:46:08] HumbleGuy: yes you can test if your $DISPLAY is set and only then set the PS1 variable
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:46:21] HumbleGuy: you mean you want it inside your terminal emulator within X windows but not in the VT console?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:46:34] kurahaupo_, yes
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:46:46] check $( tty )
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:47:16] The VT terminals are /dev/tty[1-9]
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:47:19] akik, DISPLAY variable is not present
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:47:55] is not delcared
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:47:58] declared
2021-07-18 20:21:10	randomuser	[11:48:01] Hello, should help messages be printed to stderr?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[11:48:25] HumbleGuy: oh yea forgot about wayland
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:48:47] i dont use wayland
2021-07-18 20:21:10	djph	[11:48:55] randomuser: I don't know about "should".  I do when it's an "error" though (e.g. script -h => stdout // you messed up => stderr)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	randomuser	[11:49:19] Ok
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:50:12] randomuser: There is a debate. In my opinion anything that's not the "purpose" of the program should go to stderr, including help messages. Some people think that because you've asked for the help output, then that's its purpose at that time, but I think that's stretching the point too far
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:50:59] kurahaupo_, i don't get it, what is "check $( tty )"?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:51:01] My point being that stderr isn't just about "errors"
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:51:14] should i replace tty with /dev/tty1?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:51:38] HumbleGuy: "check" is an ordinary English word. $( tty ) is a program fragment
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:52:02] ]# echo $( tty )
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[11:52:03] HumbleGuy: ok so DISPLAY is set in xorg and not when you're in virtual console
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:52:14] "/dev/pts/0"
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:52:14] # tty
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[11:52:40] the gnu standards agree that the use of a help option should result in the standard output being used, for what it is worth.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:53:10] case $( tty ) in /dev/tty[1-9]*) echo on VT ;; *) echo Some other tty ;; esac
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:54:06] curdlesnoot: I'm okay with that, as long as it's not the stupid sort of program that outputs the entire help message whenever the user makes a minor typo
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[11:54:36] kurahaupo_: yes, that's annoying.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:55:37] Unknown option '$1'; type $0 --help for more info
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[11:55:44] yes. that's tasteful.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[11:55:57] and obviously that would go to stderr.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:57:14] kurahaupo_, ok where i put that code? in .bashrc?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:57:47] case $( tty ) in /dev/tty[1-9]*) echo on VT ;; *) echo Some other tty ;; esac
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:57:48] HumbleGuy: wherever you normal put your PS1 setting
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[11:58:18] Obviously the echo statements are placeholders
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:59:34] kurahaupo_, instead of the echo i insert the default PS1 prompt?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	HumbleGuy	[11:59:49] settings
2021-07-18 20:21:10	randomuser	[11:59:53] Interesting. Thanks!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[12:00:38] btw, do you think it's a good idea to install manjaro over a pop os while trying to not loose stuff ?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[12:01:03] I have to check but i'm pretty sure I moved the home dir to another partition
2021-07-18 20:21:10	ThinkT510	[12:04:24] tonitch: doesn't really matter what was there since you'll need to reformat the partition anyway
2021-07-18 20:21:10	ThinkT510	[12:04:52] obviously you should backup anything you need
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:19:39] hi
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:20:17] how to pacman rigsofrods and install it in archlinux?  pacman -Ss rig does not find it.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:22:55] jason1234: it looks to be in the AUR
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:23:09] yeap  in AUR:
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:23:17] and what to do with AUR to install it?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:23:58] You learn how to use AUR.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:24:06] jason1234: use git to clone the link at AUR website, cd into dir, run makepkg, then pacman -U packagename
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:24:07] It's documented on the ArchLinux Wiki.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:24:12] (and technically unsupported)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:24:29] and do what Psi-Jack said
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:24:37] that is the only time I will ever say that
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:25:09] cd rigsofrods ; makepkg ;  cannot find hte fakeroot binary
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:25:36] installed fakeroot
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:25:49] but it tells: ERROR could not resoulve all dependeincices
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:26:21] run it with -s
2021-07-18 20:21:10	schillingklaus	[12:26:50] yay
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:27:42] makepkg -s    and root pass, could not resolve all dependiecneeeisa
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:28:22] have you read the AUR documentation yet?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	randomuser	[12:28:43] What does .TH macro do in a manpage?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	randomuser	[12:28:53] I couldn't find it in mdoc(7).
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:29:15] title section
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[12:29:33] besides, the PKGBUILD is clearly unmaintained. rigsofrods-bin looks like the better prospect.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:29:50] randomuser: groff_man(7)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	randomuser	[12:30:49] Ah, thanks!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:30:52] Psi-Jack:  this is why I am here.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:31:06] jason1234: To be told repeatedly to read the docs?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:31:20] so you need to install wxgtk,... and how to do that?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:31:40] #archlinux
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[12:32:05] you don't. as I said, the PKGBUILD is clearly unmaintained.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:32:11] i give up... thank you anyhow.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:32:11] And if you want to be spoon fed by a silver spoon, Arch Linux clearly is not for you.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	schillingklaus	[12:34:38] and if you dislike systemd, artix and obarun are vastly superior to arch
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:34:57] And yet, nobody even hinted at that.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:35:31] schillingklaus: why not devuan?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:36:28] devuan isnt arch based
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:37:38] thats the theme there
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:38:10] Heck, I'm still surprised SteamOS 3 is based on Arch. Glad I don't use that. 🙂
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:38:42] Same here, though for different reasons.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:40:34] Holy smoke.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:40:58] This is the first time I've ever seen a graphical BIOS (EUFUFEI)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:41:07] You FOOFEE
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:41:16] heh, My EFI BIOS is GUI+Mouse.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	lopid	[12:41:25] welcome to the naughties
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:41:35] Mine is mouse too I said graphical and mouse. Re read son.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[12:41:53] Psi-Jack: does that news mean, proton on other devices too will work better, not just with that steamdeck?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:41:55] Psi-Jack, how many kb is this 64 bit BIOS chip?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:42:27] akik: No clue. I get proton-ge from Flatpak of all things.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[12:42:50] Psi-Jack: oh wow that works good too?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:43:04] It works when it needs to. But, does not always, just the same.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:43:27] Psi-Jack, you gotta be looking at 4MB of BIOS chip yeah?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:43:43] autopsy: Not really sure. Never looked much into it.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	tonitch	[12:43:55] ThinkT510: yhea but I can keep my home directory?!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:44:01] Oh ok. No wonder you're not interested in my BIOS.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[12:44:39] Psi-Jack: does that flatpak include the steam client?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:44:45] No.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:44:51] Rashad, i'M BACK OK. sO. fIre if you must ;;; in the turret sight.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:44:53] Just the proton Glorious Eggroll mod
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:45:17] This 264 watt PSU powers the board and the i5 processor to nominal voltages.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:46:23] Ahhh, Nope, I am wrong on that actually.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[12:46:25] Psi-Jack: how does it work with steam client if it's contained in that flatpak?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	ThinkT510	[12:48:06] tonitch: some do, I prefer starting fresh. You'd still need to reinstall any software you use.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:48:12] Psi-Jack, cmon man we need answers that are refutable so we can scrore big on our tests. Social Engineering tests by employers.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:49:04] I wonder if the stalker series works yet
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:49:12] Psi-Jack, what do you think of IRC as opposed to Hummingbird Exceed?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:49:22] Never heard of the latter.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:49:37] Its a Windows X Windows forwarding Desktop application.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:49:56] No such thing as "X Windows"
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:50:01] Xorg.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:50:09] X windows is what its called buddy.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:50:14] Incorrect
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:50:19] Ok what is it?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:50:25] X11, X Window System
2021-07-18 20:21:10	schillingklaus	[12:50:25] who cares
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:50:26] X11R6
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:50:35] X.org

2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:50:55] I know.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	DLange	[12:51:04] autopsy: can you tone it down again? You are getting annoying again.

2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:51:22] DLange, I'm just happy yes I'm being facetious.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:51:29] schillingklaus: it is still better than any wayland discussion.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	DLange	[12:51:51] glad you are happy, autopsy. Just type less :)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[12:52:11] Type less. ON IRC MAN CMON

2021-07-18 20:21:10	DLange	[12:52:39] both
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:52:41] is it easier to run and install rigsofrods in the distro Artix?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	DLange	[12:52:47] less noise in fewer lines
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:52:51] jason1234: No
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:53:01] jason1234: you would still be installing it from the AUR.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:53:17] it is not in artix repos.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	schillingklaus	[12:53:44] what pray tell is rigsofrods?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[12:54:10] a thing no one gives any priority, it seems
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:54:26] Well, holy crap. I got Evil Genius 2 to work again by using a specific version of Proton-GE. 😀
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[12:54:40] I can finally take over the world some more. 😀
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:55:08] then, which distro would run rigsofrods for the easy to use (without systemd)?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	schillingklaus	[12:55:49] the one whioch you would have to build yourself
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[12:57:14] ogre and gtk,... rigs and rods is not easy to build oneself
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[13:02:19] jason1234: did you try the other packages listed in AUR?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Kyv	[13:02:43] apart from the one that has its version listed in red
2021-07-18 20:21:10	randomuser	[13:13:28] How should I specify long options in man pages in the SYNOPSIS section in mdoc format?

2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:33:49] cat /usr/src/linux/.config | grep -i NFS_V4_2_SSC_HELPER  it returns this: CONFIG_NFS_V4_2_SSC_HELPER=y
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:34:09] so im truly unsure how 'm' is invalid if its not set? or the output is writte nincorrectly? where 'y' is invalid where 'm' should be set? sorry if i dont make sense here
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:34:12] this ones over my head
2021-07-18 20:21:10	BluesKaj	[13:34:16] Hi all
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:39:40] m is modules, and y yes. add y, it is surely thre then
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:40:06] y is compiled in.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:40:16] m is compiled as a hot loadable module.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:40:27] yep
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:41:04] example : insmod   ....ko from your /lib/module/..../ kernel
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:41:33] The kernel has an entry point for loadable modules. The modules have en entry point for /dev/(device) through udev hooks and the kernel reads the ELF format and then the payload and executes the module code up until its main() thread which does some polling.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:42:13] The scheduler is involved so hhokks.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:42:18] Hookers man hookers!!!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	DLange	[13:43:44] edlou: try greping the old config, not the new one
2021-07-18 20:21:10	 *	autopsy [13:43:50] is in the cpupower frequency-set -d 31000000 -u 31000000
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:46:06] Hello again o/. I am inside `/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/bin` which has files like `sqlplus` or `lsnrctl`. If I execute them like this: `./sqlplus` or `./lsnrctl`, nothing happens.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:46:22] https://paste.centos.org/view/18425992
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:46:37] sqlplus should prompt for a username and password
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:46:44] It's as if they are not executed at all.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[13:46:46] Rashad: file sqlplus
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:47:00] Rashad, run: file sqlplus
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:47:06] sqlplus: empty
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:47:08] nice
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[13:47:10] lol
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:47:13] nothing works with oracle
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:47:13] Rashad, run: file lsnrctl
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:47:13] lol
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[13:47:28] how did that happen
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:47:31] and this is just installation, mind you
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:47:42] try uninstalling oracle... cannot happen
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:47:43] Well. the payload of the .bin.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	DLange	[13:47:46] still time to consider mariasql or postgres, Rashad
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:47:54] MariaSQL is good.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:47:58] MariaDB
2021-07-18 20:21:10	 *	autopsy [13:48:18] repeats everything everybody says cause hes on an i5 now.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:48:27] DLange In 10 years when I become head of DB department, I will send everyone in IT an apology for the decades of horror of using Oracle
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:48:56] and a new era shall ensue
2021-07-18 20:21:10	DLange	[13:48:59] Rashad: wrong thinking, get promoted for doing the right thing not wait to get promoted to may be change things
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:49:00] Rashad, with enough studying and script writing and coding you can write your own database formats.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:49:29] Rashad: freebsd would be there... for pro. usage in big companies, like servers
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:49:44] jason1234, yeah right, like who the library?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:49:59] DLange: yeah old one has it too
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:50:03] ok now trying yum reinstall -y oracle-database-preinstall-19c
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:50:10] autopsy: if its set as '
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:50:18] set as 'm' its ok to keep it ,regardless of the error?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:50:29] edlou, regardless of what error?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:50:35] DLange I can't set policy.. I already mentioned Postgres
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:50:38] "config:2380⚠️ symbol value 'm' invalid for PVPANIC"
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:50:43] but its set to =y in config
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:50:47] so should i change to "m" ?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:50:48] edlou, no change that to y or n
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:50:55] but that is my question :D
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[13:50:57] the not-actually-an-error-but-warning-that-it-was-wrong-and-got-repaired with edlou seems to want to fight gainst for some reason.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:51:00] why does the error say 'm' if its set to y
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[13:51:01] which*
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:51:09] edlou, symbol value invalid 'm' read cmon.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:51:14] ,,,
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:51:17] i posted the grep tho
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:51:26] edlou, invalid symbol 'm' its set to already you need it to y or n
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:51:30] cat /usr/src/linux/.config | grep -i NFS_V4_2_SSC_HELPER  it returns this: CONFIG_NFS_V4_2_SSC_HELPER=y
2021-07-18 20:21:10	esselfe	[13:51:32] edlou: there are some options that can't be 'm'
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:51:34] so ignore the warning is okay?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:51:40] wait, slow down im confusing myself! lmao
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:52:03] the warning is about 'm' module, i understand, but the config has no module set, it's just a 'y', so what is actually throwing the error? is it make olddefconfig setting it to 'y' and adjusting? or am i just confused all together
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:52:12] autopsy: why not? servers and database. oracle, for which aims/soft especially?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:52:14] im missing a key step here, sorry, trying to follow along
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:52:33] jason1234, bifg companies? Free BSD nope.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:52:55] edlou, the symbol value 'm is wrong, change it to y or n
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:52:57] autopsy: secured and stable, very stable, and reliable. vs linux?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[13:53:05] edlou: I don't know why you find it so confusing. it was "m". you executed a make target whose entire purpose is to review the .config file and transform it according to the constraints imposed by the current set of sources. it couldn't be "m". it was fixed and changed to "y".
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:53:17] jason1234, I agree with your there but FreeBSD is Californias Berkeleys OS.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:53:24] jason1234, its for college students.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:53:40] curdlesnoot: i just saw your other message in distro chat, makes more sense now i understand how you explained
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[13:53:45] edlou: ok, cool.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	edlou	[13:53:49] curdlesnoot: im backtracking the 5.12.x and 5.11. to find where the change started
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:54:18] students would be happy to run ubuntu. they believe in it, strong as a religion. ubuntu for everything
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:54:36] Rashad, I got a board with AMD Phenom processor two cores with 7 GB of RAM if you  want I can mail it to you...
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:55:18] autopsy why?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:55:21] jason1234, DUDE BSD BERKELEY SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION ITS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:55:58] autopsy: what do you mean? the license is the issue? why not this lic?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:56:02] Rashad, just because I know I can pay for it if you need another PC to run the ORACLE DATABASE STUFF.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:56:06] Arg caps lock.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[13:56:10] autopsy: BSD was created at Berkeley San Diego; FreeBSD is a derivative that they don't control
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:56:12] autopsy hahaha
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:56:23] autopsy Hardware is not a problem, the problem is the software itself
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:56:30] Ohhh.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:56:40] kurahaupo_, Ok San Diego I see.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:56:48] just try it... takes a lot of time and effort and at the end you don't know how it worked
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:57:10] and if you pull that of, try *un*installing oracle...
2021-07-18 20:21:10	jason1234	[13:57:11] kurahaupo_: San Diego supercomputer hacked by kevin mitnick ;) free kevin ;)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:57:12] cannot happen
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:57:48] Rashad, yeah it'll rm -rf $(THIS) which export this=/oracle they meant $(this)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:57:57] autopsy https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/manual-oracle-uninstall
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:58:12] Rashad, script it. All the commands.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:58:16] and that's just the happy scenario... not the one when you want to delete things because they didn't get installed properly
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:58:19] Then run it once.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:58:29] They deleted me.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	 *	autopsy [13:58:37] is deleted
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[13:58:48] well, if it's beneath /opt then it's probably self-contained. be grateful for small mercies, I suppose.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:59:03] autopsy That's why I am trying https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-projects/tree/main/OracleDatabase , which is kind enough for Oracle to provide, but I am running into issues still
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:59:21] Rashad, oh geez. Yeah yay!
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[13:59:23] autopsy The nice thing though is that if it doesn't install properly you just delete the virtual machine and start again
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[13:59:39] Rashad, Ok I didn't know the VM disk can be rm'd.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:00:11] autopsy: Using "vagrant" you just do "vagrant destroy"
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:00:17] and it takes care of the rest
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[14:00:26] vagrant destroy vagrant destruction
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[14:00:35] How about that for a command?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[14:01:02] Rashad, I'm on an i5 4 core processor board at 3.5GHz a pice with 8GB of RAM.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[14:01:30] I gotta run stress-ng on it and memotest86+ and bonnie++
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[14:01:54] See if 268 watts is enough without data corruption.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[14:02:10] The i5 uses 77 watts.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:03:29] OK so it seems that I am getting this error during installation, after which the installation script still prints "installation succeeded"...
2021-07-18 20:21:10	esselfe	[14:03:44] oh my cpu uses 34W :)
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:03:45] Exception String: Error in invoking target 'clean rat_on part_on dm_on olap_on sdo_on rac_off dnfs_off' of makefile '/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/rdbms/lib/ins_rdbms.mk'. See '<logfile>.log' for details.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:04:08] and there it says `make: *** [rat_on] Segmentation fault`
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:04:43] Now this might be my fault at this point... it says that I should turn off hyper-v, which I didn't. So I guess I'll do that now and restart maybe that is part of the problem.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:05:03] autopsy Is this an Intel NUC?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	autopsy	[14:08:10] Rashad, NUC maybe 1155 Intel i5
2021-07-18 20:21:10	esselfe	[14:09:56] everytime I read i5 or i7 I think of a BMW
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:11:06] autopsy Nice.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[14:13:36] esselfe: √-25 and √-49
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:14:10] kurahaupo_ pure evil
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:14:31] or is that not a minus sign?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[14:15:00] Rashad: yes those are square roots of negative numbers
2021-07-18 20:21:10	kurahaupo_	[14:15:30] equating to i5 & i7
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:16:46] ahhhh
2021-07-18 20:21:10	nekodesu	[14:30:24] guys
2021-07-18 20:21:10	nekodesu	[14:30:31] how fast you can you get "cat" from urandom?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	nekodesu	[14:30:32] https://files.catbox.moe/5df9y5.png
2021-07-18 20:21:10	nekodesu	[14:30:59] time grep -m1 "cat" /dev/urandom -a
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[14:32:52] don't put your cat there
2021-07-18 20:21:10	nekodesu	[14:33:07] why?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	akik	[14:34:36] they don't like being put into strange places
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[14:34:42] heh
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[14:34:50] I mean, true in many ways. 🙂
2021-07-18 20:21:10	bryan	[14:40:41] bit of an unspecific question but not sure where to look. I'm using xfce4 and since this morning the performance has been awful. It takes seconds to open the menu, start a program, or scroll in the browser. I can't see anything in htop/top that is using up anything, any advice where to start looking?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	ZenixOwler	[14:40:45] is there any good services that allows me to share files and directories locally ? assuming that the other machine which is using my shared service can either be Linux or Windows
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[14:41:07] bryan: Tried atop?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	bryan	[14:41:17] I have not
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[14:41:28] Is the whole system slow, or just xfce specifically?
2021-07-18 20:21:10	nekodesu	[14:41:49] bryan: Your system could be switching to swap
2021-07-18 20:21:10	nekodesu	[14:41:59] something might be eating your memory
2021-07-18 20:21:10	gamorck_l	[14:42:02] ZenixOwler: Just turn on ssh and use ssh on the Linux clients to grab files remotely or something like WinSCP on Windows to do it
2021-07-18 20:21:10	bryan	[14:42:06] it's hard to say, I can't really do much in just the terminal alone
2021-07-18 20:21:10	curdlesnoot	[14:42:11] nekodesu: very quickly, it seems.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	bryan	[14:42:12] I've got 32gb of ram, there's only 400mb in use
2021-07-18 20:21:10	nekodesu	[14:42:20] that's odd
2021-07-18 20:21:10	ZenixOwler	[14:42:39] gamorck_l: yea but i am intending something which can be mounted and share at an instant, SSH would require extra steps to exchange file
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Psi-Jack	[14:42:42] Check atop, and dmesg
2021-07-18 20:21:10	gamorck_l	[14:43:22] that's possible in Linux.  For example in nautilus I can access remote sftp directories directly within the app and bookmark them for easy access later.
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:43:27] bryan: please upload your ram so I can download it
2021-07-18 20:21:10	gamorck_l	[14:43:41] But in order to get that behavior in Windows, you'll have to setup samba on the Linux server
2021-07-18 20:21:10	Rashad	[14:43:57] also now everthing you say will be voiced by Seth MacFarlane in my head

2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:00:49] ryzenda: You email.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:00:54] Here's your sign.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	HaMsTeRs	[03:02:04] hingoanashi1209: rules of thumb, when troubleshooting an issue, try dig out some logs.  if you want to get help, at least show us the error message
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:02:21] HaMsTeRs: show me the money!
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	HaMsTeRs [03:02:28] twists http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?go=Go&search=R's nipples
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:02:31] don't show [[R]] the money
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:02:34] Also, rule of thumb. If you're told you're doing it wrong, and you should re-think your strategy, chances are, you should listen.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:02:35] show it to me instead
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	[[R]] [03:02:52] makes it rain all over rascul 
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	rascul [03:03:19] opens up the umbrella
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:05:45] HaMsTeRs: that is excellent advice, but the log files didn't give me any decent messages and unfortunately I was having local mail issues too that I didn't want to burden you all with yet (just not set up yet),  I always do the cron stuff first because that is the most important to get going right away
2021-07-19 11:15:19	pnbeast	[03:07:04]  /msg rascul don't tell [R] this, but my dog just pooped in his shoes
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:07:06] Psi-Jack: well in this case it doesn't apply, what I was doing was cron and nobody told me how I was doing cron wrong.  Do you tell people having trouble with linux to usd Windows instead?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:07:18] Actually, /I/ did.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:07:24] pnbeast you trained your dog well
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:07:24] I said cron was the wrong tool from the START.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:07:53] pnbeast: my cats would destroy your dog
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:07:57] hingoanashi1209 it's easy to do cron wrong, if i had any idea what you were doing i might be able to point it out
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:07:57] they're vicious
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:07:58] well I came here for help with cron.  If you like another tool, fine you use that tool. cron is the right tool for me.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:08:05] Yet, it's not.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:08:11] well its not working...
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:08:14] heh
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:08:20] START saying that MORE THEN.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:08:25] And it's going to continue to not be working. 🙂
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:08:28] CRON AINT IT BRA.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:08:33] as I said all of this works perfectly everywhere but on the 20.2 linuxmint machine
2021-07-19 11:15:19	sheep	[03:08:40] running cron from a ssystemd user session or x session migt make more sense
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:08:41] Rather than just saying "it's wrong" perhaps you should explain why it's so important that this whatever be tied to the user session
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:08:44] Brother man madre tu padre.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	sheep	[03:08:48] or this could just be some sort of bug
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:08:50] Dagmar: I did.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:08:56] hingoanashi1209 what is it that works perfectly everywhere but on the 20.2 linuxmint machine?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:09:13] all my audio cron jobs among other things
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:09:15] sorry but i'm not going through hours of backlog to find your problem
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	autopsy [03:09:16] looks at his bug tracking idealogical anuerism software tumor install of a Linux
2021-07-19 11:15:19	sheep	[03:09:18] check with mint's pulse, cron, and systemd maintainers to see if they changed anything signfiicant between releases
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[03:09:24] rascul: call espeak via cron
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:09:38] BACKLOG TIME HERE COMES AUTOPSY!!!
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:09:46] call espeak via cron doesn't sound like an inherently difficult problem
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:09:48] rascul: He uses a cron to run a naggy little espeak for a talking clock, alerts, calendar events, etc.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:10:11] it isn't just espeak, that was just the simplest example I could give and if that worked the others would too
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:10:21] what does the relevant crontab line look like?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:10:27] Oh fetaher the bone marror out to the vegetation and keep the phosphorous for me.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:10:28] like, verbatim
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:10:38] Still sounds like the sort of thing that should be routing through dbus to me
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	autopsy [03:10:45] spells really good in English
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:10:49] rascul, there are now many versions, but the stripped bare one is    espeak "testing"
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rud0lf	[03:10:49] can you make a cron job run on bank holidays?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	autopsy [03:10:53] can't miss two more keys
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:11:03] i only want to know what the latest iteration is
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:11:04] cron will run ever day every night.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:11:18] and 'espeak "testing"' is not a valid crontab line
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:11:49] DISPLAY=:0.0 XAUTHORITY=/home/nully/.Xauthority espeak "testing"
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:11:58] rud0lf: cron takes holidays off
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:12:02] still, there's more to it that you're leaving off
2021-07-19 11:15:19	sheep	[03:12:03] it might also need DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rud0lf	[03:12:06] d'oh
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:12:15] but with the variables set for the file it becomes simple again
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:12:15] That should mostly work
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rud0lf	[03:12:22] can cron call in sick too?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:12:25] like, paste the *entire* line, verbatim
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:12:27] don't edit it
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:12:32] I have DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:12:33] include the numbers and stuff at the beginning
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:12:39] as an environment variable
2021-07-19 11:15:19	sheep	[03:12:39] maybe ne needs "env" at the start of the command
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:12:40] Probably ~/.Xauthority isn't what's used in 20.04
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:12:59] I usually steal the contents of the XAUTHORITY variable from the other process' environment
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:13:04] how can I 'tail' mail?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:13:11] if you have variables and stuff defined elsewhere in the crontab, just share the entire crontab with termbin
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:13:33] context matters a whole lot with cron and if you leave it out, it can be impossible to know what is going on
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	Psi-Jack [03:14:08] goes back to taking over the world.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:14:12] and part of the missing context is when it's running because you didn't include the entire line
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:14:36] also it would be useful to know what errors you may get and where you found them at, if you were able to
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:14:38] ok, but please bear in mind I have tried every permutation of the variables and having them for the file of the command so that is a lot of permutations
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:14:53] where do you want me to put it  (I need to do some redacting first)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:15:11] see /topic for how to use termbin
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:15:31] careful with your redactions, if you redact too much then the whole thing is worthless
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:16:13] hingoanashi1209: i would like to know, how much time you've wasted on this?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:16:25] Psi-Jack: okay pinky
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	[[R]] [03:16:36] redacts all over rascul 
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	rascul [03:16:41] redacts [[R]]
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	rascul [03:17:03] also redacts any cats [[R]] may or may not have
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	rud0lf [03:17:34] flips [[R]] inside out into ]]Я[[
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:17:46] flipping doesn't unredact
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:17:53] 🎶 turn it inside out...

2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:21:34]  PATH is wrong
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:21:43] ; isn't a directory separator, : is
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:21:47] that is a replaement
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:21:52] ROFL
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:22:07] what is a replacement?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[03:22:09] rascul: 🎶 ya gotta keep em separated
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:22:29] Dont pay no mind if you're under 18 you wont be doin any tiiiiiime.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:22:37] the actual PATH has :, I just had to redact so wrote it out by hand, typos, sorry
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:22:58] and we get back to "careful with your redactions, if you redact too much then the whole thing is worthless"
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:23:08] Actually ; is a directory seperator in $PATH too.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:23:23] anyway all non-audio commands have been working perfectly
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:23:26] autopsy go away
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:23:32] I know, sorry
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:23:36] rascul go on to me.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:23:51] I just had a bunch of private paths in there
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:24:15] the only other redaction was the $USER
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:24:38] oh autopsy?  really?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:25:08] hingoanashi1209 no, ; is not a path separator, and private paths mean not a damn thing
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:25:25] nobody cares what directories you have in ~
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:25:26] I meant that the directory names were confidential
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Psi-Jack	[03:25:39] "confidential" directory names.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:25:42] that seems a bit delusional
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:25:43] ugh

2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:26:09] if you can't provide the necessary information, i'm not sure how much help can be provided
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:26:15] we really need verbatim stuff
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:26:27] well that was just one version
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:26:34] it wasn't a working one
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:26:39] all the other commands work
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:26:40] and it wasn't what you were running
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:26:58] and i can't tell you what is wrong because you edited it and introduced errors in the editing
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:27:05] Ye3ah your directory names dont mean shit to anybody here especially not rascul or [[R]] right R?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:27:12] autopsy go away
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:27:16] I can remove those directories temporarily and run it that way and then put up what I did if you think that is necesary

2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:28:14] you need to share the information requested if you want useful help
2021-07-19 11:15:19	autopsy	[03:28:35] SHARE AND GET HELP OR GO DOWN THE TRIAN WRECK LOOP THAT IS YOU
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:28:58] autopsy just go to -offtopic and stay there and everything will be ok forever
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Kyv	[03:30:01] no
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Kyv	[03:30:15] there is decorum
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Kyv	[03:30:39] it has to be mounded
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:31:38] ok this is how it is running now: https://termbin.com/ryw9
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:31:55] still everything else works but no sound output
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:32:44] i'm not sure that $USER is set in crontab
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:33:11] maybe try setting that explicitly
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[03:33:25] yep, and it won't be expanded
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:33:48] does espeak need x?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:33:52] X or whatever
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:34:40] my espeak doesn't appear to be directly linked to any X things so maybe DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY don't matter for this
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:35:17] maybe add "&>> /tmp/espeak-cron.log" or something like that to get output somewhere
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:35:33] might need to go in a script, cron can be funny sometimes
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:35:49] probably best to put it in a scriptt anyway, because cron can be funny sometimes
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[03:36:03] here    * * * * * espeak "blabla"    in my crontab just works (debian 10)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	sheep	[03:36:19] not working for me on gentoo with systemd and cronie
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:36:49] I am just not putting my username on my home computer in an irc channel
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[03:36:50] well here it's Vixie Cron
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:37:12] it is the actual username in the crontab file
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:37:15] hingoanashi1209 you have an odd idea of things that matter
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:37:49] btw my username is rascul
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:38:10] my ip is 127.94.218.77
2021-07-19 11:15:19	pnbeast	[03:38:25] rascul, what does "matter" mean?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[03:38:37] dark matter?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:38:57] pnbeast the substance of which a physical object is composed
2021-07-19 11:15:19	pnbeast	[03:39:17] I think rascul uses zero point energy to power a dark matter power supply in his computer.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:39:55] my zero point modules are nearly depleted and i'm stuck underwater
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:41:10] so it seems cron won't use bash's paths
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:41:16] which makes sense i guess
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:41:36] cron doesn't have the environment you might expect
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:42:08] i hardcoded the executable path, though I guess i could have ran bash itself to run the commands?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:42:57] maybe, depends on how bash is invoked
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:42:58] ok, finally sending some useful info https://termbin.com/9r7f
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:44:06] rascul, what I do is run a bash script
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:44:14] so it was already invoked in some way
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:44:32] and script couldn't find an executable
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:45:16] it was a program in the go path
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:45:28] hingoanashi1209 looks like some crazy asla stuff going on but maybe in a few minutes when I finish my cigarette and go back to the desktop I might be able to decipher it
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:45:28] where go install programs
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:46:27] madprops if you share the crontab and the script it would be helpful
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:46:51] I was gonna but you'd demand termbin and it was a bit inconvenient
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:46:56] since my email is there
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:47:09] I don't care if it's termbin
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:47:39] I'm going to run the exact same things on the other machines and compare the output
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:47:53] i think it's fixed though
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[03:47:57] will find out in a while
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:48:08] usually a redacted email address won't hurt in this context
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Kyv	[03:48:46] what is this some kinna FOIA request
2021-07-19 11:15:19	 *	Kyv [03:49:01] kicks over public trash
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:50:09] I have SHELL=/bin/bash at the beginning of my crontab file
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:50:53] hingoanashi1209 have you done anything with asoundrc?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:51:04] no
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:51:34] nor did I in the ones that worked
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:53:15] hingoanashi1209 what distro is it?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:53:40] if worse comes to worse I'll use a cronjob from one of the other computers and have them ssh in and espeak on this one
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:54:23] linuxmint 20.2 for the failure, 20.1 x 2 and 19.x for the working ones (not to mention fedora, xubuntu, zorin, etc also all working)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:54:38] working on the same box?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:54:48] no, different boxes
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:54:59] not sure it's relevant, then
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[03:55:10] hingoanashi1209: I assume you checked the user is in the audio group? (just for sure)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:55:12] the hardware differs
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:55:14] they are all thumbdrives and the thumbdrives from the other distros work on this machine
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[03:55:41] well audio is otherwise perfect so I just assumed it was
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:55:58] does 'espeak "testing"' work as the target user when done manually?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:56:01] If they're "live" environments ther'es a reaosn they're working and normal install wouldn't
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:56:21] For a live environment you can make some really crude decisions about who gets read/write on the audio devices
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[03:56:48] hingoanashi1209: groups | grep -o audio      displays audio?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:56:57] Odds are there that they would just have membership in group audio and it would get them rw
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:57:25] mine uses an audio group? i didn't know, was curious
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:57:30] s/mine/mint/
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:58:19] For multi-user that's the sort of thing that's typically brokered via pam_console or similar so the user only gets that group when they're _at_ the console
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:58:58] In those cases, cron jobs and ssh sessions would not have automatic rw on audio devices
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[03:59:10] i don't have any debian flavored installs with audio to compare with
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[03:59:52] This is part of why I kept dropping hints about dbus
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:00:30] You can send a message to users' session with it from pretty much anything and just have a script catch it for the user and do the thing
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:00:52] espeak needs dbus?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:01:04] No, but it's going to need write access to the audio device
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:01:22] If it's launched by _something in X listening for dbus notifications_ it'll have all it needs
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:01:32] It'll also _not_ sound off when the user isn't logged in
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:02:12] This is sort of a "render unto Caesar" sort of thing with respect to why dbus isn't a complete waste of resources
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:03:06] quick glance at 'strace espeak testing' doesn't show anything related to dbus or X
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:03:43] I have to say.  I'm not really sure why you're even worrying about X
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:03:54] you're the one who mentioned it
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:04:15] You have seen the little notification windows popping up when using KDE/GNOME, right?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:04:24] i don't use kde/gnome
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:04:40] so... no
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:04:57] Ah, well, for things like the system noticing an email just came in or whatever calendaring alarm just went off, that's how those messages happen
2021-07-19 11:15:19	ginger-fox	[04:05:10] does anyone know if cat /dev/urandom > /dev/audio works
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:05:23] what does that have to do with running espeak from crontab though?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:05:27] ginger-fox: It plays unreleased Skrillex tracsk
2021-07-19 11:15:19	ginger-fox	[04:05:33] Dagmar: nice
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:05:50] odd if I grep for audio (or $USER) in /etc/groups it is there but it isn't listed with the groups command
2021-07-19 11:15:19	ginger-fox	[04:05:55] ahahahaha
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:06:02] rascul: Cron jobs don't necessarily get access to the sound devices.  Using something from cron to just send a message over dbus, you don't have to care about a whole host of potential issues
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:06:20] that is very strange
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:06:25] Dagmar i'm not convinced dbus is involved at this point
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:06:32] *sigh* It's not involved.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:06:36] It _should_ be involved.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:07:00] why?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:07:06] espeak appears to work fine without it
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:07:06] espeak isn't complex software.  You give it a string, it turns it into wav and then tries to play it
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:07:10] yes
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:07:15] it doesn't need dbus for that
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:07:26] ...but if your cron jobs don't have write access to audio devices, you're dead in the water.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:07:27] and that is the first thing I find different between the other installations and this one and it certainly seems relevant akoana
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:07:32] sure
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:07:33] hingoanashi1209: so     sudo adduser <user> audio
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:07:45] i think we were trying to figure that part out, if the cron job had access to the audio device
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:07:53] then you went on a rant about dbus
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:07:59] Not a rant.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:08:02] and apparently we're back to the point before the rant
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:08:09] <user> is already a member of audio
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:08:11] is the output
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:08:21] I'd almost put money on that you _don't_ get automatic access to audio devices
2021-07-19 11:15:19	evilscreww	[04:08:57] my computer wasnt booting up properly (said: non system disk error strike any key when ready). so i changed ahci mode to IDE mode now its booting fine (albeit sluggishly)...
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:08:59] and groups still doesn't list audio
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:08:59] This is a security problem that's been around for some time, and it's pretty much the reason most distros got and started using pam_console
2021-07-19 11:15:19	evilscreww	[04:09:03] even though my boot drive is plugged into sata.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:09:09] something is wrong here akoana
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:09:33] On a multi-user box, you can't grant people who aren't at the console read-write to the audio devices because it leads to mischief and mayhem
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:09:36] on all the other systems groups lists audio
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:09:56] on this system /etc/groups lists <user> in the audio group though
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:09:58] weird
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:10:17] hingoanashi1209: yeah if you add your account to the audio group _perpetually_ by just throwing your username on the end of the line in /etc/groups an relog the problem will proabbly go away
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:10:18] what group owns the files in /dev/snd/  (ls -l /dev/snd/)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:10:20] ?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Kyv	[04:10:42] There is usually no need to add your user to the audio group, as PulseAudio uses udev and logind to give access dynamically to the currently active user.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:10:48] ...and never underestimate the mayhem one can do with remote access to speakers
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[04:10:57] Kyv: except hes not in a session when hes running this
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:11:09] Kyv: Except cron jobs don't get that
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Kyv	[04:11:20] ah
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:11:20] hingoanashi1209: maybe paste the output of  ls -l /dev/snd/  to termbin.com
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Kyv	[04:11:23] scrollback comprehension
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Kyv	[04:11:26] I'll work on it
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:11:35] They're not part of a user session that is for 100% certain at the physical console
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:12:11] relog?  Dagmar
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:12:16] Log out and log back in
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:12:17] oh login again?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:12:20] Yeah.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:12:27] oh ok, but I'll be gone for a sec then
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:12:45] /etc/group is just a file.  What's in it doesn't come into play until a new session is created
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:13:02] So, once youv'e added yourself to the audio group, when you log back in you'll be a member of audio group
2021-07-19 11:15:19	Dagmar	[04:13:21] Then your cron jobs will _also_ have the audio group attribute
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:02] back
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:08] and feeling like an idiot
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:15] it is working perfectly now
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:22] thank you all for all your patience
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:17:31] it's not patience it's just irc
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:17:41] just thank libera ;)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:17:47] welcome to the audio groupies ;)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:48] I didn't think audio would work from the cli if the user wasn't in the audio group so I completely overlooked that.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:18:20] you folks were wonderful (for the mostpart :) )
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:18:28] it now works like a charm
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:18:42] of course after all that it had to be something really really simple and obvious
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:18:43] sorry
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:18:51] so it was even possible without systemd :)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:19:14] the ONLY problem was that the user wasn't in the audio group
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:19:34] I can get rid of all those other things and it still works like a charm
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:20:07] well I've been using cron this way since the 90s so it certainly works without systemd :)
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:20:16] everything works without systemd
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:20:25] or at least it did before systemd came along
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:20:27] so true rascul
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:20:39] I've been tempted to move to Devuan
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:20:41] systemd has some nice stuff though
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[04:21:12] systemd is the devil!
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:21:40] it does have some nice stuff but a lot is done clumsily and it is so counter to one thing makes linux so wonderful -- its modularity --- erase that I don't want to start a flame war if it isn't too late already
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:21:45] rascul: there were some people here, claiming it wouldn't work with cron - lol
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:22:00] oh
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:22:11] probably in the backlog that i skipped because it was hours long
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:22:31] well I have 10 other systems with systemd on which cron has been working exactly as I wanted it so I knew that was ...
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:22:35] or maybe i didn't care enough to remember that someone said it
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:22:55] cron does work fine with systemd though
2021-07-19 11:15:19	hingoanashi1209	[04:22:58] oh I would have erased that part from my memory too if I could have rascul
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[04:23:00] no one said it woudln't work
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:23:01] yeah, I'm not saying a systemd timer would not be ok ...
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rascul	[04:23:11] i do prefer the timers
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[04:23:13] just that it would be better to do it the corret way
2021-07-19 11:15:19	akoana	[04:23:48] Psi-Jack> I said cron was the wrong tool from the START
2021-07-19 11:15:19	ginger-fox	[04:23:52] msg nickserv identify password123

2021-07-19 11:15:19	evilscreww	[04:55:51] just curious. are there ppl here who are always on bleeding edge kernel
2021-07-19 11:15:19	evilscreww	[04:55:59] or do they stick with the long term supported one
2021-07-19 11:15:19	sheep	[04:56:18] I usually use the most recent not RC release
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[04:56:38] evilscreww: most people just stick with what the dist provides
2021-07-19 11:15:19	evilscreww	[04:56:42] yeh of course id probably only stick with stable
2021-07-19 11:15:19	evilscreww	[04:56:57] right well mine provides a plethora of options here...

2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[04:57:58] most people just use a sane dist...
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[05:03:17] how can I log all the directories visited by cd? is inspecting the 'history' the only way?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[05:03:48] madprops: you could make a function called cd, every time its called, call the builtin cd, and then save the directory to a log file
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[05:04:12] hmm
2021-07-19 11:15:19	sheep	[05:04:18] you could also switch to using pushd/popd/dirs
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[05:04:32] i just want to make a better z.sh
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[05:04:39] what is z.sh
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[05:04:57] https://github.com/rupa/z
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[05:05:03] you can't just tell us?
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[05:05:12] yeah basically it remembers location you visit
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[05:05:17] so you can do "z somelocation"
2021-07-19 11:15:19	madprops	[05:05:23] but it's not very accurate

2021-07-19 11:15:19	rud0lf	[05:09:01] newbie in bash scripting here...
2021-07-19 11:15:19	astronaut	[05:13:09] rud0lf, if you are planning to use the script personally, use a sane scripting instead of bash like fish or tcl.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rud0lf	[05:13:32] but i want it as a practice
2021-07-19 11:15:19	rud0lf	[05:14:24] hm fixed it with "$(...)"
2021-07-19 11:15:19	astronaut	[05:15:06] for the expression above, you should look into awk
2021-07-19 11:15:19	[[R]]	[05:15:27] tcl... sane...

2021-07-19 11:15:19	evilscreww	[05:38:18] hey im kinda noob to linux. which one of these am i supposed to download
2021-07-19 11:15:19	astronaut	[05:40:37] If you have any of those distro then download the specific version. If not then the AppImage one would run on any distro.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	evilscreww	[05:41:38] i think im debian
2021-07-19 11:15:19	astronaut	[05:42:12] [[R]], I think tcl is a beautiful and timeless language.
2021-07-19 11:15:19	astronaut	[05:44:23] I don't know what CPU-X is, but you can download and install the Debian one. You might have to extract and there should be a binary file that you can run.

2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:27:44] you're not hiding anything that matters
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Topco	[03:27:45] i believe in you
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	autopsy [03:27:50] drinks a little rascul
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:28:01] there's a plethora of things that could be wrong and still have non-audio commands work perfectly
2021-07-19 11:45:31	autopsy	[03:28:14] LIKEWISE
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:28:14] you need to share the information requested if you want useful help
2021-07-19 11:45:31	autopsy	[03:28:35] SHARE AND GET HELP OR GO DOWN THE TRIAN WRECK LOOP THAT IS YOU
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:28:58] autopsy just go to -offtopic and stay there and everything will be ok forever
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kyv	[03:30:01] no
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kyv	[03:30:15] there is decorum
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kyv	[03:30:39] it has to be mounded
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:31:38] ok this is how it is running now: https://termbin.com/ryw9
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:31:55] still everything else works but no sound output
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:32:44] i'm not sure that $USER is set in crontab
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:33:11] maybe try setting that explicitly
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[03:33:25] yep, and it won't be expanded
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:33:48] does espeak need x?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:33:52] X or whatever
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:34:40] my espeak doesn't appear to be directly linked to any X things so maybe DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY don't matter for this
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:35:17] maybe add "&>> /tmp/espeak-cron.log" or something like that to get output somewhere
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:35:33] might need to go in a script, cron can be funny sometimes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:35:49] probably best to put it in a scriptt anyway, because cron can be funny sometimes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[03:36:03] here    * * * * * espeak "blabla"    in my crontab just works (debian 10)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	sheep	[03:36:19] not working for me on gentoo with systemd and cronie
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:36:49] I am just not putting my username on my home computer in an irc channel
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[03:36:50] well here it's Vixie Cron
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:37:12] it is the actual username in the crontab file
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:37:15] hingoanashi1209 you have an odd idea of things that matter
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:37:49] btw my username is rascul
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:38:10] my ip is 127.94.218.77
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pnbeast	[03:38:25] rascul, what does "matter" mean?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[03:38:37] dark matter?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:38:57] pnbeast the substance of which a physical object is composed
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pnbeast	[03:39:17] I think rascul uses zero point energy to power a dark matter power supply in his computer.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:39:55] my zero point modules are nearly depleted and i'm stuck underwater
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:41:10] so it seems cron won't use bash's paths
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:41:16] which makes sense i guess
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:41:36] cron doesn't have the environment you might expect
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:42:08] i hardcoded the executable path, though I guess i could have ran bash itself to run the commands?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:42:57] maybe, depends on how bash is invoked
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:42:58] ok, finally sending some useful info https://termbin.com/9r7f
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:44:06] rascul, what I do is run a bash script
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:44:14] so it was already invoked in some way
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:44:32] and script couldn't find an executable
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:45:16] it was a program in the go path
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:45:28] hingoanashi1209 looks like some crazy asla stuff going on but maybe in a few minutes when I finish my cigarette and go back to the desktop I might be able to decipher it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:45:28] where go install programs
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:46:27] madprops if you share the crontab and the script it would be helpful
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:46:51] I was gonna but you'd demand termbin and it was a bit inconvenient
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:46:56] since my email is there
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:47:09] I don't care if it's termbin
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:47:39] I'm going to run the exact same things on the other machines and compare the output
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:47:53] i think it's fixed though
2021-07-19 11:45:31	madprops	[03:47:57] will find out in a while
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:48:08] usually a redacted email address won't hurt in this context
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kyv	[03:48:46] what is this some kinna FOIA request
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	Kyv [03:49:01] kicks over public trash
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:50:09] I have SHELL=/bin/bash at the beginning of my crontab file
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:50:53] hingoanashi1209 have you done anything with asoundrc?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:51:04] no
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:51:34] nor did I in the ones that worked
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:53:15] hingoanashi1209 what distro is it?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:53:40] if worse comes to worse I'll use a cronjob from one of the other computers and have them ssh in and espeak on this one
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:54:23] linuxmint 20.2 for the failure, 20.1 x 2 and 19.x for the working ones (not to mention fedora, xubuntu, zorin, etc also all working)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:54:38] working on the same box?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:54:48] no, different boxes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:54:59] not sure it's relevant, then
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[03:55:10] hingoanashi1209: I assume you checked the user is in the audio group? (just for sure)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:55:12] the hardware differs
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:55:14] they are all thumbdrives and the thumbdrives from the other distros work on this machine
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[03:55:41] well audio is otherwise perfect so I just assumed it was
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:55:58] does 'espeak "testing"' work as the target user when done manually?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[03:56:01] If they're "live" environments ther'es a reaosn they're working and normal install wouldn't
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[03:56:21] For a live environment you can make some really crude decisions about who gets read/write on the audio devices
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[03:56:48] hingoanashi1209: groups | grep -o audio      displays audio?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[03:56:57] Odds are there that they would just have membership in group audio and it would get them rw
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:57:25] mine uses an audio group? i didn't know, was curious
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:57:30] s/mine/mint/
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[03:58:19] For multi-user that's the sort of thing that's typically brokered via pam_console or similar so the user only gets that group when they're _at_ the console
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[03:58:58] In those cases, cron jobs and ssh sessions would not have automatic rw on audio devices
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[03:59:10] i don't have any debian flavored installs with audio to compare with
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[03:59:52] This is part of why I kept dropping hints about dbus
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:00:30] You can send a message to users' session with it from pretty much anything and just have a script catch it for the user and do the thing
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:00:52] espeak needs dbus?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:01:04] No, but it's going to need write access to the audio device
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:01:22] If it's launched by _something in X listening for dbus notifications_ it'll have all it needs
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:01:32] It'll also _not_ sound off when the user isn't logged in
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:02:12] This is sort of a "render unto Caesar" sort of thing with respect to why dbus isn't a complete waste of resources
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:03:06] quick glance at 'strace espeak testing' doesn't show anything related to dbus or X
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:03:43] I have to say.  I'm not really sure why you're even worrying about X
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:03:54] you're the one who mentioned it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:04:15] You have seen the little notification windows popping up when using KDE/GNOME, right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:04:24] i don't use kde/gnome
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:04:40] so... no
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:04:57] Ah, well, for things like the system noticing an email just came in or whatever calendaring alarm just went off, that's how those messages happen
2021-07-19 11:45:31	ginger-fox	[04:05:10] does anyone know if cat /dev/urandom > /dev/audio works
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:05:23] what does that have to do with running espeak from crontab though?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:05:27] ginger-fox: It plays unreleased Skrillex tracsk
2021-07-19 11:45:31	ginger-fox	[04:05:33] Dagmar: nice
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:05:50] odd if I grep for audio (or $USER) in /etc/groups it is there but it isn't listed with the groups command
2021-07-19 11:45:31	ginger-fox	[04:05:55] ahahahaha
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:06:02] rascul: Cron jobs don't necessarily get access to the sound devices.  Using something from cron to just send a message over dbus, you don't have to care about a whole host of potential issues
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:06:20] that is very strange
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:06:25] Dagmar i'm not convinced dbus is involved at this point
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:06:32] *sigh* It's not involved.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:06:36] It _should_ be involved.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:07:00] why?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:07:06] espeak appears to work fine without it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:07:06] espeak isn't complex software.  You give it a string, it turns it into wav and then tries to play it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:07:10] yes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:07:15] it doesn't need dbus for that
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:07:26] ...but if your cron jobs don't have write access to audio devices, you're dead in the water.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:07:27] and that is the first thing I find different between the other installations and this one and it certainly seems relevant akoana
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:07:32] sure
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:07:33] hingoanashi1209: so     sudo adduser <user> audio
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:07:45] i think we were trying to figure that part out, if the cron job had access to the audio device
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:07:53] then you went on a rant about dbus
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:07:59] Not a rant.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:08:02] and apparently we're back to the point before the rant
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:08:09] <user> is already a member of audio
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:08:11] is the output
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:08:21] I'd almost put money on that you _don't_ get automatic access to audio devices
2021-07-19 11:45:31	evilscreww	[04:08:57] my computer wasnt booting up properly (said: non system disk error strike any key when ready). so i changed ahci mode to IDE mode now its booting fine (albeit sluggishly)...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:08:59] and groups still doesn't list audio
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:08:59] This is a security problem that's been around for some time, and it's pretty much the reason most distros got and started using pam_console
2021-07-19 11:45:31	evilscreww	[04:09:03] even though my boot drive is plugged into sata.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:09:09] something is wrong here akoana
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:09:33] On a multi-user box, you can't grant people who aren't at the console read-write to the audio devices because it leads to mischief and mayhem
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:09:36] on all the other systems groups lists audio
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:09:56] on this system /etc/groups lists <user> in the audio group though
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:09:58] weird
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:10:17] hingoanashi1209: yeah if you add your account to the audio group _perpetually_ by just throwing your username on the end of the line in /etc/groups an relog the problem will proabbly go away
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:10:18] what group owns the files in /dev/snd/  (ls -l /dev/snd/)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:10:20] ?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kyv	[04:10:42] There is usually no need to add your user to the audio group, as PulseAudio uses udev and logind to give access dynamically to the currently active user.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:10:48] ...and never underestimate the mayhem one can do with remote access to speakers
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[[R]]	[04:10:57] Kyv: except hes not in a session when hes running this
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:11:09] Kyv: Except cron jobs don't get that
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kyv	[04:11:20] ah
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:11:20] hingoanashi1209: maybe paste the output of  ls -l /dev/snd/  to termbin.com
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kyv	[04:11:23] scrollback comprehension
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kyv	[04:11:26] I'll work on it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:11:35] They're not part of a user session that is for 100% certain at the physical console
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:12:11] relog?  Dagmar
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:12:16] Log out and log back in
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:12:17] oh login again?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:12:20] Yeah.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:12:27] oh ok, but I'll be gone for a sec then
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:12:45] /etc/group is just a file.  What's in it doesn't come into play until a new session is created
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:13:02] So, once youv'e added yourself to the audio group, when you log back in you'll be a member of audio group
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Dagmar	[04:13:21] Then your cron jobs will _also_ have the audio group attribute
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:02] back
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:08] and feeling like an idiot
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:15] it is working perfectly now
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:22] thank you all for all your patience
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:17:31] it's not patience it's just irc
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:17:41] just thank libera ;)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:17:47] welcome to the audio groupies ;)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:17:48] I didn't think audio would work from the cli if the user wasn't in the audio group so I completely overlooked that.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:18:20] you folks were wonderful (for the mostpart :) )
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:18:28] it now works like a charm
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:18:42] of course after all that it had to be something really really simple and obvious
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:18:43] sorry
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:18:51] so it was even possible without systemd :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:19:14] the ONLY problem was that the user wasn't in the audio group
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:19:34] I can get rid of all those other things and it still works like a charm
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:20:07] well I've been using cron this way since the 90s so it certainly works without systemd :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:20:16] everything works without systemd
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:20:25] or at least it did before systemd came along
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:20:27] so true rascul
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:20:39] I've been tempted to move to Devuan
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:20:41] systemd has some nice stuff though
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[[R]]	[04:21:12] systemd is the devil!
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:21:40] it does have some nice stuff but a lot is done clumsily and it is so counter to one thing makes linux so wonderful -- its modularity --- erase that I don't want to start a flame war if it isn't too late already
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:21:45] rascul: there were some people here, claiming it wouldn't work with cron - lol
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:22:00] oh
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:22:11] probably in the backlog that i skipped because it was hours long
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:22:31] well I have 10 other systems with systemd on which cron has been working exactly as I wanted it so I knew that was ...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:22:35] or maybe i didn't care enough to remember that someone said it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:22:55] cron does work fine with systemd though
2021-07-19 11:45:31	hingoanashi1209	[04:22:58] oh I would have erased that part from my memory too if I could have rascul
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[[R]]	[04:23:00] no one said it woudln't work
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:23:01] yeah, I'm not saying a systemd timer would not be ok ...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	rascul	[04:23:11] i do prefer the timers
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[[R]]	[04:23:13] just that it would be better to do it the corret way
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:23:48] Psi-Jack> I said cron was the wrong tool from the START
2021-07-19 11:45:31	ginger-fox	[04:23:52] msg nickserv identify password123
2021-07-19 11:45:31	akoana	[04:24:13] Psi-Jack> And it's going to continue to not be working.

2021-07-19 11:45:32	madprops	[05:04:12] hmm
2021-07-19 11:45:32	sheep	[05:04:18] you could also switch to using pushd/popd/dirs

2021-07-19 11:45:32	[[R]]	[05:05:03] you can't just tell us?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	madprops	[05:05:12] yeah basically it remembers location you visit
2021-07-19 11:45:32	madprops	[05:05:17] so you can do "z somelocation"
2021-07-19 11:45:32	madprops	[05:05:23] but it's not very accurate
2021-07-19 11:45:32	[[R]]	[05:05:32] "accurate"?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	madprops	[05:05:41] yeah it won't go anywhere often
2021-07-19 11:45:32	[[R]]	[05:05:46] huh?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	madprops	[05:06:08] or go to undesired locations

2021-07-19 11:45:32	rud0lf	[05:09:01] newbie in bash scripting here...
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:13:09] rud0lf, if you are planning to use the script personally, use a sane scripting instead of bash like fish or tcl.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	rud0lf	[05:13:32] but i want it as a practice
2021-07-19 11:45:32	rud0lf	[05:14:24] hm fixed it with "$(...)"
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:15:06] for the expression above, you should look into awk
2021-07-19 11:45:32	[[R]]	[05:15:27] tcl... sane...
2021-07-19 11:45:32	[[R]]	[05:15:28] HAHA

2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:38:18] hey im kinda noob to linux. which one of these am i supposed to download
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:40:37] If you have any of those distro then download the specific version. If not then the AppImage one would run on any distro.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:41:38] i think im debian
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:42:12] [[R]], I think tcl is a beautiful and timeless language.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:44:23] I don't know what CPU-X is, but you can download and install the Debian one. You might have to extract and there should be a binary file that you can run.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:45:44] Or better yet, just download the AppImage version and if you have KDE, then the Plasma will integrate it into the desktop in the first run. You don't have create .desktop file manually and place them.

2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:49:25] Right click the AppImage file, click Properties, go to the Permissions tab and check the Execute: Allow executing file as program.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:49:27] i got it working
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:49:37] all i had to do was run the debian command
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:49:48] Debian (since version 11 "Bullseye"): apt install cpu-x
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:50:25] You should check your repository first before looking elsewhere.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	reapear	[05:51:04] AppImage vs snap vs flatpak
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:51:24] yeh nothing in repo
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:51:30] maybe linux mint is just shit
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:51:39] whats a very n00b friendly distro
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:51:54] Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/38c3e2e8a7db623142ea687ddb0c0717/image.png

2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:52:11] Wait, if it wasn't in the repo, then how did `apt install cpu-x` work?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:52:14] second one is duplicate, ignore
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:52:25] astronaut thats a fabulous question
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:52:27] aaaand
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:52:29] I dont know
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:52:40] it was in your repo.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[05:52:52] so you are running some fancy program for info you could cat from proc filesystem in seconds
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:52:54] lets have another look
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:53:02] do something like `apt search cpu-x`, evilscreww
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:53:19] im not very apt at this whole thing
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:53:20] heh
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[05:53:37] and you cannot get that graphical nonsense working, so you blame distros
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[05:53:53] and mint is really beginner friendly
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:54:09] tbh its easier to type one 3 word syntax line
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:54:22] pasiz, he is probably running Linux Mint Debian Edition
2021-07-19 11:45:32	BobbyJr	[05:54:23] Just a random FYI, CPU-X shows up in the standard repos on Ubuntu 20.04
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:54:23] then all this extraction then searching for the right bin file bullshit
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:54:30] and then having to do several terminal commands nayway
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[05:55:06] yes, it's also on debian

2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:55:30] okay now its showing
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:55:33] for some reason it wasnt there before

2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[05:55:58] heres my basic bitch
2021-07-19 11:45:32	bob_x1	[05:56:04] what is the easiest way to host static website today ?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	bob_x1	[05:56:08] clouldflare ?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[05:56:37] bob_x1: digitalocean, hezner, depends where you need it located
2021-07-19 11:45:32	bob_x1	[05:56:49] pasiz: just web page without any backend
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[05:57:04] bob_x1, wordpress or github pages
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[05:57:20] bob_x1: yes, it's really cheap on hezner
2021-07-19 11:45:32	bob_x1	[05:57:35] ok
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[05:57:47] https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[05:58:36] do you need it for long time?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	bob_x1	[06:00:38] pasiz: just for one client to host my progress
2021-07-19 11:45:32	bob_x1	[06:00:55] maybe for future it will stay there .but at moment just easy to deploy. going to use some kind of static website generator
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:00:57] yer fwiw cpu-x is a great program. especially if you're thinking about selling your current machine
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:02:19] bob_x1: i use hezner, they have also cheap vps hosting and cloud
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:03:51] also. since im here
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:03:57] is there one command that will update the whole works
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:04:00] my apps, system, everything
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:04:10] im assuming libra office is an app btw
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:04:45] sudo apt full-upgrade

2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:05:08] before that sudo apt update, to update repository
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:05:30] thanks
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:05:33] yes, you have cpu-x package on apt tree
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:05:50] interesting
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:05:53] who would've thought
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:06:01] if it were up to me every good app would be in all the main repos
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:06:15] and they'd be compatible with linux mint
2021-07-19 11:45:32	kirk781	[06:06:26] My system is transferring tons of data; nearly a whole GB now; even though I've no processes open, and nothing is either streaming or torrenting or any kind of foreground internet activity
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[06:06:38] evilscreww, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2021-07-19 11:45:32	themachine	[06:06:46] that would mean that YOU PERSONALLY would have to package and maintain each of the various builds for the various distros evilscreww
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:06:50] also whats this business about "make install" ?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	kirk781	[06:06:59] Gnome system monitor shows the network speeds but is there any way to know which process/application is using this much data?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:07:05] themachine yer too much work
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:07:14] already have enough on my plate atm lel
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:07:22] evilscreww: i think you are searching basic usage from too far
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:07:41] but you could "man make" to gather information
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:07:44] could you rephrase that
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[06:07:56] evilscreww, make install is for building from the source and placing in the proper place for your system to find it
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:07:57] or "man man" to gather information of manual system in linux
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:08:15] before that you need to compile
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:08:42] riight
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:08:51] it's quite rare nowadays that you need to build from source
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:09:19] but manual system is really good on linux
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:10:27] you gotta admit though. some commands are funny. like "man man" man
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:11:09] no, you use man <command> to gather manual for that, you could also see manual for manual system
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:11:17] it's nothing funnhy
2021-07-19 11:45:32	loganlee	[06:11:55] is freenode still operational?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	loganlee	[06:12:18] that's a massive migration to libera
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[06:12:39] who cares about freenode, let that fagget burn that shit down
2021-07-19 11:45:32	loganlee	[06:13:02] i found my account is erased... i can't identify with nickserv
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:13:13] wait, it was **one person** who caused all this grief?
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:13:32] loganlee: last week i checked, it is operational, but all real discussion are gone....
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[06:14:02] evilscreww, some rags to riches fagget. he literally turned from a plebian to a prince.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	kubast2	[06:14:08] evilscreww, yeah because some guy got into ownership of freenode inc. but not the network
2021-07-19 11:45:32	kubast2	[06:14:13] so he has the domain now
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:14:19] so is man related to "read the man"
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:14:29] evilscreww: yes
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:14:35] thanks man.
2021-07-19 11:45:32	pasiz	[06:14:46] if you don't know like how to use mkdir, just "man mkdir"
2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:14:51] kubast2 oh lord

2021-07-19 11:45:32	evilscreww	[06:15:27] sorry i gotta change every command into something funny else i wont remember it
2021-07-19 11:45:32	astronaut	[06:15:28] evilscreww, RTFM stands for the read the full manual that gets thrown around here a lot

2021-07-19 11:47:38	evilscreww	i thought freenode was a network
2021-07-19 11:47:57	evilscreww	was this guy butt-hurt about some ban he received so he decided to buy the whole thing out and take over and enforce his own views

2021-07-19 11:48:18	astronaut	evilscreww, why do you think so. I am quite literally the opposite. I believe that though capitalism has it's flaws, no other economic system pulls it's people out of poverty faster than capitalism. it may not be the best system, but it is the best we have.

2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:05:53] who would've thought
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:06:01] if it were up to me every good app would be in all the main repos
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:06:15] and they'd be compatible with linux mint
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kirk781	[06:06:26] My system is transferring tons of data; nearly a whole GB now; even though I've no processes open, and nothing is either streaming or torrenting or any kind of foreground internet activity
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:06:38] evilscreww, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2021-07-19 18:40:03	themachine	[06:06:46] that would mean that YOU PERSONALLY would have to package and maintain each of the various builds for the various distros evilscreww
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:06:50] also whats this business about "make install" ?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kirk781	[06:06:59] Gnome system monitor shows the network speeds but is there any way to know which process/application is using this much data?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:07:05] themachine yer too much work
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:07:14] already have enough on my plate atm lel
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:07:22] evilscreww: i think you are searching basic usage from too far
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:07:41] but you could "man make" to gather information
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:07:44] could you rephrase that
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:07:56] evilscreww, make install is for building from the source and placing in the proper place for your system to find it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:07:57] or "man man" to gather information of manual system in linux
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:08:15] before that you need to compile
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:08:42] riight
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:08:51] it's quite rare nowadays that you need to build from source
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:09:19] but manual system is really good on linux
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:10:27] you gotta admit though. some commands are funny. like "man man" man
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:11:09] no, you use man <command> to gather manual for that, you could also see manual for manual system
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:11:17] it's nothing funnhy
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:11:55] is freenode still operational?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:12:18] that's a massive migration to libera
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:12:39] who cares about freenode, let that fagget burn that shit down
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:13:02] i found my account is erased... i can't identify with nickserv
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:13:13] wait, it was **one person** who caused all this grief?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:13:32] loganlee: last week i checked, it is operational, but all real discussion are gone....
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:14:02] evilscreww, some rags to riches fagget. he literally turned from a plebian to a prince.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kubast2	[06:14:08] evilscreww, yeah because some guy got into ownership of freenode inc. but not the network
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kubast2	[06:14:13] so he has the domain now
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:14:19] so is man related to "read the man"
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:14:29] evilscreww: yes
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:14:35] thanks man.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:14:46] if you don't know like how to use mkdir, just "man mkdir"
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:14:51] kubast2 oh lord

2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:15:27] sorry i gotta change every command into something funny else i wont remember it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:15:28] evilscreww, RTFM stands for the read the full manual that gets thrown around here a lot
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:15:38] sudo sounds like the phil collins song
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:15:44] su su sudio
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:16:10] why they erased my account at freenode?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:16:11] read the **whole entire manual* cover to cover just to get 1 program installed?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kirk781	[06:16:21] loganlee, they erased everyone's
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:16:23] not very n00b friendly
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:16:33] kirk781: what is the reason may i ask?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:16:40] astronaut are you anti capitalist?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kirk781	[06:17:04] loganlee, after transfership to Andrew Lee, the new formation decided to start from scratch and wiped everything for no reason
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:17:09] what does got into ownership of freenode but not the network mean
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:17:38] i thought freenode was a network
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:17:57] was this guy butt-hurt about some ban he received so he decided to buy the whole thing out and take over and enforce his own views
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:18:06] or was he just a rando commando from the street
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:18:18] evilscreww, why do you think so. I am quite literally the opposite. I believe that though capitalism has it's flaws, no other economic system pulls it's people out of poverty faster than capitalism. it may not be the best system, but it is the best we have.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kirk781	[06:19:10] Anyone on Rizon?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:19:31] that's a strange move by andrew lee because i won't go back to freenode just to sign up again
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:19:59] astronaut okay interesting
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:20:08] im not judging you just curious
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:21:07] guy was a member of freenode and overnight he found out he was related to some Corean royal and bam! he is a prince now. so guy decided to buy freenode and turn it into Facebook Messenger. failed miserable and is not trying to nuke it.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:21:38] it doesn't have alis
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:22:09] it just committed suicide
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:22:35] linux channel is still there
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:22:55] astronaut right
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:23:10] korean you mean
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:23:15] how much royality is over there btw?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:23:18] i thought north korea was poverty
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:23:24] south not so sure
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:23:27] north korea have kim jong
2021-07-19 18:40:03	pasiz	[06:23:52] i think they have own irc servers too ;)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[06:24:37] with a mandatory praise-kim-jong channel
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:25:15] fagget is a south corean clown prince. not north corea.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:26:40] got it. how annoying
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:27:09] is andrew lee here?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:27:34] evilscreww, the preferred spelling is Corea. But Japan being Japan, and in olympics they wanted to come before Corea in alphabetical list. And Japan having more sphere of influence started using Korea and now it is stuck, because JAPAN!!!
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:28:21] Japan and Korea needs to get some tanks first.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	loganlee	[06:28:27] maybe he is here reading things about him
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:28:33] I think we should start using Nippon so Corea comes first no matter what.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:29:33] hrm ive always seen it as korea on maps
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:29:40] i have a globe here as old as time and its spelt korea
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:30:09] the Libera community is going carve him a new one. everybody is pissed at him. he fragmented the entire community.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:31:10] evilscreww, https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-sep-15-fg-corea15-story.html
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:32:29] astronaut i certainly hope so too...
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:32:40] at least they added libera into the server list on kiwi irc
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:32:42] pretty quickly too
2021-07-19 18:40:03	BobbyJr	[06:33:40] It seems most of the major channels have already moved to Libera, so I think eventually freenode will vanish into obscurity
2021-07-19 18:40:03	BobbyJr	[06:34:00] especially after the recent 'lets delete everyones account for no reason' fiasco
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:35:00] shiting in the nest not a reason
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:35:02] Freenode aint going anyw fucking where.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	 *	iflema [06:35:40] deleted my own
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:36:37] autopsy, it may not be gone, it will be a ghost town. nothing interesting happening.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:36:50] Like hwats not interesting?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	BobbyJr	[06:36:59] astronaut: exactly
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:37:43] thank you for telling me the story btw
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:37:50] astronaut, what exactlky is not interesting happening there?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:37:54] i actually had no idea till now
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:38:13] and for me its a blessing in disguise because i had 5+ year old bans on freenode that no one was doing anything about
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:38:18] now i can rejoin those channels and behave myself
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:38:31] weak
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:38:34] evilscreww, wow thats sad really.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:38:46] Freenode is a communications platform.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:39:02] you'd think so
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:39:04] heaps of em
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:39:05] more like anti communication
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:39:05] We type to speak.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:39:09] some mods are dickbags let me tell you
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:39:20] Dick hoes in droves I see.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	evilscreww	[06:39:25] theyre slogan used to be "free speech isnt free on freenode" or something
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:39:46] Thats Rob Levin's shit anywyays.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:39:52] He founded freenode.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:40:00] It was his computers.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:40:22] Forget about libera and Freenode.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:40:42] autopsy, the burning down of freenode is interesting true. But nothing else. No organic discussions or anything, the entire purpose of IRC.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:41:00] This is between US Mexico South America Africa European Nations and Australia and Rob Levin and Andrew Leee and bagira and rasengan.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:41:49] China can run thier own server.net
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:42:39] Australians - culture: criminals
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:42:58] I agree with the man down under.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	autopsy	[06:43:37] iflema what the FUCK does that MEAN?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:44:53] just put that out there, i noticed Australia on your list
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:45:54] Australians are like upside down chilling out in the deserts with their pet kangaroos.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:46:13] in colour
2021-07-19 18:40:03	bewees	[06:46:14] What's a better option to structure synchronized/shared directories between multiple computers (using syncthing), option 1 or 2?: https://dpaste.com/G3Y86L4KC
2021-07-19 18:40:03	bewees	[06:47:34] I think option 1 might be safer, because the root directory makes it clear all files in that directory are explicitely shared, whereas the second option seems much more maintainable as you have just one directory and find stuff easier
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:51:26] astronaut: and wrestling crocs
2021-07-19 18:40:03	bewees	[06:52:36] I think the second option is the only way to do it right, because the structure of my filesystem shouldn't be dependent on how I share files, instead syncthing web interface can make it clear what is shared to whom/where
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:52:57] !next
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:54:05] why is it that anyone mentions Australia, the first thing that comes to my mind is Koala brothers.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:54:26] ?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:54:59] in planes?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[06:55:28] iflema, yeah.  https://youtu.be/PwMIcwtSqZo
2021-07-19 18:40:03	bewees	[06:55:41] The only difference is that with option 2 I will have to add way more shared directories, whereas with option 1 I would define only one shared directory in syncthing
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Sauvin	[06:55:50] First thing that came to my mind when somebody mentioned Australia was Claudia Black just now.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kirk781	[06:56:22] Emu War......
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iflema	[06:57:52] i had to run from one of them one day and jump into the next paddock and then had a bull running at me
2021-07-19 18:40:03	bewees	[06:57:59] So I think option 1 is better after all, make a clear separation to what files should be access by whom, because the number of files and directories outweigh the number of shared hosts
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:35:45] such silence!
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:40:07] esselfe, what is the wackomended amount of dedotated wam i should ave to serve?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Sauvin	[07:40:32] astronaut, use English.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:40:34] bibeli much
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Mekaneck	[07:40:46] astronaut: drunk?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:41:09] my system is top notch! Viva Linux!
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:41:47] Sauvin Mekaneck https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVNvSuA2mM
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Sauvin	[07:43:13] Congratulations. You've just linked a YT link to a person who can't understand speech easily (bad hearing) and the captions stink.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Mekaneck	[07:43:33] troll just another have we.... guess i
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:44:10] Sauvin, sorry. didn't know.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:44:18] I was just trolling
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Sauvin	[07:44:26] Heh.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	 *	esselfe [07:45:05] sprinkles peace flakes all over everyone
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:45:27] Linux made me happy often in my life
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Mekaneck	[07:45:37] told you so, yet another troll
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:45:59] no the channel is just idle
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:47:24] esselfe, linux makes computing so much fun and efficient
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:47:34] it's quite powerful yes
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:47:50] it can be dark though
2021-07-19 18:40:03	skeels	[07:48:21] yeah dark mode can be nice
2021-07-19 18:40:03	skeels	[07:48:32] my GNOME has that
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:49:01] for me the biggest appeal is plain text config files, ability to do almost anything command line which I can automate is what makes it fun.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	skeels	[07:49:36] you mean like DE customization?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:49:46] but sadly, with the advent of systemd-cancerd the plain text human readable config files are going away.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[07:50:06] so I keep on boycotting systemdisease
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:50:41] all of systemd's config files are plain text and human readable
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:50:49] it's called control freak :P
2021-07-19 18:40:03	skeels	[07:50:53] what's wrong with unit files?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[07:51:01] and of course desktop environment, for they are usually point-and-click customized
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:51:30] schillingklaus, it almost fell like a conspiracy propaganda how systemd cancer spread across linux community in so less time. as if someone was pumping money into it.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:51:50] even with so many vocal members being against it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[07:52:06] those are not really config files but input for a mechanism that updates a binary registry
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:52:20] a binary registry in RAM
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:52:30] which literally every other application that uses text configuration does
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:52:44] personally I adopted systemd. All that is bugging me is it doesn't reboot like I'd want to, it hangs instead
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[07:52:55] of course RedHat/IBM was pumping money into it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:53:35] systemd -- the story of how NSA successfully inserted a backdoor into a open source OS.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:53:47] how is systemd a backdoor?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	skeels	[07:54:02] it is open source, remove the backdoor and compile it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:54:08] also what about SELinux? that's actually by the NSA and is in the kernel
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:54:11] systemd is userspace
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[07:54:13] "A stop job is running for user session-c1.scope... (1d12h30m15s)"
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:54:29] the default timeout for those is 90 seconds
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:54:32] you can set it lower
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:54:40] and that's usually a sign of a hung user process
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:55:19] remember the backdoor that NSA put in Linux by using something as simple as if(user=root) { do this priviledged thing } with the source out in open.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:55:39] do you have a source for that?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:57:43] sheep, https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2013/10/09/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:58:30] that was 2003 and there's no ptoof that it was a deliberate attack
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:58:59] using = instead of == is a common error in writing C code
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[07:59:23] especially back in those days before gcc had good warnings and diagnostics
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[07:59:42] sheep, with binary configs the attack vector is HUGE as well as Pottering (you piece of shit) being stubborness and WONTFIX, systemd is a literal backdoor
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:00:03] how are text configs not a backdoor then?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:00:07] you're talking out of your ass
2021-07-19 18:40:03	iLinux-OS-User	[08:00:23] :')
2021-07-19 18:40:03	DPA	[08:00:35] It is quiet ironic that in systemd, which does so much dependency managemant and splits up service managemant to an atomic level, itself has bad overbroad libraries & interfaces, and bad dependencies between it's components.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[08:00:47] sheep, that = instead of == was not an honest mistake (like you said GCC warns about it). It was malicious.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:01:15] and besides that even if someone tried to backdoor it there are multiple distributions and third parties that would check changes to systemd to try to find such things and they would get patched out as soon as they were discovered
2021-07-19 18:40:03	HumbleGuy	[08:02:27] how to make LOGIN_TIMEOUT infinite in login.defs?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	DPA	[08:02:48] I would never write x == 0. Just write !x.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[08:03:27] sheep, it will not be patched and Pottering will just label WONTFIX and go suck NSA.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:03:58] astronaut: have fun being an idiot
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:04:20] HumbleGuy: the man page doesn't suggest that it can be infinite, but I'll see if I can find a source for what the accepted range of values is
2021-07-19 18:40:03	skeels	[08:04:30] i thought people didn't like systemd because it was too complex
2021-07-19 18:40:03	varaindemian	[08:04:31] trying to edit the sudoers file using `sudo visudo` and I added this line at the end of it: `oct ALL=NOPASSWD: /snap/bin/novnc --vnc localhost:5900`
2021-07-19 18:40:03	varaindemian	[08:04:38] now I get syntax error
2021-07-19 18:40:03	varaindemian	[08:04:45] >>> /etc/sudoers: syntax error near line 31 <<< What now?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	HumbleGuy	[08:06:07] sheep, any luck?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[08:06:14] sheep, systemd label a bug that could potentially brick your computer WONTFIX.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:06:20] HumbleGuy: it looks like it's typed as unsigned int so you could set it to 2^32-1
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:06:33] astronaut: distros will patch it themselves or fork it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:06:47] HumbleGuy: 4294967295
2021-07-19 18:40:03	HumbleGuy	[08:07:06] sheep, wow, thanks!
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:07:15] HumbleGuy: it's not infinite but it will last 68 years
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:08:00] HumbleGuy: it looks like it also accepts 0
2021-07-19 18:40:03	HumbleGuy	[08:08:01] sheep, fair enough
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[08:08:13] sheep, that is the principle that Pottering lives his life --- 'other people should clean my shit'. Let the distro maintainers fix it. Let the community fix my PulseAudio shit.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	varaindemian	[08:08:22] anyone?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:08:33] varaindemian: I think it's rather "oct ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ..."
2021-07-19 18:40:03	HumbleGuy	[08:09:04] sheep, what will 0 do?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	HumbleGuy	[08:09:08] disable it?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:09:11] HumbleGuy: no timeout; wait forever
2021-07-19 18:40:03	HumbleGuy	[08:09:26] oh, i think that's better
2021-07-19 18:40:03	varaindemian	[08:09:38] esselfe syntax error again
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:09:45] assuming I'm reading the code for shadow-maint's login right and that's the one you're using
2021-07-19 18:40:03	sheep	[08:09:58] https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/blob/f9831a4a1a20b0e8fe47cc72ec20018ec04dbb90/src/login.c#L719
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:10:15] varaindemian: oh I know you can't give parameters, ust absolute executable names
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:10:22] just*
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:11:02] varaindemian: if you want to limit certain parameters put the line 'vnc --...' in a script and have that script NOPASSWD
2021-07-19 18:40:03	varaindemian	[08:11:25] esselfe let's try that. thanks!
2021-07-19 18:40:03	TJ-	[08:14:11] esselfe: command parameters are allowed
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:33:52] from https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.15/sudoers.man.html "A simple file name allows the user to run the command with any arguments he/she wishes. However, you may also specify command line arguments (including wildcards). Alternately, you can specify "" to indicate that the command may only be run without command line arguments." good to know
2021-07-19 18:40:03	DPA	[08:34:44] > Note that the following characters must be escaped with a ‘\’ if they are used in command arguments: ‘,’, ‘:’, ‘=’, ‘\’.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	DPA	[08:34:44] So the \: has to be escaped.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:35:31] man tightvnc server refuses to start, it says "failed to set default font path '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/,/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/' Fatal server error: could not open default font 'fixed'"
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:36:38] I have all the X11 fonts installed
2021-07-19 18:40:03	DPA	[08:38:44] There is another thing to look out for with sudo. If you specify the allowed arguments, the user can add anything after that.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:39:15] need -- at the end?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	programmar	[08:51:51] wondering a bit about security, i mean at this moment of 22:27 in this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozmHeApuSj8&ab_channel=IppSec, what exactly did he did there and why ? i don't see any reason that he couldn't just directly use the current shell ?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	programmar	[08:52:12] i didn't really hear it clear tho so if someone could explains, i would be appreciate :P
2021-07-19 18:40:03	programmar	[08:53:45] whoops i mean 22:23
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Pentode	[08:53:46] esselfe: most modern distros have bitmap fonts disabled since they dont jive with modern versions of GTK+. that could be why it refuses to start.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:58:08] how would I enable them?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[08:58:30] I have xbitmaps and bitmap installed
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Pentode	[08:59:30] can't remember exactly but you have to do something in /etc/fonts/conf.d/
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[09:00:01] ok I search with google, thanks
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Pentode	[09:00:03] there is a conf file named no-bitmap or something like that you have to edit
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:11:18] it's modern pango that can be an issue, specifically. it doesn't like bitmap fonts unless they are in otb format.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kubast2	[09:16:54] How can I print a 1st column of a file? "0x20" seperator(I think)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kubast2	[09:17:01] awk doesn't work since 2020
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kubast2	[09:17:07] for that purpose
2021-07-19 18:40:03	DLange	[09:17:42] cut -d " " -f 1
2021-07-19 18:40:03	esselfe	[09:21:01] awk '{ print $1 }'
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kubast2	[09:22:37] esselfe, yeah the awk method doesn't work for me anymore since 2020, DLange thanks worked flawlessly
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Str1x	[09:23:28] I'm working on a java service that runs on linux. when I ssh into a linux machine, I can see the service running with 'top', but i don't know how to access the java console over ssh, like on main machine, is that even possible?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:25:49] Str1x you mean access the console of the user running the java application?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Str1x	[09:26:18] fleco, Yes
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:27:02] Str1x do a ps aux, note the username in the most left
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:27:58] to login with that user you must know the password, or you can get root and su - username
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Str1x	[09:32:14] i did login as that user, however i cant access the runnin application
2021-07-19 18:40:03	phogg	[09:32:18] "java console" on Windows is usually a pop-up pseudo-terminal window that shows the stdout and stderr of the process as it runs.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:33:09] Str1x: if the process doesn't have a controlling terminal, with the TTY field not referencing a discernible tty, there is no "console".
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:33:14] I not sure how to proceed with this
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:33:30] Str1x: and, in that case, there would surely be some logging system in use. at least, I would hope so.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	phogg	[09:34:16] Str1x: see if you have a dir called ~/.java/deployment/log/ for the user who is running the java program. That should be where console output gets logged, if it gets logged anywhere.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Str1x	[09:35:16] I think i didnt formulate my question right,  sorry for that. When i ran the application on machine, in terminal i can pass it different commands, but when i ssh into the machine, i see a regular terminal, but not the running application "console"
2021-07-19 18:40:03	geirha	[09:35:22] if you have and X server running locally, and ssh in with X11-forwarding, you should be able to run jconsole remotely with the gui displayed locally
2021-07-19 18:40:03	phogg	[09:35:23] in all probability this is another "you should have run it in screen"
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:35:41] Str1x: so, use a terminal multiplexer to launch the program in the first place (tmux, screen)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	phogg	[09:36:05] Str1x: there is approximately no way to fix this after the program has started
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:36:27] Can I boot to a linux live cd on a macbook? If yes, can I then do ATA SECURE ERASE or some other discard operation on the SSD? Lastly, is it then possible to fresh install the MacOS?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:36:40] I want to erase all data on a macbook before I sell it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:36:53] on a linux laptop it would be trivial
2021-07-19 18:40:03	phogg	[09:36:57] Str1x: but see also reptyr, then maybe you can do it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:36:58] but I've never done this on a macbook
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Str1x	[09:37:04] I think curdlesnoot gave me a good way to do it, i will just have to reRun the app with a tmux or screen
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:37:18] xx: yes.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:37:19] xx yes
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:37:38] xx: if nothing else, blkdiscard can be used. ata secure erase _might_ work, as long as it's not an nvme drive.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Str1x	[09:37:57] <3 thanks everyone
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:38:07] yeah, I was hoping to use hdparm to see if ata secure erase would work, and if not then blkdiscard
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[09:38:07] curdlesnoot: what happens with a nvme drive?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:38:18] akik: nvme drives don't support ata secure erase
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:38:26] akik: it requires some other protocol to perform the equivalent. I haven't tried it yet.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:38:46] akik: I just copped out and used blkdiscard the last time.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:38:50] reduce disk space to bare minimum and then fill a big file with random data
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:38:56] delete, maybe do again
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:39:01] till disk was full
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:39:05] clemens3: that takes a long time, and reduces lifespan of ssd
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:39:17] you only do once or twice and you sell it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:39:36] selling it wasn't the goal.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:39:38] anyway, in the end you have to write something into it, diy or tool
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:39:44] I'm happy as long as the drive appears full of zeros, and then has a fresh mac os installed on it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:39:56] at least, not the stated goal. maybe it is.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:40:18] "I want to erase all data on a macbook before I sell it"
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:40:27] oh. my mistake then. missed that.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[09:41:01] aren't those data encrypted?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:41:09] some dd command from /dev/urandom into file
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:41:14] fill whole disk..
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:41:32] schillingklaus: in the case of macOS, you have to opt in to FDE.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:41:35] after you deleted your stuff
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:42:00] with ssd you have no idea which cells are used, so you have to erase everything
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[09:42:15] once is enough
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:43:25] clemens3: I'm happy with a simple discard or ata secure erase
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:43:28] akik xx: as far as nvme is concerned: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive/Memory_cell_clearing#NVMe_drive.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[09:45:53] Hello, is kernel module unloading widely used? I've heard that you should avoid unloadig kernel modules, because it might harm the system. Is that true?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:46:19] justas: it's technically possible, yes.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[09:46:33] but is it safe or should I avoid doing it?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:47:17] it is usually safe
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:47:33] it might be or it might not be. there is so much entropy involved here, one could not guess. it's probably OK in most cases, but I would tend to avoid it unless there's a good cause.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:48:32] at least, for any system where casual rebooting is not a convenient option.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:49:56] in my xp, modules that controls hardware are more likely to have issues
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:49:56] unloading some netfilter xtables modules is different from, say, unloading a low-level device driver.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[09:50:01] ok, thank you very much
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:50:09] yeah
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[09:50:46] if it controls hardware, and the machine is in production, probably best avoided.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:51:02] yes
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[09:52:19] felco: xp? win xp?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:52:30] oh Sauvin must be afk haha
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:52:41] ok ok, in experience!
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:52:45] my*
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[09:53:04] do I need some special linux live cd to boot on macbook, or does any work?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:53:31] if theres a windows version I hated most, that is windows xp
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:53:53] xx ubuntu usually boots ok
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Sauvin	[09:54:47] That's "away from keyboard", you semiliterate CHIMP!
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[09:54:54] HAHAHAH!
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[09:55:31] i hate windows 10 the most
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[09:58:14] windows11 is even worse, and win 12 will be worse than that, and on and on and on it goes
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Revelator	[09:59:49] Win10 is... meh, it functions for the most part, haven't tried out Win11 (not that I will either)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[10:03:28] win10 requires 40GB to do what I do in 600MB
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:08:10] xx I could put it another way, there is 39.4GB of useless code in Windows =]
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:09:02] That is actually something to think about...
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[10:09:06] useless for my purposes, yes
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[10:09:19] and windows is all-or-nothing design
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[10:12:08] gnome is also all or nothing design
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[10:12:19] maybe after win 11 comes out they push for a cloud os.. like sun tried back in the day.. being win11 all the argument for a thin client:)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[10:12:40] i hope they don't push everyone just in the direction of chromeos
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:12:53] schillingklaus but you can strip gnome, while on windows you can't really strip anything from the main system
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[10:13:17] all stuff coming from red hat have been garbage and wrong direction
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:13:26] clemens3 ms is already on that move, they just launched windows 365
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[10:13:36] because all paid developers without passion and heart
2021-07-19 18:40:03	lasks[m]	[10:13:46] what is the worst case scenario for using firejail or bubblewrap?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	clemens3	[10:14:00] felco.. yeah.. seems win11 is the anvil for that strategy
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[10:14:18] lasks[m]: your computer burns
2021-07-19 18:40:03	lasks[m]	[10:14:54] get serious, I am not here for roasting myself
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[10:16:42] lasks falls into a burning jail of fire, he goes down down down and the flames grow higher
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:16:55] lasks[m] I never had any issue with firejail, what is you worried about?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[10:17:13] lasks[m]: it's better to run a browser with firejail, and not without it but i'm not sure what you want
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[10:18:19] i hope it is not just a dirty and cheap attempt at imitating FreeBSD jails
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:18:41] oh well haha
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:18:50] all we do is copy
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:19:06] some improvement, maybe
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:19:32] a new approach, may happen on the way
2021-07-19 18:40:03	tonitch	[10:22:21] Hey, I just tried to add a hdd to my fstab that I want to be usable by my user and I can mount it whit the normal line but it make me this error when I try to add gid and uid

2021-07-19 18:40:03	tonitch	[10:25:38] ho yhea, you are right
2021-07-19 18:40:03	tonitch	[10:25:45] but why is uid and gid usefull then ?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[10:26:10] tonitch: they're not in that config file
2021-07-19 18:40:03	tonitch	[10:26:11] ok, nvm it depends on the fs
2021-07-19 18:40:03	felco	[10:26:33] in ntfs you don't have the usual permissions, so you can 'fix' it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[10:33:05] oh yea. i meant those options don't belong there for ext4

2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:13:59] grml does not boot on the macbook
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:14:12] or at least the 'hold Alt while powering on' does not list the usb stick as an option
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:14:19] what should I try next?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[12:15:10] xx: I used Arch media, for what it's worth.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[12:15:29] xx: the font was miniscule on a Retina display but it worked.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:15:48] so, SystemRescueCd https://www.system-rescue.org/ should work?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:15:52] it's arch-based
2021-07-19 18:40:03	curdlesnoot	[12:15:53] probably
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:18:08] I find so few online results of people booting linux live cd on a macbook...
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:23:59] That's mostly because people with a MacBook, don't want Linux on them.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[12:24:38] can linux run in a vm under osx?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:24:47] Of coruse.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:24:52] course*
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:24:59] and it's no longer osx, but macOS.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	greatcoof	[12:25:09] what's a good way i can copy my artix install without everything breaking apart
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[12:25:15] why is osx outlawed?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:25:27] schillingklaus: It's no longer 10.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:25:38] Big Sur is 11.x
2021-07-19 18:40:03	schillingklaus	[12:26:00] ahhhh
2021-07-19 18:40:03	greatcoof	[12:26:04] ma.cos
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:26:26] And it was technically, before, Mac OS X.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:26:28] Can iw create a vap interface as a slave? Right now it seems to create the interface as a master. In WEXT days it was created as a slave 9(eg. ath0@wifi0), currently it's only ath0.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:26:41] vap?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:26:47] virtual AP
2021-07-19 18:40:03	greatcoof	[12:26:56] *wap
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:27:15] Not likely no.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	greatcoof	[12:27:20] *wet AP
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:27:22] well basically the question would be: does iw handle this or is this wifi driver's job?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:27:33] neither.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:28:30] is there a way then to find the master interface? For example I create ath0 under wifi0, how do I find out in code that ath0 belogs to wifi0?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:28:34] ath0 also doesn't look like a Linux interface name at all.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:28:53] it's embedded linux
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:28:59] and a proprietary driver
2021-07-19 18:40:03	 *	greatcoof [12:30:35] wonders if anyone will answer his question
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:32:14] sys/devices/virtual/net/ath0/parent
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:32:25] found it
2021-07-19 18:40:03	justas	[12:32:38] now I got to get that info through netlink somehow :/
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:34:32] SystemRescueCd does not boot on the macbook either
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:34:40] it does not show in the boot options
2021-07-19 18:40:03	TomyWork	[12:36:46] we have a 1 GB file that our CI builds regularly. that file is a .zip file containing a bunch of .jar files (which are basically .zip files). between builds, barely anything changes, but due to compression, regular binary diff isn't as efficient as it could be. Is there some advanced, recursively zip-aware binary diff or something like that? :)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:39:26] what are my options now?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:40:00] Hey all. Quick question. I'm trying to delete a bunch of directories with different suffixes but the following isn't working - any suggestions? rm -rf /home/alpaca/testdir.* nor is rm -rf /home/alpaca/testdir.[1-10]*
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:40:24] Does the fact that there is a period in the directory name mess it up?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:41:57] here is maybe a silly idea but is it possible to use a tar as you would a filesystem? like maybe be able to "mount" a tar file and then have it transparent as you would any other filesystem?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:42:46] the reason i thought about this is because in a tar the permissions are store for all the files and if you could do this you could just simply store the tar on a filesystem that doesn't support linux permissions for files
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:43:02] like ntfs for example
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:43:56] xx: What is it you're actually trying to do.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:44:49] aRogueAlpaca: `ls -lad /home/alpaca/testdir.*`
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:45:16] Psi-Jack, to the man pages I go! Thanks
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[12:45:18] he is trying to mount an ISO file, except that it is a TAR instead of ISO.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:45:23] aRogueAlpaca: What?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:46:05] aRogueAlpaca: Need information. You said rm doesn't work, paste the results of the ls output to termbin (see /topic)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:46:26] astronaut: do you meen my thing?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:47:02] Psi-Jack, Oh ha. My bad, I thought you were givin me an answer and I was going to go look it up thinking that ls had some option to delete with it. As of right now, the directories are all empty
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:47:17] i just found out about archivemount so that is cool
2021-07-19 18:40:03	astronaut	[12:47:20] yes Daulity i thought Psi-Jack was replying to you.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:48:04] aRogueAlpaca: d just shows directories, not traverses into the directories. Need to see output provided by said command.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:49:23] Psi-Jack: boot linux live cd on a macbook
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:49:25] any live cd
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:49:27] astronaut: i see ISO is another way of achieving that i see :)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:49:33] xx: Is there a purpose for this?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:49:40] Well it was more of a curiousity :)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:49:47] Psi-Jack: to do ata secure erase, or blkdiscard, or the nvme sanitize on the drive
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:50:00] xx: Is there a purpose for this as well?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:50:17] Psi-Jack: so that I can resell the device with confidence that none of my data remains
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:50:32] Psi-Jack, https://hastebin.com/azowihefih.apache
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:50:36] Or I can paste here
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:50:48] https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-to-wipe-a-mac-hard-drive/
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:50:56] xx: There's native ways to do what you're asking.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:51:02] Psi-Jack: no there aren't
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:51:09] I just provided you one, yes there is.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:51:17] that's for external drives
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:51:40] and none of that discards the used blocks properly
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:51:55] The Security Options window includes a slider that enables you to determine how thoroughly you want to erase your hard drive.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:52:00] You're incorrect.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[12:52:35] Psi-Jack: since this is a #linux channel, I am asking how to boot a linux live cd, what I do afterwards is none of your business, thank you
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:53:11] You're using non-standard hardware for Linux, just to do what the non-standard hardware actually has immediately available to it.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:53:19] I mean, Get a clue.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:54:10] Psi-Jack, all good. I wasn't being overly clear in that I was using the python subprocess module to run this. When I tried in the shell, there was a typo. Didn't realize that the shell expands the pattern while in python I have to explicitly give rm a list.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:54:22] heh
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:54:31] aRogueAlpaca: Yep. That's a huuuuuuge difference.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:54:59] Psi-Jack, yep. Just woke up :/\
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:55:06] Also, you shouldn't need to be using subprocess calls for that either.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:55:13] How so?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:55:15] You should be using python functions designed for the task.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	[jamez]	[12:55:16] lol. I haven't heard anybody say "get a clue" in years.  That's great :D
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:55:35] Python has libraries for that and build in utilities
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:55:56] shutil.rmtree('/path/to/your/dir/')
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:56:02] From shutil.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	aRogueAlpaca	[12:56:46] Psi-Jack, Sweet. Will take a gander, thanks
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:56:52] Welcome. 🙂
2021-07-19 18:40:03	DPA	[12:57:22] Don't some macs have parts of their bios / firmware on the internal hdd? So if those are fully wiped, doesn't that brick them / make installing anything on them impossible?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:57:31] 9:10 times, when you're using a shell command to do something in a programming language, likely there's a better way within the programming language itself.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Daulity	[12:58:22] DPA: oof that's not fair lol
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:58:26] DPA: No. Thei have Open Firmware.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[12:58:43] Open Firmware is accessed on startup and provides you with an interface for technical diagnostics and debugging your computer.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:01:35] You can, unlike BIOS/UEFI systems alone, fully /AND/ securely wipe a disk properly, and reinstall an OS, all from the Command+R boot sequence, provided of course you made yourself an installation disc, or have it on Time Machine.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:02:23] Having adopted more into Apple computers myself at home as of late, I've come to appreciate this, and only used it to see that it is there, when I need it, if I need it,.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:02:59] That, and I've had friends bring me their older MacBook's for me to look at. I've used Mac's for work computers, company issued, etc.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	kubast2	[13:04:04] Is it possible to use getenv() with a wildcard/NULL to grab all env variables?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:04:18] I do kind of miss the one company I worked at that issued full Mac Pro's for everyone in the development department that I was in. The Mac Pro's that looked all aluminum, and looked like they had 4 handles, one on each corner.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[13:04:23] apple also has internet recovery
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:04:35] akik: Oh? Does it really?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[13:04:45] Psi-Jack: i just said the have :)
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:05:09] So no disc is even required, because it's Apple hardware, it can download the OS from the internet?
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:05:16] If you want a clean slate, of course.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	xx	[13:06:05] DPA: it's fine, because the macOS installer can install to a fully blank hard drive
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[13:06:11] Psi-Jack: although for my 2011 imac it didn't offer the latest version but os x lion
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:06:47] akik: We’ll latest sported for the model in question.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	akik	[13:07:09] Psi-Jack: 2011 imac support high sierra
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:07:24] I’m trying to consider which I’m going to get in what order. Newest iPad Pro, or M1 MBA.
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:08:06] I have the last Intel MBP 16”
2021-07-19 18:40:03	Psi-Jack	[13:08:24] But only there 1st Gen iPad Pro 10”

2021-07-19 18:49:43	slackadelic	Psi-Jack: I can SEE the point, sort of...keeping apps away from each other...but it also makes managing those apps a pain

2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:42:29] well, my VGA cable just broke
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:42:46] https://termbin.com/thny if someone is interested in `xrandr --prop` on my laptop
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[22:43:26] look at all those supported colorspaces
2021-07-20 10:40:20	jim	[22:43:33] wasjust about to ask him to do that
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:43:36] coerce "Broadcast RGB" to "Limited 16:235" as a starting point. that's typically what an LCD TV expects after agreeing to accept RGB over HDMI, prior to any fiddling with the settings.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:43:51] settings on the TV side, I mean.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:44:45] right now it's "Automatic", which means YPbPr is on the cards and I'll bet a nickel that's what's being used now.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:45:08] it's supposed to be "Full". Are you looking at the right screen?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:45:41] it's currently "Automatic". you should not use "Full" unless you are 100% positive your TV is in agreement.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:46:29] some LCD TVs don't even support it. if you mismatch the quantisation range, you can screw up the colour in brand new ways.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:46:45] HDMI-1 connected 1360x768+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 1150mm x 650mm
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:46:46] ...
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:46:46] 	Broadcast RGB: Full
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:46:46] 		supported: Automatic, Full, Limited 16:235
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:47:09] oh yeah. sorry, was looking at the wrong port.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:47:18] curdlesnoot: I don't care it will screw up colors; at least it won't broke like some old tech
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:47:34] yes, well it can't possibly do any damage.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:47:44] anyway, give Limited a go.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[22:48:09] jim why should i learn python over C?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:48:11] done
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[22:48:14] the screen blinked
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:48:16] TheWild: try them all. if nothing looks good, poke around in your TV settings and see if there's a way to instruct the TV as the the colourspace/range it should expect on a given port.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:48:27] TheWild: I know how to do this for modern-ish Sony TVs only.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:49:18] HDMI is supposed to auto-negotiate for "automatic" but it only takes one of the devices to have other plans.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:50:42] also, there's a chart you can use to check whether the rgb quantisation level is properly in agreement but that's probably premature at this stage.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[22:54:31] there's some background information on this topic here: http://junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php?title=XRGB-mini_FRAMEMEISTER#HDMI_Set_.E2.86.92_Output_Range
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[23:00:41] I've been playing with some settings and the screen blinks, but it seems like the TV is ignoring pretty much everything.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[23:01:15] so, even "Automatic" is bad?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[23:02:31] yup
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[23:02:40] then I think your options are to get to the bottom of the TV settings (if there even are any that are relevant) or get a new VGA cable.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[23:03:04] heh
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[23:03:04] it has a service RS-232 port :D
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[23:08:27] ok, I gonna grab the VGA cable from the office and see how it works out.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheWild	[23:08:27] curdlesnoot: thanks for support
2021-07-20 10:40:20	jim	[23:18:45] byte4byte_, maybe you should learn something like python, perl or lua (there's more to this list), one purpose, to prototype apps you'd do a more robust/complete version in c or c++. WORD OF WARNING... I've been getting complaints, and I have carte blanche to do whatever. so, TAKE CARE OF YOUR BEHAVIOR. Otherwise, you could be gone from here for a very long time.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	jim	[23:20:48] byte4byte_, another thing, python/perl/lua have very extensive addon libs, which you might look into, to see if you can use one or more libs in those.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:21:31] LUA me alone :P
2021-07-20 10:40:20	jim	[23:22:02] I heard lua is very fast
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:23:04] its easier to read than perl but python has more points for me
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:23:53] i think kpie (the successor of devilspie 1 and 2) was written in lua
2021-07-20 10:40:20	jim	[23:29:07] also, those languages have an object system, and have fully internalized all the allocation/freeing of objects in that system
2021-07-20 10:40:20	jim	[23:29:31] (aka: you don't have to deal with it)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:38:19] jim what complaints have you heard the use of the word "nerd"?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:38:24] how is that negative?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:38:45] and if i cant use the word nerd why dont people have to call me anything i please?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:38:59] its a 2 way street
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[23:39:03] byte4byte_: your website su@$s
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:39:47] lawyering, not two way street
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:40:26] byte4byte_: a nerd is a derogative terminus
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:40:53] i dont thin knerd is derogative
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:41:00] but most others do
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:41:16] i get offended when people dont call me king
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:41:22] does that mean they have to call me king?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:41:29] in your channel, yes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	MrMobius	[23:45:21] if i want to log in, start a program crunching some numbers, then log out and come back a few days later, is there a better way than something like tmux?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:45:47] better in what way
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:47:10] if you have an interactive terminal program and you want to log out and come back to it later, then no, tmux or screen are where it's at.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:48:00] so jim can you add "no usage of word nerd & must call byte4byte king" in the topic?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:48:15] if it's not interactive, you can redirect its output to a file and run it in the background
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[23:48:37] or simply "the word nerd can be used"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:48:53] or maybe say byebye to bytebyte
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:49:10] could somebody do something like "ssh user@host command_xy &"?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:49:25] yogoyo: alas, that would put the ssh session in the background
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:49:35] oops
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:49:48] i think
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:50:11] i need to construct a test program
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:51:42] doh, i have no vps at the moment and no sshd either
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[23:52:02] *shrug* we might as well wait to see if there's more info about the nature of the program
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:52:15] yup
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[23:53:03] it almost certainly won't do what you expect. now, ssh -n user@host 'command_xy >/dev/null 2>&1 &' will be closer to the mark.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[23:53:22] unless you really did mean to background ssh(1) instead.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[23:54:43] even in the latter case, ssh -f might be more appropriate.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:54:44] curdlesnoot: i wanted to test a simpler solution to screen and tmux
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[23:54:53] ok, so not the latter case.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[23:55:34] there are plenty of pitfalls. you should close fd 0, and send fd 1 and fd 2 elsewhere, as noted.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[23:56:00] otherewise, expect ssh(1) to dutifully wait regardless.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:56:54] why do i need the stderr redirect?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[23:58:05] let me type that into greg's tutorial search thingie

2021-07-20 10:40:20	 *	yogoyo [00:16:55] installs supertuxkart just in case
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[00:17:06] yogoyo: further, you want the sshd instance to actually exit.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:19:48] curdlesnoot: it would unnecessarily bind resources or would there be another problem when that sshd instance does not quit?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:20:28] with fedora i get a new kernel every 1-2 days. so i need to reboot anyways
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[00:21:13] yogoyo: as noted by the article, sshd will never observe eof.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:23:45] Hello People
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:25:09] curdlesnoot: what would you write as tag line for a todo list? "inter process communication" or something like that?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:25:52] Been reading some old PC mags; wow how things have changed. To start PC mags were a thing.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[00:26:23] yogoyo: you mean, as concerns this topic? yes, it falls under the issue of inter-process communication (not least, as pipes are involved).
2021-07-20 10:40:20	iflema	[00:26:40] blackgatonegro: yeah they had dvd on the cover
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:26:49] Installing Linux was an Oddisey, Windows wasn't spyware, and  so on.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:26:52] curdlesnoot: heh, and without the help of pipes?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[00:27:14] yogoyo: only in the loosest sense. but I would still say yes.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:27:48] iflema try floppies
2021-07-20 10:40:20	iflema	[00:28:10] I used to like mikes 10 billion distros in one dvd with menu
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:28:28] I still have a few old pc mags that cane with floppies; dunno were the heck the floppies ended.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:28:52] *came
2021-07-20 10:40:20	iflema	[00:28:59] blackgatonegro: 26 of em
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:29:23] floppies needed no "sync" like usb pendrives. you could follow the sound of the drive
2021-07-20 10:40:20	iflema	[00:29:29] i couldnt hadle floppies alway a few duds in the set
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:29:30] But mostly I remember when PC mags started to include CDs with demos and shareware, fub times.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	iflema	[00:29:41] speakers and microwaves and whatever
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:30:07] Nah back in the early 90s floppies actually were of good quality.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:30:45] They also weren't cheap.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:31:03] the 5,25" ones were bad
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:31:52] Actually flat floppies ended lasting me more for some reason, you just had to you know; be careful handling them.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[00:32:18] not all drives were manufactured equal, for that matter. I recall once testing a pile of floppy drives with a DOS utility whose name now escapes me.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:32:31] It was like handling something made of crystal, be slow and careful and they lasted a lot.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[00:32:39] it helped me select the one that was most reliably able to deal with novel formats.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:33:35] While I started with DOS by the time I had my own computer, it came with Windows 95 .
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:33:44] novel netware 3
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:34:19] 1 disk missing and you notice near the end of the installation
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:34:45] maybe thats where my head is gone missing
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:34:58] Ah yeah, the problem with installing big programs that came in several disks
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Sauvin	[00:35:07] blackgatonegro, the 3.5" floppies had higher densities, 3.5" drives had smaller RW heads, and the whole get-up was a lot more sensitive to bit rot.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:35:11] It was a pain.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:35:50] But before Win95 I usually used small stuff that fit in a single disk so I didn't have to deal with that much.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:37:14] 1 floppy was enough to fit several old DOS games like snake, and.. prehistoric I think?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	iflema	[00:37:32] i got in in 98  some folks couldnt figure out napster so i had a crack :S
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:37:59] :D
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:38:57] I remember Windows 98, such a pain. You literally had to reinstall it every few months, win98se was slightly better.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[00:39:45] the tun is tuna
2021-07-20 10:40:20	rascul	[00:40:26] https://www.wired.com/2009/05/five-disk-floppy-raid-4mb-of-blistering-fast-storage/
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:41:13] Anyway the first Linux I used ran inside Windows, it came in a PC mag CD and... at least it booted. Kinda rad for the year 1999.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	rascul	[00:41:46] loadlin.exe existed in 1999
2021-07-20 10:40:20	zjmc_	[00:42:13] cool diskette raid
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:43:32] Anyway I then got Linux on my second desktop in 2008... then after two weeks of dealing with 2008 CemtOs, got the tech guy to install me ubuntu instead.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kyv	[00:44:25] tonight on vh1's 'before they were stars'
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:44:49] Still keep using my win98 machine for years, cause games.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:47:01] And then Gnome 3 and Ubuntu Unity dss
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:47:09] desktop happened - -
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:47:10] esselfe: ever get that to work? just curious.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[00:49:46] blackgatonegro: may i ask you something via private message?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blackgatonegro	[00:49:58] Go ahead.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:51:30] I can't recall what :P
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:51:49] vnc?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:52:56] man you went far in the backlogs!
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:55:00] I had couple problems tonight
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:55:03] lmao sorry
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:55:10] yeah vnc
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:55:35] oh no, the vnc server works on my laptop but it fails on my tower
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:55:39] i just like to have an idea of what works in case anyone else asks a similar / same question s
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:56:00] still gives you that font error after enabling bitmap fonts?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:56:04] I took the one from realvnc since tightvnc (which they use) doesn't compile
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:56:12] ah
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:56:15] darn
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:56:22] yes, my distro dev say it's not the bitmap thing
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[00:56:40] Anyone here familiar with cameras?  I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to not do... well i think they are doing double encoding, no?  The stream from the camera is encoded, and then decoded by the dvr, and re-encoded... isnt there a way to just raw... well now as i type this i wonder if it can just upload to a share
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:56:55] hmm. i can't imagine what else it could be.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:56:58] he helped me getting it working with 'vncserver -fp /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc'
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:57:22] it's a pretty common issue with software that rely on x's older font infrastructure
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:57:32] fc-list reports lots of fixed fonts
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:57:34] ah
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:57:49] oh good
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[00:58:10] i know most distro's disable them now-a-days so i thought there was a good chance that was the problem
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:58:45] and weirdly /usr/share/fonts/X11 there's only OTF whilst on my laptop it's full of font dirs
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[00:59:06] all the fonts seem in /usr/share/fonts and that fails with -fp
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[01:00:38] look it's all there :) https://termbin.com/vh0k (fc-list | grep -i fixed)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[01:01:52] what does ls -l /etc/fonts/conf.d | grep bitmap look like on either machine?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[01:02:04] yall know if there is a software that will warp a video from fisheye to a specific shape?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[01:02:28] there camera has softawre that lets you view realtime that way but it doesnt actually save video that way
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[01:03:08] tower: https://termbin.com/p11j laptop: https://termbin.com/vlzw
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[01:03:42] it won't be much use doing it once the video has already been captured, would it?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[01:03:50] oh there's no 70-yes-bitmap
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kyv	[01:05:06] Some distros annoyingly disable bitmap fonts.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[01:05:11] no it's not that
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[01:05:17] it looks like on this workstation i created individual .conf files to specifically allow certain bitmap fonts to work
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:05:22] `chown user: file` is a shortcut for `chown user:group file` ?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Pentode	[01:05:35] Kyv: yeah very annoyingly.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[01:05:36] Pentode, yeah was thinking that too... hopefully i can just "view" the stream on the dvr and the camera can do the upload of the files
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[01:07:01] was weird 'cause the camera supports h.265 but the software doesnt... so it was uploading and decoding h.265 then saving re-encoded h.264 i think
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[01:07:54] bernard__: no
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[01:07:58] oh wait, I should try recompiling font-misc-misc
2021-07-20 10:40:20	akik	[01:08:13] what a time to be alive. ms' linux distro install instructions: https://blog.jreypo.io/2021/07/09/a-look-into-cbl-mariner-microsoft-internal-linux-distribution/
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:08:25] curdlesnoot: why do some people do chown user: alone
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[01:08:33] bernard__: actually, yes, sorry. misread.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:08:51] curdlesnoot: you are forgiven my child
2021-07-20 10:40:20	esselfe	[01:09:08] doesn't work
2021-07-20 10:40:20	curdlesnoot	[01:10:04] bernard__: specifically, the primary group, as one would expect.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[01:11:57] good morning
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:12:04] loganlee
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:12:10] oh em geeh
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[01:12:10] hey man
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:12:14] long time
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:14:11] loganlee: you are the language blogs guy right?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[01:14:29] bernard__: nope
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:14:37] oh got confused
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[01:31:04] Anyone know a way to do this in software?  https://snipboard.io/b92CzW.jpg
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[01:36:09] chives: it's in 3D?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	yogoyo	[01:39:12] looks a bit like its taken from the Kerbal Space Program (Game)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[01:39:53] it's just de-fisheye'ing i guess but its doing it specifically on a subset you want to view which is nice, since 40% of that image is uninteresting, you can pick two parts...
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[01:40:06] but its only for temp realtime viewing on the camera when it records its still fisheye
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[01:42:04] chives: https://www.danielplayfaircal.com/blogging/ffmpeg/lensfun/v360/lenscorrection/fisheye/dodgeball/2020/03/24/correcting-lens-distortion-with-ffmpeg.html
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[01:44:00] hmmmmm
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chives	[01:50:18] bernard__, thanks, that is interesting
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:19:06] what if IO was part of the instruction set, maybe as a processor extension (even a microcode one, like one that is handled kernel-side), rather than write/read syscalls?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:19:34] then only 1 syscall would be needed, that would be to open, and the handle given could be used as an 'argument' to IOR/IOW (read and write) as one of the registers
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[02:19:51] jim i heard C is faster than python is this true?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:19:56] this could also apply for network stuff
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:20:01] do you think this idea is good?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:20:05] NO
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:20:08] err, no
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:20:08] surely someone thought of it before me
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:20:10] byte4byte_: it is tho
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:20:13] ayecee: oh?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:20:30] hmm, alright. I'd love to hear your reasoning :)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:21:04] relies too much on magic
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:21:23] typical murican reasoning :p
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:21:25] a cpu instruction that handles radically different kinds of IO
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:21:26] nah jk
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:21:34] oh uh
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:21:47] no, it just handles the software side of IO rather than requiring a context switch
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:22:05] the kernel would expose a chunk of virtual memory that data can be appended to
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:22:27] okay and then a context switch would happen so the kernel could work on that virtual memory
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:22:56] but at least the context switch wouldn't have to happen right after the instruction
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:23:23] (it'd buffer the virtual memory changes until the kernel got some CPU time, except for IO-intensive programs)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:23:40] whereas write() and read() require an *immediate* context switch by virtue of being a syscall
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:24:57] is that bad
2021-07-20 10:40:20	[[R]]	[02:25:46] 🎶 oh oh... it's magic...
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:26:05] ayecee: yeah, it requires yielding control
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:26:12] okay, is _that_ bad
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:26:16] especially for processes that call write() and read() often, it's quite a bit of redundant overhead
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:26:53] so if a process calls write() and read() *sporadically* and in bursts, these changes shall buffer till X ms have passed
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:27:25] that must be why stdio is buffered already
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:27:39] true, but I don't mean stdio
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:27:51] no, but something that does the same thing
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:27:54] file IO is often buffered (file cache) but this buffering comes after the syscalls so it's not really helpful here
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:28:26] okay like allocating that "virtual memory" is going to involve a context switch too
2021-07-20 10:40:20	 *	rascul [02:28:54] switches the context
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:29:22] either way, if a process calls write() and read() evenly through time, especially one that is seldom on idle sleep, it might be a game or another program that more on IO latency enough to justify the tradeoff of a bit of overhead; there, the special instructions would still apply, but context switching would happen right away, instead of a few cycles down the line
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:29:35] ayecee: it would be done on init. and then sub-allocated by open()
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:29:47] file open or socket open or etc
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:29:50] basically for any FD
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:30:17] on init as in, on spawn()/fork()
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:30:22] so like a fixed allocation of memory for every process
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:30:34] yeah, although it would be sparse
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:30:34] for each fd it could open
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:30:44] okay and what makes it unsparse
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:30:49] suballocation
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:30:52] no
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:30:54] it would be unsparse to a fixed block size
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:31:08] because having to sparsely allocate everytime you write or read something would be antithetic to the goal of not needing syscalls
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:31:12] "sparse" memory, when used, triggers a page fault
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:31:28] that would happen on a file descriptor open
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:31:56] the block size would adjust to the average write/read size between the vmem IO queue flush intervals determined by the aforementioned metric
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:32:10] (where a game would have a lower interval, or even just an immediate flag, for its metric would be more even than sporadic)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:32:49] i can't really follow what your idea is. it seems to be some sort of magic to solve a single problem, "syscalls bad".
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:32:53] running a system update in theb ackground, so everything is slow as heck
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:33:01] ayecee: syscalls are overhead
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:33:12] this is virtual-memory-based syscall deference
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:33:26] which would have its own overhead
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:33:46] yeah but it wouldn't happen all the time
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:34:04] syscalls don't happen all the time either
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:34:05] I think IO overhead is somewhat redundant, at least in terms of how it requires context switching for every single read/write call, it just feels... squanderous to me, but maybe that's just me
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:34:19] i think it is
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:34:35] hm
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:36:15] Gustavo6046: note that a page fault is quite a bit more expensive than a system call, even before you do any page table changes - syscall is a faster context switch instruction than a trap/fault
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:36:29] hmm
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:36:31] fair enough
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:36:36] so instead of sparse memory
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:36:51] and TLB shootdowns are horribly expensive in comparison
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:36:58] Gustavo6046: come on man.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:37:01] Gustavo6046: cut it out.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:37:05] kernel would keep a relational in-memory table of process # | file descriptor | virtual memory location | etc
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:37:27] and the open() sycall would include appending to this table
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:37:36] a close() would remove an item from this table, or just set it vacant
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:38:21] Gustavo6046: that's kinda how it works now, yes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:38:30] ah
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:38:33] just moving the bones to a different grave
2021-07-20 10:40:20	rascul	[02:38:57] Gustavo6046 maybe look up io_uring
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:39:01] only with a bit more indirection and using the page cache, not just virtual memory
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:39:05] ooh
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:39:07] ring buffers
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:39:09] nnh
2021-07-20 10:40:20	puff	[02:39:22] I need to free up disk space, what's the easiest way to check if a diectory is fully present on my backup drive?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:39:27] uring does nicely solve the 'syscalls are expensive' issue
2021-07-20 10:40:20	puff	[02:39:29] Hm, I guess I could use rsync with dry-run?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:39:30] danieldg: virtual memory would ultimately map into some in-kernel memory
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:39:46] I can't reckon this table being so large as to require swapping, but I guess just in case.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:39:48] puff: worth a try
2021-07-20 10:40:20	puff	[02:39:58] I have a dd backup of a raspberry pi that I need to unzip and dd back onto a raspberry pi, but I don't have enough free disk to unzip it.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:40:18] Gustavo6046: it's called the inode cache, and it doesn't swap - it just gets deleted and can be recreated on demand
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:40:25] ahhh.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:40:36] well, it's a cache though
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:40:54] those entries are kinda important because in my idea they tell where in vmem the kernel lets you write to the IO queues
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:41:15] puff: one would normally unzip it into a pipe into dd instead of writing to disk in between
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:41:21] and the custom kernel microcode would decide whether to syscall write/read right away or defer it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:41:38] Gustavo6046: yeah, that would be "anywhere in the page cache that corresponds to a file you can write to"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:41:43] I wonder if two context-switching operations can be batteried together and if that would be benefitting
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:41:53] so if it's going to do a CS anyways might as well do write/read right before that
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:42:07] or if it yields control to another process
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:42:10] (also helps prevent potential race conditions)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:42:11] Gustavo6046: less noise please.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:42:17] um, apologies?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:42:28] i get that you're really excited to hear yourself talk, but it's not so good from this end.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:42:42] you mean I should press enter less often? I hear that often, and I try, I swear
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[02:42:43] oh shit
2021-07-20 10:40:20	puff	[02:42:50] ayecee: aha, good point, thanks.  I'm a bit brainfried.  Wildfire smoke has made it to my town and it's knocknig me for a loop.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:42:52] no, that's not what i mean
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[02:42:59] Gustavo6046, you gonna take that?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:43:28] Gustavo6046: you're talking at length about something you barely understand and arguing with people about it.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:43:52] danieldg: but how would the process (or rather, its microcode thingy) know which part of vmem to write to? it's not so much a cache in this case
2021-07-20 10:40:20	byte4byte_	[02:43:58] now he calling you dumb
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:44:07] ayecee: yeah, true, I'm not trying to push anything
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:44:13] although I'm*
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:44:22] i'm not saying you're pushing anything.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:44:23] Gustavo6046: no, this is kernel code
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:44:40] Gustavo6046: you should understand how it works before making changes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:45:15] eh. maybe not that. making changes would be a way to find out how it works.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:45:29] _talking_ about making changes, not so much
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:45:38] ayecee: ok, point
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:48:08] I don't mean to make changes, but yeah
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:48:20] you should make changes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:48:26] just maybe someone would be able to concoct a more useful idea from my ramblings :p
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:48:39] not likely
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:49:05] Gustavo6046: the way to make that happen is to build a system with the changes you propose and show it's faster in benchmark X
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:49:24] rather than having it be in kernel, my idea was that the kernel could have its own microcode that slightly alters CPU instructions from executables as they are loaded in order to allow some flexibility in implementing some of the lower level mechanisms that directly involve the code being executed, such as this; for instance, in my idea, it'd replace syscalls to write/read *if* this functionality
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:49:26] was enabled for that process
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:49:31] come on man
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:49:46] you type fast, but maybe type less
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:50:08] Gustavo6046: so, prototype that out
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:50:17] hmm
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:50:24] that sounds scary for some reason
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:50:29] it should
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:50:43] it's a pretty hard process, yep
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[02:50:44] oh my god i'm trying to understand subneting... i haven't got it quite right
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:50:46] can I use qemu to benchmark it?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:50:51] sure
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:50:51] sure
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Gustavo6046	[02:50:55] ah
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:51:58] that'll just give you estimates, though; next would be actually getting a processor simulator (say, a riscv one)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:52:41] because you're dealing with timing changes in the nanoseconds
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:52:47] getting a little ahead, i think
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:52:57] but yeah, start with qemu
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:53:10] making it work would already be a huge step
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ayecee	[02:53:30] to put abstract and hazy ramblings into a concrete form
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danieldg	[02:53:34] yeah, qemu is a "see you in a year" type project
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bernard__	[02:58:06] Gustavo6046: como vai

2021-07-20 10:40:20	Psi-Jack	[03:33:59] I did Surviving Mars without issue.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	[[R]]	[03:35:01] that one was too hard
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Psi-Jack	[03:35:21] It is dang hard!

2021-07-20 10:40:20	[[R]]	[03:35:43] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Psi-Jack	[03:36:41] Evil Genius is fun though. Glad I was able to get it working again. 🙂

2021-07-20 10:40:20	Psi-Jack	[03:39:54] I played the original, and 2 is just as funny, quirky, and good. 🙂
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Psi-Jack	[03:40:28] Though I miss torturing people in the blender. That seems gone in 2.

2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[04:55:57] Can I give a partition a label using fdisk (util-linux)?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:57:08] Izem: you can't -- fdisk doesn't support that
2021-07-20 10:40:20	hexnewbie	[04:57:17] Izem: You can with gdisk
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:57:17] Izem: did you mean gdisk?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:57:28] partition labels usually mean GPT :)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[04:57:34] no, fdisk the command line utility
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:57:36] you'll need a partition editor that supports GPT like gdisk or gparted
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:57:49] Izem: no: fdisk doesn't support GPT -- it only supports MBR
2021-07-20 10:40:20	hexnewbie	[04:57:54] Although fdisk has n (change partition name) in the x (expert menu)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:57:57] Izem: and MBR partitions don't have labels
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[04:58:04] oh
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[04:58:11] hmmm
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:58:25] Izem: maybe you meant for an ext2/3/4 filesystem label?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:58:35] Izem: in this case, you'd use tune2fs
2021-07-20 10:40:20	hexnewbie	[04:58:48] fdisk supports GPT. Does not print the labels, however an option to change the name (label) exists in the expert menu. Have never used that (gdisk is so much nicer)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[04:58:55] I'm not sure what the term is, but I used fatlabel to get the effect I wanted
2021-07-20 10:40:20	 *	loganlee [04:59:06] reminisces reiser fs 
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[04:59:38] ah, filesystem label is the term
2021-07-20 10:40:20	hexnewbie	[04:59:48] Hmm, that's nice: Work on a computer that has /dev/sdal and is using a font in which you don't know how 1/l look like
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[04:59:54] Izem: ah, yes -- that's a filesystem label -- depends on the filesystem
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:00:10] I remember having issues with some OSes not being able to handle my thumbdrive without the label
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:00:21] Izem: I suggest that you stop using fdisk
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:00:47] Izem: only reason you should be using fdisk is bceause it's the only tool you have access to (which shouldn't be the case in the first place) and you're maintaining an old legacy system
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:00:57] I'm currently trying to figure out why this device only shows up in the dolphin file manager and not in "disks & devices"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:01:03] on a kde desktop
2021-07-20 10:40:20	hexnewbie	[05:01:04] GPT on thumb drives may be odd and less portable (particularly to semi-archaic systems)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:01:28] mlu yes you guessed right again :P
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:01:43] though I'm not on a legacy system
2021-07-20 10:40:20	iflema	[05:02:05] mlu: what OS are you on and is it 15 years old?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	iflema	[05:02:12] the install
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:02:24] hah, it better be 15yo if it has fdisk but not gdisk :P
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:02:38] and if it's 15yo, that's a hella legacy system
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:02:41] it does have cfdisk
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:02:45] no, that doesn't count :P
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:02:55] cfdisk was fun in the days, but you really need gdisk or gparted
2021-07-20 10:40:20	 *	mlu [05:03:12] double-checks busybox for gdisk presence
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[05:03:15] was reiser fs revolutionary in its day?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:03:29] I'm also curious as to why fdisk seems to have C/H/S output displayed?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:03:30] or even gptfdisk?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	hexnewbie	[05:03:36] gdisk, cgdisk and sgdisk are not usually installed by default on any distro, and fdisk/cfdisk/sfdisk work with GPT (have not actually trying sfdisk there)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:03:37] loganlee: it felt revolutionary back in the day
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:03:48] loganlee: however, as I learned a bit more about filesystem,s I learned why it was fast
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:04:06] loganlee: long story short, reiserfs gained speed by skipping a lot of prudent safety mechanisms
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:04:15] :O
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:04:19] his filesystem respected your data pretty much as much as he respected life: not much
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[05:04:29] mlu: ok...
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:04:30] oof
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:04:59] that would explain all the horror stories with reiserfsck, etc.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:05:14] and to his credit, the filesystem was fast -- just make sure you have good backups
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:05:20] but then again, you could just use ext3 without journaling
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:05:29] what filesystem are you using for your Linux setup?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:05:38] these days, I use ext4 -- it's fast and good enough
2021-07-20 10:40:20	loganlee	[05:05:56] i juse use ext4 because it sound like new
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:05:59] also, I have NVMe SSDs these days -- they're literally faster than ramdisks of yesteryear
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:06:06] yeah, I'm interested in btrfs because of it's snapshot ability
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:06:08] ext4's a good fs -- why not?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	hexnewbie	[05:06:09] The horror stories with reiserfsck mainly result from the rebuild tree image vulnerability, otherwise reiserfs is quite robust and the rebuild tree makes it able to recover from failures other filesystems wouldn't
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:06:25] it's fast if it does what you need -- but if you need snapshotting or other fun stuff, btrfs and ZFS are great options
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:06:45] ZFS seems weird outside of *BSD
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:06:57] is ZFS on Linux still progressing?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:07:05] it's usable
2021-07-20 10:40:20	hexnewbie	[05:07:15] Izem: Only because it's weird in itself, ZFS on Linux is quite fine. And is OpenZFS upstream now.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:07:15] but I personally ask myself: why?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arcturus	[05:07:31] i prefer btrfs
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:07:32] if I needed snapshotting and all of that fancy stuff, there's probably a SAN handling it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:07:35] and I'd just export NFS from there
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:07:41] maybe SMB too if I have any Windows clients
2021-07-20 10:40:20	mlu	[05:07:59] just remember: ext4 is much faster if you don't need any of the fancy stuff
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:08:07] Have you tried to experiment the network storage using 9fs?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:08:23] v9fs in Linux is slow as molasses though
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:08:39] I'm really interested in why :)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	paulcarroty	[05:09:45] hey, please report this man on github: https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5#issuecomment-882516952 'cause threatening open source developers isn't acceptable.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Izem	[05:10:04] mlu I don't think I need snapshotting, that would be the easy way out of my (development) troubles though

2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:42:29] well, my VGA cable just broke
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:42:46] https://termbin.com/thny if someone is interested in `xrandr --prop` on my laptop
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[22:43:26] look at all those supported colorspaces
2021-07-20 10:40:42	jim	[22:43:33] wasjust about to ask him to do that
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:43:36] coerce "Broadcast RGB" to "Limited 16:235" as a starting point. that's typically what an LCD TV expects after agreeing to accept RGB over HDMI, prior to any fiddling with the settings.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:43:51] settings on the TV side, I mean.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:44:45] right now it's "Automatic", which means YPbPr is on the cards and I'll bet a nickel that's what's being used now.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:45:08] it's supposed to be "Full". Are you looking at the right screen?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:45:41] it's currently "Automatic". you should not use "Full" unless you are 100% positive your TV is in agreement.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:46:29] some LCD TVs don't even support it. if you mismatch the quantisation range, you can screw up the colour in brand new ways.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:46:45] HDMI-1 connected 1360x768+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 1150mm x 650mm
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:46:46] ...
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:46:46] 	Broadcast RGB: Full
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:46:46] 		supported: Automatic, Full, Limited 16:235
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:47:09] oh yeah. sorry, was looking at the wrong port.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:47:18] curdlesnoot: I don't care it will screw up colors; at least it won't broke like some old tech
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:47:34] yes, well it can't possibly do any damage.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:47:44] anyway, give Limited a go.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[22:48:09] jim why should i learn python over C?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:48:11] done
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[22:48:14] the screen blinked
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:48:16] TheWild: try them all. if nothing looks good, poke around in your TV settings and see if there's a way to instruct the TV as the the colourspace/range it should expect on a given port.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:48:27] TheWild: I know how to do this for modern-ish Sony TVs only.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:49:18] HDMI is supposed to auto-negotiate for "automatic" but it only takes one of the devices to have other plans.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:50:42] also, there's a chart you can use to check whether the rgb quantisation level is properly in agreement but that's probably premature at this stage.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[22:54:31] there's some background information on this topic here: http://junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php?title=XRGB-mini_FRAMEMEISTER#HDMI_Set_.E2.86.92_Output_Range
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[23:00:41] I've been playing with some settings and the screen blinks, but it seems like the TV is ignoring pretty much everything.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:01:15] so, even "Automatic" is bad?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[23:02:31] yup
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:02:40] then I think your options are to get to the bottom of the TV settings (if there even are any that are relevant) or get a new VGA cable.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[23:03:04] heh
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[23:03:04] it has a service RS-232 port :D
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[23:08:27] ok, I gonna grab the VGA cable from the office and see how it works out.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	TheWild	[23:08:27] curdlesnoot: thanks for support
2021-07-20 10:40:42	jim	[23:18:45] byte4byte_, maybe you should learn something like python, perl or lua (there's more to this list), one purpose, to prototype apps you'd do a more robust/complete version in c or c++. WORD OF WARNING... I've been getting complaints, and I have carte blanche to do whatever. so, TAKE CARE OF YOUR BEHAVIOR. Otherwise, you could be gone from here for a very long time.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	jim	[23:20:48] byte4byte_, another thing, python/perl/lua have very extensive addon libs, which you might look into, to see if you can use one or more libs in those.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:21:31] LUA me alone :P
2021-07-20 10:40:42	jim	[23:22:02] I heard lua is very fast
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:23:04] its easier to read than perl but python has more points for me
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:23:53] i think kpie (the successor of devilspie 1 and 2) was written in lua
2021-07-20 10:40:42	jim	[23:29:07] also, those languages have an object system, and have fully internalized all the allocation/freeing of objects in that system
2021-07-20 10:40:42	jim	[23:29:31] (aka: you don't have to deal with it)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:38:19] jim what complaints have you heard the use of the word "nerd"?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:38:24] how is that negative?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:38:45] and if i cant use the word nerd why dont people have to call me anything i please?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:38:59] its a 2 way street
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[23:39:03] byte4byte_: your website su@$s
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:39:47] lawyering, not two way street
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:40:26] byte4byte_: a nerd is a derogative terminus
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:40:53] i dont thin knerd is derogative
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:41:00] but most others do
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:41:16] i get offended when people dont call me king
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:41:22] does that mean they have to call me king?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:41:29] in your channel, yes
2021-07-20 10:40:42	MrMobius	[23:45:21] if i want to log in, start a program crunching some numbers, then log out and come back a few days later, is there a better way than something like tmux?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:45:47] better in what way
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:47:10] if you have an interactive terminal program and you want to log out and come back to it later, then no, tmux or screen are where it's at.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:48:00] so jim can you add "no usage of word nerd & must call byte4byte king" in the topic?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:48:15] if it's not interactive, you can redirect its output to a file and run it in the background
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[23:48:37] or simply "the word nerd can be used"
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:48:53] or maybe say byebye to bytebyte
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:49:10] could somebody do something like "ssh user@host command_xy &"?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:49:25] yogoyo: alas, that would put the ssh session in the background
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:49:35] oops
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:49:48] i think
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:50:11] i need to construct a test program
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:51:42] doh, i have no vps at the moment and no sshd either
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[23:52:02] *shrug* we might as well wait to see if there's more info about the nature of the program
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:52:15] yup
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:53:03] it almost certainly won't do what you expect. now, ssh -n user@host 'command_xy >/dev/null 2>&1 &' will be closer to the mark.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:53:22] unless you really did mean to background ssh(1) instead.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:54:43] even in the latter case, ssh -f might be more appropriate.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:54:44] curdlesnoot: i wanted to test a simpler solution to screen and tmux
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:54:53] ok, so not the latter case.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:55:34] there are plenty of pitfalls. you should close fd 0, and send fd 1 and fd 2 elsewhere, as noted.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:56:00] otherewise, expect ssh(1) to dutifully wait regardless.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:56:54] why do i need the stderr redirect?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[23:58:05] let me type that into greg's tutorial search thingie
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[23:58:13] yogoyo: http://www.snailbook.com/faq/background-jobs.auto.html
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:00:26] a page without ads noise :)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Kyv	[00:00:48] good old greg
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:02:46] curdlesnoot: thanks a bunch, i learn something useful
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:11:23] it requires a bit more knowledge about the system internals and the point of view of a programmer to fully get it. but for now i know that i should try to provide race conditions
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:11:44] prevent :)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	 *	rascul [00:14:03] races yogoyo
2021-07-20 10:40:42	 *	yogoyo [00:16:55] installs supertuxkart just in case
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[00:17:06] yogoyo: further, you want the sshd instance to actually exit.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:19:48] curdlesnoot: it would unnecessarily bind resources or would there be another problem when that sshd instance does not quit?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:20:28] with fedora i get a new kernel every 1-2 days. so i need to reboot anyways
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[00:21:13] yogoyo: as noted by the article, sshd will never observe eof.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:23:45] Hello People
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:25:09] curdlesnoot: what would you write as tag line for a todo list? "inter process communication" or something like that?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:25:52] Been reading some old PC mags; wow how things have changed. To start PC mags were a thing.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[00:26:23] yogoyo: you mean, as concerns this topic? yes, it falls under the issue of inter-process communication (not least, as pipes are involved).
2021-07-20 10:40:42	iflema	[00:26:40] blackgatonegro: yeah they had dvd on the cover
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:26:49] Installing Linux was an Oddisey, Windows wasn't spyware, and  so on.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:26:52] curdlesnoot: heh, and without the help of pipes?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[00:27:14] yogoyo: only in the loosest sense. but I would still say yes.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:27:48] iflema try floppies
2021-07-20 10:40:42	iflema	[00:28:10] I used to like mikes 10 billion distros in one dvd with menu
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:28:28] I still have a few old pc mags that cane with floppies; dunno were the heck the floppies ended.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:28:52] *came
2021-07-20 10:40:42	iflema	[00:28:59] blackgatonegro: 26 of em
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:29:23] floppies needed no "sync" like usb pendrives. you could follow the sound of the drive
2021-07-20 10:40:42	iflema	[00:29:29] i couldnt hadle floppies alway a few duds in the set
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:29:30] But mostly I remember when PC mags started to include CDs with demos and shareware, fub times.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	iflema	[00:29:41] speakers and microwaves and whatever
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:30:07] Nah back in the early 90s floppies actually were of good quality.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:30:45] They also weren't cheap.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:31:03] the 5,25" ones were bad
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:31:52] Actually flat floppies ended lasting me more for some reason, you just had to you know; be careful handling them.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[00:32:18] not all drives were manufactured equal, for that matter. I recall once testing a pile of floppy drives with a DOS utility whose name now escapes me.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:32:31] It was like handling something made of crystal, be slow and careful and they lasted a lot.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[00:32:39] it helped me select the one that was most reliably able to deal with novel formats.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:33:35] While I started with DOS by the time I had my own computer, it came with Windows 95 .
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:33:44] novel netware 3
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:34:19] 1 disk missing and you notice near the end of the installation
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:34:45] maybe thats where my head is gone missing
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:34:58] Ah yeah, the problem with installing big programs that came in several disks
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Sauvin	[00:35:07] blackgatonegro, the 3.5" floppies had higher densities, 3.5" drives had smaller RW heads, and the whole get-up was a lot more sensitive to bit rot.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:35:11] It was a pain.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:35:50] But before Win95 I usually used small stuff that fit in a single disk so I didn't have to deal with that much.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:37:14] 1 floppy was enough to fit several old DOS games like snake, and.. prehistoric I think?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	iflema	[00:37:32] i got in in 98  some folks couldnt figure out napster so i had a crack :S
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:37:59] :D
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:38:57] I remember Windows 98, such a pain. You literally had to reinstall it every few months, win98se was slightly better.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[00:39:45] the tun is tuna
2021-07-20 10:40:42	rascul	[00:40:26] https://www.wired.com/2009/05/five-disk-floppy-raid-4mb-of-blistering-fast-storage/
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:41:13] Anyway the first Linux I used ran inside Windows, it came in a PC mag CD and... at least it booted. Kinda rad for the year 1999.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	rascul	[00:41:46] loadlin.exe existed in 1999
2021-07-20 10:40:42	zjmc_	[00:42:13] cool diskette raid
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:43:32] Anyway I then got Linux on my second desktop in 2008... then after two weeks of dealing with 2008 CemtOs, got the tech guy to install me ubuntu instead.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Kyv	[00:44:25] tonight on vh1's 'before they were stars'
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:44:49] Still keep using my win98 machine for years, cause games.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:47:01] And then Gnome 3 and Ubuntu Unity dss
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:47:09] desktop happened - -
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:47:10] esselfe: ever get that to work? just curious.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[00:49:46] blackgatonegro: may i ask you something via private message?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	blackgatonegro	[00:49:58] Go ahead.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:51:30] I can't recall what :P
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:51:49] vnc?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:52:56] man you went far in the backlogs!
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:55:00] I had couple problems tonight
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:55:03] lmao sorry
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:55:10] yeah vnc
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:55:35] oh no, the vnc server works on my laptop but it fails on my tower
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:55:39] i just like to have an idea of what works in case anyone else asks a similar / same question s
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:56:00] still gives you that font error after enabling bitmap fonts?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:56:04] I took the one from realvnc since tightvnc (which they use) doesn't compile
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:56:12] ah
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:56:15] darn
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:56:22] yes, my distro dev say it's not the bitmap thing
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[00:56:40] Anyone here familiar with cameras?  I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to not do... well i think they are doing double encoding, no?  The stream from the camera is encoded, and then decoded by the dvr, and re-encoded... isnt there a way to just raw... well now as i type this i wonder if it can just upload to a share
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:56:55] hmm. i can't imagine what else it could be.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:56:58] he helped me getting it working with 'vncserver -fp /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc'
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:57:22] it's a pretty common issue with software that rely on x's older font infrastructure
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:57:32] fc-list reports lots of fixed fonts
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:57:34] ah
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:57:49] oh good
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[00:58:10] i know most distro's disable them now-a-days so i thought there was a good chance that was the problem
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:58:45] and weirdly /usr/share/fonts/X11 there's only OTF whilst on my laptop it's full of font dirs
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[00:59:06] all the fonts seem in /usr/share/fonts and that fails with -fp
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[01:00:38] look it's all there :) https://termbin.com/vh0k (fc-list | grep -i fixed)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[01:01:52] what does ls -l /etc/fonts/conf.d | grep bitmap look like on either machine?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[01:02:04] yall know if there is a software that will warp a video from fisheye to a specific shape?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[01:02:28] there camera has softawre that lets you view realtime that way but it doesnt actually save video that way
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[01:03:08] tower: https://termbin.com/p11j laptop: https://termbin.com/vlzw
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[01:03:42] it won't be much use doing it once the video has already been captured, would it?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[01:03:50] oh there's no 70-yes-bitmap
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Kyv	[01:05:06] Some distros annoyingly disable bitmap fonts.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[01:05:11] no it's not that
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[01:05:17] it looks like on this workstation i created individual .conf files to specifically allow certain bitmap fonts to work
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:05:22] `chown user: file` is a shortcut for `chown user:group file` ?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Pentode	[01:05:35] Kyv: yeah very annoyingly.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[01:05:36] Pentode, yeah was thinking that too... hopefully i can just "view" the stream on the dvr and the camera can do the upload of the files
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[01:07:01] was weird 'cause the camera supports h.265 but the software doesnt... so it was uploading and decoding h.265 then saving re-encoded h.264 i think
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[01:07:54] bernard__: no
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[01:07:58] oh wait, I should try recompiling font-misc-misc
2021-07-20 10:40:42	akik	[01:08:13] what a time to be alive. ms' linux distro install instructions: https://blog.jreypo.io/2021/07/09/a-look-into-cbl-mariner-microsoft-internal-linux-distribution/
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:08:25] curdlesnoot: why do some people do chown user: alone
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[01:08:33] bernard__: actually, yes, sorry. misread.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:08:51] curdlesnoot: you are forgiven my child
2021-07-20 10:40:42	esselfe	[01:09:08] doesn't work
2021-07-20 10:40:42	curdlesnoot	[01:10:04] bernard__: specifically, the primary group, as one would expect.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[01:11:57] good morning
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:12:04] loganlee
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:12:10] oh em geeh
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[01:12:10] hey man
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:12:14] long time
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:14:11] loganlee: you are the language blogs guy right?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[01:14:29] bernard__: nope
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:14:37] oh got confused
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[01:31:04] Anyone know a way to do this in software?  https://snipboard.io/b92CzW.jpg
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[01:36:09] chives: it's in 3D?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	yogoyo	[01:39:12] looks a bit like its taken from the Kerbal Space Program (Game)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[01:39:53] it's just de-fisheye'ing i guess but its doing it specifically on a subset you want to view which is nice, since 40% of that image is uninteresting, you can pick two parts...
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[01:40:06] but its only for temp realtime viewing on the camera when it records its still fisheye
2021-07-20 10:40:42	bernard__	[01:42:04] chives: https://www.danielplayfaircal.com/blogging/ffmpeg/lensfun/v360/lenscorrection/fisheye/dodgeball/2020/03/24/correcting-lens-distortion-with-ffmpeg.html
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[01:44:00] hmmmmm
2021-07-20 10:40:42	chives	[01:50:18] bernard__, thanks, that is interesting
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:19:06] what if IO was part of the instruction set, maybe as a processor extension (even a microcode one, like one that is handled kernel-side), rather than write/read syscalls?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:19:34] then only 1 syscall would be needed, that would be to open, and the handle given could be used as an 'argument' to IOR/IOW (read and write) as one of the registers
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[02:19:51] jim i heard C is faster than python is this true?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:19:56] this could also apply for network stuff
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:20:01] do you think this idea is good?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:20:05] NO
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:20:08] err, no
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:20:08] surely someone thought of it before me
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:20:10] byte4byte_: it is tho
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:20:13] ayecee: oh?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:20:30] hmm, alright. I'd love to hear your reasoning :)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:21:04] relies too much on magic
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:21:23] typical murican reasoning :p
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:21:25] a cpu instruction that handles radically different kinds of IO
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:21:26] nah jk
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:21:34] oh uh
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:21:47] no, it just handles the software side of IO rather than requiring a context switch
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:22:05] the kernel would expose a chunk of virtual memory that data can be appended to
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:22:27] okay and then a context switch would happen so the kernel could work on that virtual memory
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:22:56] but at least the context switch wouldn't have to happen right after the instruction
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:23:23] (it'd buffer the virtual memory changes until the kernel got some CPU time, except for IO-intensive programs)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:23:40] whereas write() and read() require an *immediate* context switch by virtue of being a syscall
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:24:57] is that bad
2021-07-20 10:40:42	[[R]]	[02:25:46] 🎶 oh oh... it's magic...
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:26:05] ayecee: yeah, it requires yielding control
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:26:12] okay, is _that_ bad
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:26:16] especially for processes that call write() and read() often, it's quite a bit of redundant overhead
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:26:53] so if a process calls write() and read() *sporadically* and in bursts, these changes shall buffer till X ms have passed
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:27:25] that must be why stdio is buffered already
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:27:39] true, but I don't mean stdio
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:27:51] no, but something that does the same thing
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:27:54] file IO is often buffered (file cache) but this buffering comes after the syscalls so it's not really helpful here
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:28:26] okay like allocating that "virtual memory" is going to involve a context switch too
2021-07-20 10:40:42	 *	rascul [02:28:54] switches the context
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:29:22] either way, if a process calls write() and read() evenly through time, especially one that is seldom on idle sleep, it might be a game or another program that more on IO latency enough to justify the tradeoff of a bit of overhead; there, the special instructions would still apply, but context switching would happen right away, instead of a few cycles down the line
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:29:35] ayecee: it would be done on init. and then sub-allocated by open()
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:29:47] file open or socket open or etc
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:29:50] basically for any FD
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:30:17] on init as in, on spawn()/fork()
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:30:22] so like a fixed allocation of memory for every process
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:30:34] yeah, although it would be sparse
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:30:34] for each fd it could open
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:30:44] okay and what makes it unsparse
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:30:49] suballocation
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:30:52] no
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:30:54] it would be unsparse to a fixed block size
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:31:08] because having to sparsely allocate everytime you write or read something would be antithetic to the goal of not needing syscalls
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:31:12] "sparse" memory, when used, triggers a page fault
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:31:28] that would happen on a file descriptor open
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:31:56] the block size would adjust to the average write/read size between the vmem IO queue flush intervals determined by the aforementioned metric
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:32:10] (where a game would have a lower interval, or even just an immediate flag, for its metric would be more even than sporadic)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:32:49] i can't really follow what your idea is. it seems to be some sort of magic to solve a single problem, "syscalls bad".
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:32:53] running a system update in theb ackground, so everything is slow as heck
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:33:01] ayecee: syscalls are overhead
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:33:12] this is virtual-memory-based syscall deference
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:33:26] which would have its own overhead
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:33:46] yeah but it wouldn't happen all the time
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:34:04] syscalls don't happen all the time either
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:34:05] I think IO overhead is somewhat redundant, at least in terms of how it requires context switching for every single read/write call, it just feels... squanderous to me, but maybe that's just me
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:34:19] i think it is
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:34:35] hm
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:36:15] Gustavo6046: note that a page fault is quite a bit more expensive than a system call, even before you do any page table changes - syscall is a faster context switch instruction than a trap/fault
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:36:29] hmm
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:36:31] fair enough
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:36:36] so instead of sparse memory
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:36:51] and TLB shootdowns are horribly expensive in comparison
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:36:58] Gustavo6046: come on man.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:37:01] Gustavo6046: cut it out.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:37:05] kernel would keep a relational in-memory table of process # | file descriptor | virtual memory location | etc
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:37:27] and the open() sycall would include appending to this table
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:37:36] a close() would remove an item from this table, or just set it vacant
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:38:21] Gustavo6046: that's kinda how it works now, yes
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:38:30] ah
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:38:33] just moving the bones to a different grave
2021-07-20 10:40:42	rascul	[02:38:57] Gustavo6046 maybe look up io_uring
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:39:01] only with a bit more indirection and using the page cache, not just virtual memory
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:39:05] ooh
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:39:07] ring buffers
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:39:09] nnh
2021-07-20 10:40:42	puff	[02:39:22] I need to free up disk space, what's the easiest way to check if a diectory is fully present on my backup drive?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:39:27] uring does nicely solve the 'syscalls are expensive' issue
2021-07-20 10:40:42	puff	[02:39:29] Hm, I guess I could use rsync with dry-run?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:39:30] danieldg: virtual memory would ultimately map into some in-kernel memory
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:39:46] I can't reckon this table being so large as to require swapping, but I guess just in case.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:39:48] puff: worth a try
2021-07-20 10:40:42	puff	[02:39:58] I have a dd backup of a raspberry pi that I need to unzip and dd back onto a raspberry pi, but I don't have enough free disk to unzip it.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:40:18] Gustavo6046: it's called the inode cache, and it doesn't swap - it just gets deleted and can be recreated on demand
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:40:25] ahhh.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:40:36] well, it's a cache though
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:40:54] those entries are kinda important because in my idea they tell where in vmem the kernel lets you write to the IO queues
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:41:15] puff: one would normally unzip it into a pipe into dd instead of writing to disk in between
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:41:21] and the custom kernel microcode would decide whether to syscall write/read right away or defer it
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:41:38] Gustavo6046: yeah, that would be "anywhere in the page cache that corresponds to a file you can write to"
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:41:43] I wonder if two context-switching operations can be batteried together and if that would be benefitting
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:41:53] so if it's going to do a CS anyways might as well do write/read right before that
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:42:07] or if it yields control to another process
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:42:10] (also helps prevent potential race conditions)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:42:11] Gustavo6046: less noise please.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:42:17] um, apologies?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:42:28] i get that you're really excited to hear yourself talk, but it's not so good from this end.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:42:42] you mean I should press enter less often? I hear that often, and I try, I swear
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[02:42:43] oh shit
2021-07-20 10:40:42	puff	[02:42:50] ayecee: aha, good point, thanks.  I'm a bit brainfried.  Wildfire smoke has made it to my town and it's knocknig me for a loop.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:42:52] no, that's not what i mean
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[02:42:59] Gustavo6046, you gonna take that?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:43:28] Gustavo6046: you're talking at length about something you barely understand and arguing with people about it.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:43:52] danieldg: but how would the process (or rather, its microcode thingy) know which part of vmem to write to? it's not so much a cache in this case
2021-07-20 10:40:42	byte4byte_	[02:43:58] now he calling you dumb
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:44:07] ayecee: yeah, true, I'm not trying to push anything
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:44:13] although I'm*
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:44:22] i'm not saying you're pushing anything.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:44:23] Gustavo6046: no, this is kernel code
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:44:40] Gustavo6046: you should understand how it works before making changes
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:45:15] eh. maybe not that. making changes would be a way to find out how it works.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:45:29] _talking_ about making changes, not so much
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:45:38] ayecee: ok, point
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:48:08] I don't mean to make changes, but yeah
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:48:20] you should make changes
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:48:26] just maybe someone would be able to concoct a more useful idea from my ramblings :p
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:48:39] not likely
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:49:05] Gustavo6046: the way to make that happen is to build a system with the changes you propose and show it's faster in benchmark X
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:49:24] rather than having it be in kernel, my idea was that the kernel could have its own microcode that slightly alters CPU instructions from executables as they are loaded in order to allow some flexibility in implementing some of the lower level mechanisms that directly involve the code being executed, such as this; for instance, in my idea, it'd replace syscalls to write/read *if* this functionality
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:49:26] was enabled for that process
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:49:31] come on man
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:49:46] you type fast, but maybe type less
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:50:08] Gustavo6046: so, prototype that out
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:50:17] hmm
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:50:24] that sounds scary for some reason
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:50:29] it should
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:50:43] it's a pretty hard process, yep
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[02:50:44] oh my god i'm trying to understand subneting... i haven't got it quite right
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:50:46] can I use qemu to benchmark it?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:50:51] sure
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:50:51] sure
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Gustavo6046	[02:50:55] ah
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:51:58] that'll just give you estimates, though; next would be actually getting a processor simulator (say, a riscv one)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:52:41] because you're dealing with timing changes in the nanoseconds
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:52:47] getting a little ahead, i think
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:52:57] but yeah, start with qemu
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:53:10] making it work would already be a huge step
2021-07-20 10:40:42	ayecee	[02:53:30] to put abstract and hazy ramblings into a concrete form
2021-07-20 10:40:42	danieldg	[02:53:34] yeah, qemu is a "see you in a year" type project

2021-07-20 10:40:42	Psi-Jack	[03:36:41] Evil Genius is fun though. Glad I was able to get it working again. 🙂
2021-07-20 10:40:42	[[R]]	[03:39:39] someoen at work was telling me about it
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Psi-Jack	[03:39:54] I played the original, and 2 is just as funny, quirky, and good. 🙂
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Psi-Jack	[03:40:28] Though I miss torturing people in the blender. That seems gone in 2.

2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[04:55:57] Can I give a partition a label using fdisk (util-linux)?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:57:08] Izem: you can't -- fdisk doesn't support that
2021-07-20 10:40:42	hexnewbie	[04:57:17] Izem: You can with gdisk
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:57:17] Izem: did you mean gdisk?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:57:28] partition labels usually mean GPT :)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[04:57:34] no, fdisk the command line utility
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:57:36] you'll need a partition editor that supports GPT like gdisk or gparted
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:57:49] Izem: no: fdisk doesn't support GPT -- it only supports MBR
2021-07-20 10:40:42	hexnewbie	[04:57:54] Although fdisk has n (change partition name) in the x (expert menu)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:57:57] Izem: and MBR partitions don't have labels
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[04:58:04] oh
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[04:58:11] hmmm
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:58:25] Izem: maybe you meant for an ext2/3/4 filesystem label?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:58:35] Izem: in this case, you'd use tune2fs
2021-07-20 10:40:42	hexnewbie	[04:58:48] fdisk supports GPT. Does not print the labels, however an option to change the name (label) exists in the expert menu. Have never used that (gdisk is so much nicer)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[04:58:55] I'm not sure what the term is, but I used fatlabel to get the effect I wanted
2021-07-20 10:40:42	 *	loganlee [04:59:06] reminisces reiser fs 
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[04:59:38] ah, filesystem label is the term
2021-07-20 10:40:42	hexnewbie	[04:59:48] Hmm, that's nice: Work on a computer that has /dev/sdal and is using a font in which you don't know how 1/l look like
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[04:59:54] Izem: ah, yes -- that's a filesystem label -- depends on the filesystem
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:00:10] I remember having issues with some OSes not being able to handle my thumbdrive without the label
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:00:21] Izem: I suggest that you stop using fdisk
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:00:47] Izem: only reason you should be using fdisk is bceause it's the only tool you have access to (which shouldn't be the case in the first place) and you're maintaining an old legacy system
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:00:57] I'm currently trying to figure out why this device only shows up in the dolphin file manager and not in "disks & devices"
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:01:03] on a kde desktop
2021-07-20 10:40:42	hexnewbie	[05:01:04] GPT on thumb drives may be odd and less portable (particularly to semi-archaic systems)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:01:28] mlu yes you guessed right again :P
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:01:43] though I'm not on a legacy system
2021-07-20 10:40:42	iflema	[05:02:05] mlu: what OS are you on and is it 15 years old?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	iflema	[05:02:12] the install
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:02:24] hah, it better be 15yo if it has fdisk but not gdisk :P
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:02:38] and if it's 15yo, that's a hella legacy system
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:02:41] it does have cfdisk
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:02:45] no, that doesn't count :P
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:02:55] cfdisk was fun in the days, but you really need gdisk or gparted
2021-07-20 10:40:42	 *	mlu [05:03:12] double-checks busybox for gdisk presence
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[05:03:15] was reiser fs revolutionary in its day?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:03:29] I'm also curious as to why fdisk seems to have C/H/S output displayed?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:03:30] or even gptfdisk?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	hexnewbie	[05:03:36] gdisk, cgdisk and sgdisk are not usually installed by default on any distro, and fdisk/cfdisk/sfdisk work with GPT (have not actually trying sfdisk there)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:03:37] loganlee: it felt revolutionary back in the day
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:03:48] loganlee: however, as I learned a bit more about filesystem,s I learned why it was fast
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:04:06] loganlee: long story short, reiserfs gained speed by skipping a lot of prudent safety mechanisms
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:04:15] :O
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:04:19] his filesystem respected your data pretty much as much as he respected life: not much
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[05:04:29] mlu: ok...
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:04:30] oof
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:04:59] that would explain all the horror stories with reiserfsck, etc.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:05:14] and to his credit, the filesystem was fast -- just make sure you have good backups
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:05:20] but then again, you could just use ext3 without journaling
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:05:29] what filesystem are you using for your Linux setup?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:05:38] these days, I use ext4 -- it's fast and good enough
2021-07-20 10:40:42	loganlee	[05:05:56] i juse use ext4 because it sound like new
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:05:59] also, I have NVMe SSDs these days -- they're literally faster than ramdisks of yesteryear
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:06:06] yeah, I'm interested in btrfs because of it's snapshot ability
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:06:08] ext4's a good fs -- why not?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	hexnewbie	[05:06:09] The horror stories with reiserfsck mainly result from the rebuild tree image vulnerability, otherwise reiserfs is quite robust and the rebuild tree makes it able to recover from failures other filesystems wouldn't
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:06:25] it's fast if it does what you need -- but if you need snapshotting or other fun stuff, btrfs and ZFS are great options
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:06:45] ZFS seems weird outside of *BSD
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:06:57] is ZFS on Linux still progressing?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:07:05] it's usable
2021-07-20 10:40:42	hexnewbie	[05:07:15] Izem: Only because it's weird in itself, ZFS on Linux is quite fine. And is OpenZFS upstream now.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:07:15] but I personally ask myself: why?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	arcturus	[05:07:31] i prefer btrfs
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:07:32] if I needed snapshotting and all of that fancy stuff, there's probably a SAN handling it
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:07:35] and I'd just export NFS from there
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:07:41] maybe SMB too if I have any Windows clients
2021-07-20 10:40:42	mlu	[05:07:59] just remember: ext4 is much faster if you don't need any of the fancy stuff
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:08:07] Have you tried to experiment the network storage using 9fs?
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:08:23] v9fs in Linux is slow as molasses though
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:08:39] I'm really interested in why :)
2021-07-20 10:40:42	paulcarroty	[05:09:45] hey, please report this man on github: https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5#issuecomment-882516952 'cause threatening open source developers isn't acceptable.
2021-07-20 10:40:42	Izem	[05:10:04] mlu I don't think I need snapshotting, that would be the easy way out of my (development) troubles though

2021-07-20 11:28:46	curdlesnoot	[00:26:23] yogoyo: you mean, as concerns this topic? yes, it falls under the issue of inter-process communication (not least, as pipes are involved).

2021-07-20 11:28:46	iflema	[00:29:29] i couldnt hadle floppies alway a few duds in the set
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:29:30] But mostly I remember when PC mags started to include CDs with demos and shareware, fub times.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	iflema	[00:29:41] speakers and microwaves and whatever
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:30:07] Nah back in the early 90s floppies actually were of good quality.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:30:45] They also weren't cheap.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	yogoyo	[00:31:03] the 5,25" ones were bad
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:31:52] Actually flat floppies ended lasting me more for some reason, you just had to you know; be careful handling them.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	curdlesnoot	[00:32:18] not all drives were manufactured equal, for that matter. I recall once testing a pile of floppy drives with a DOS utility whose name now escapes me.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:32:31] It was like handling something made of crystal, be slow and careful and they lasted a lot.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	curdlesnoot	[00:32:39] it helped me select the one that was most reliably able to deal with novel formats.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:33:35] While I started with DOS by the time I had my own computer, it came with Windows 95 .
2021-07-20 11:28:46	yogoyo	[00:33:44] novel netware 3
2021-07-20 11:28:46	yogoyo	[00:34:19] 1 disk missing and you notice near the end of the installation
2021-07-20 11:28:46	yogoyo	[00:34:45] maybe thats where my head is gone missing
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:34:58] Ah yeah, the problem with installing big programs that came in several disks
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Sauvin	[00:35:07] blackgatonegro, the 3.5" floppies had higher densities, 3.5" drives had smaller RW heads, and the whole get-up was a lot more sensitive to bit rot.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:35:11] It was a pain.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:35:50] But before Win95 I usually used small stuff that fit in a single disk so I didn't have to deal with that much.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:37:14] 1 floppy was enough to fit several old DOS games like snake, and.. prehistoric I think?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	iflema	[00:37:32] i got in in 98  some folks couldnt figure out napster so i had a crack :S
2021-07-20 11:28:46	yogoyo	[00:37:59] :D
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:38:57] I remember Windows 98, such a pain. You literally had to reinstall it every few months, win98se was slightly better.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[00:39:45] the tun is tuna
2021-07-20 11:28:46	rascul	[00:40:26] https://www.wired.com/2009/05/five-disk-floppy-raid-4mb-of-blistering-fast-storage/
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:41:13] Anyway the first Linux I used ran inside Windows, it came in a PC mag CD and... at least it booted. Kinda rad for the year 1999.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	rascul	[00:41:46] loadlin.exe existed in 1999
2021-07-20 11:28:46	zjmc_	[00:42:13] cool diskette raid
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:43:32] Anyway I then got Linux on my second desktop in 2008... then after two weeks of dealing with 2008 CemtOs, got the tech guy to install me ubuntu instead.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[00:44:25] tonight on vh1's 'before they were stars'
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:44:49] Still keep using my win98 machine for years, cause games.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:47:01] And then Gnome 3 and Ubuntu Unity dss
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:47:09] desktop happened - -
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:47:10] esselfe: ever get that to work? just curious.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	yogoyo	[00:49:46] blackgatonegro: may i ask you something via private message?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	blackgatonegro	[00:49:58] Go ahead.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:51:30] I can't recall what :P
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:51:49] vnc?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:52:56] man you went far in the backlogs!
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:55:00] I had couple problems tonight
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:55:03] lmao sorry
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:55:10] yeah vnc
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:55:35] oh no, the vnc server works on my laptop but it fails on my tower
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:55:39] i just like to have an idea of what works in case anyone else asks a similar / same question s
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:56:00] still gives you that font error after enabling bitmap fonts?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:56:04] I took the one from realvnc since tightvnc (which they use) doesn't compile
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:56:12] ah
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:56:15] darn
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:56:22] yes, my distro dev say it's not the bitmap thing
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[00:56:40] Anyone here familiar with cameras?  I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to not do... well i think they are doing double encoding, no?  The stream from the camera is encoded, and then decoded by the dvr, and re-encoded... isnt there a way to just raw... well now as i type this i wonder if it can just upload to a share
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:56:55] hmm. i can't imagine what else it could be.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:56:58] he helped me getting it working with 'vncserver -fp /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc'
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:57:22] it's a pretty common issue with software that rely on x's older font infrastructure
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:57:32] fc-list reports lots of fixed fonts
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:57:34] ah
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:57:49] oh good
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[00:58:10] i know most distro's disable them now-a-days so i thought there was a good chance that was the problem
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:58:45] and weirdly /usr/share/fonts/X11 there's only OTF whilst on my laptop it's full of font dirs
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[00:59:06] all the fonts seem in /usr/share/fonts and that fails with -fp
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[01:00:38] look it's all there :) https://termbin.com/vh0k (fc-list | grep -i fixed)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[01:01:52] what does ls -l /etc/fonts/conf.d | grep bitmap look like on either machine?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[01:02:04] yall know if there is a software that will warp a video from fisheye to a specific shape?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[01:02:28] there camera has softawre that lets you view realtime that way but it doesnt actually save video that way
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[01:03:08] tower: https://termbin.com/p11j laptop: https://termbin.com/vlzw
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[01:03:42] it won't be much use doing it once the video has already been captured, would it?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[01:03:50] oh there's no 70-yes-bitmap
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[01:05:06] Some distros annoyingly disable bitmap fonts.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[01:05:11] no it's not that
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[01:05:17] it looks like on this workstation i created individual .conf files to specifically allow certain bitmap fonts to work
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:05:22] `chown user: file` is a shortcut for `chown user:group file` ?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Pentode	[01:05:35] Kyv: yeah very annoyingly.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[01:05:36] Pentode, yeah was thinking that too... hopefully i can just "view" the stream on the dvr and the camera can do the upload of the files
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[01:07:01] was weird 'cause the camera supports h.265 but the software doesnt... so it was uploading and decoding h.265 then saving re-encoded h.264 i think
2021-07-20 11:28:46	curdlesnoot	[01:07:54] bernard__: no
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[01:07:58] oh wait, I should try recompiling font-misc-misc
2021-07-20 11:28:46	akik	[01:08:13] what a time to be alive. ms' linux distro install instructions: https://blog.jreypo.io/2021/07/09/a-look-into-cbl-mariner-microsoft-internal-linux-distribution/
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:08:25] curdlesnoot: why do some people do chown user: alone
2021-07-20 11:28:46	curdlesnoot	[01:08:33] bernard__: actually, yes, sorry. misread.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:08:51] curdlesnoot: you are forgiven my child
2021-07-20 11:28:46	esselfe	[01:09:08] doesn't work
2021-07-20 11:28:46	curdlesnoot	[01:10:04] bernard__: specifically, the primary group, as one would expect.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[01:11:57] good morning
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:12:04] loganlee
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:12:10] oh em geeh
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[01:12:10] hey man
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:12:14] long time
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:14:11] loganlee: you are the language blogs guy right?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[01:14:29] bernard__: nope
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:14:37] oh got confused
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[01:31:04] Anyone know a way to do this in software?  https://snipboard.io/b92CzW.jpg
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[01:36:09] chives: it's in 3D?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	yogoyo	[01:39:12] looks a bit like its taken from the Kerbal Space Program (Game)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[01:39:53] it's just de-fisheye'ing i guess but its doing it specifically on a subset you want to view which is nice, since 40% of that image is uninteresting, you can pick two parts...
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[01:40:06] but its only for temp realtime viewing on the camera when it records its still fisheye
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[01:42:04] chives: https://www.danielplayfaircal.com/blogging/ffmpeg/lensfun/v360/lenscorrection/fisheye/dodgeball/2020/03/24/correcting-lens-distortion-with-ffmpeg.html
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[01:44:00] hmmmmm
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[01:50:18] bernard__, thanks, that is interesting
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:19:06] what if IO was part of the instruction set, maybe as a processor extension (even a microcode one, like one that is handled kernel-side), rather than write/read syscalls?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:19:34] then only 1 syscall would be needed, that would be to open, and the handle given could be used as an 'argument' to IOR/IOW (read and write) as one of the registers
2021-07-20 11:28:46	byte4byte_	[02:19:51] jim i heard C is faster than python is this true?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:19:56] this could also apply for network stuff
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:20:01] do you think this idea is good?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:20:05] NO
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:20:08] err, no
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:20:08] surely someone thought of it before me
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:20:10] byte4byte_: it is tho
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:20:13] ayecee: oh?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:20:30] hmm, alright. I'd love to hear your reasoning :)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:21:04] relies too much on magic
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:21:23] typical murican reasoning :p
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:21:25] a cpu instruction that handles radically different kinds of IO
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:21:26] nah jk
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:21:34] oh uh
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:21:47] no, it just handles the software side of IO rather than requiring a context switch
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:22:05] the kernel would expose a chunk of virtual memory that data can be appended to
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:22:27] okay and then a context switch would happen so the kernel could work on that virtual memory
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:22:56] but at least the context switch wouldn't have to happen right after the instruction
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:23:23] (it'd buffer the virtual memory changes until the kernel got some CPU time, except for IO-intensive programs)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:23:40] whereas write() and read() require an *immediate* context switch by virtue of being a syscall
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:24:57] is that bad
2021-07-20 11:28:46	[[R]]	[02:25:46] 🎶 oh oh... it's magic...
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:26:05] ayecee: yeah, it requires yielding control
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:26:12] okay, is _that_ bad
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:26:16] especially for processes that call write() and read() often, it's quite a bit of redundant overhead
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:26:53] so if a process calls write() and read() *sporadically* and in bursts, these changes shall buffer till X ms have passed
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:27:25] that must be why stdio is buffered already
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:27:39] true, but I don't mean stdio
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:27:51] no, but something that does the same thing
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:27:54] file IO is often buffered (file cache) but this buffering comes after the syscalls so it's not really helpful here
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:28:26] okay like allocating that "virtual memory" is going to involve a context switch too
2021-07-20 11:28:46	 *	rascul [02:28:54] switches the context
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:29:22] either way, if a process calls write() and read() evenly through time, especially one that is seldom on idle sleep, it might be a game or another program that more on IO latency enough to justify the tradeoff of a bit of overhead; there, the special instructions would still apply, but context switching would happen right away, instead of a few cycles down the line
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:29:35] ayecee: it would be done on init. and then sub-allocated by open()
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:29:47] file open or socket open or etc
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:29:50] basically for any FD
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:30:17] on init as in, on spawn()/fork()
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:30:22] so like a fixed allocation of memory for every process
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:30:34] yeah, although it would be sparse
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:30:34] for each fd it could open
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:30:44] okay and what makes it unsparse
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:30:49] suballocation
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:30:52] no
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:30:54] it would be unsparse to a fixed block size
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:31:08] because having to sparsely allocate everytime you write or read something would be antithetic to the goal of not needing syscalls
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:31:12] "sparse" memory, when used, triggers a page fault
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:31:28] that would happen on a file descriptor open
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:31:56] the block size would adjust to the average write/read size between the vmem IO queue flush intervals determined by the aforementioned metric
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:32:10] (where a game would have a lower interval, or even just an immediate flag, for its metric would be more even than sporadic)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:32:49] i can't really follow what your idea is. it seems to be some sort of magic to solve a single problem, "syscalls bad".
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:32:53] running a system update in theb ackground, so everything is slow as heck
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:33:01] ayecee: syscalls are overhead
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:33:12] this is virtual-memory-based syscall deference
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:33:26] which would have its own overhead
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:33:46] yeah but it wouldn't happen all the time
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:34:04] syscalls don't happen all the time either
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:34:05] I think IO overhead is somewhat redundant, at least in terms of how it requires context switching for every single read/write call, it just feels... squanderous to me, but maybe that's just me
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:34:19] i think it is
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:34:35] hm
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:36:15] Gustavo6046: note that a page fault is quite a bit more expensive than a system call, even before you do any page table changes - syscall is a faster context switch instruction than a trap/fault
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:36:29] hmm
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:36:31] fair enough
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:36:36] so instead of sparse memory
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:36:51] and TLB shootdowns are horribly expensive in comparison
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:36:58] Gustavo6046: come on man.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:37:01] Gustavo6046: cut it out.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:37:05] kernel would keep a relational in-memory table of process # | file descriptor | virtual memory location | etc
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:37:27] and the open() sycall would include appending to this table
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:37:36] a close() would remove an item from this table, or just set it vacant
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:38:21] Gustavo6046: that's kinda how it works now, yes
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:38:30] ah
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:38:33] just moving the bones to a different grave
2021-07-20 11:28:46	rascul	[02:38:57] Gustavo6046 maybe look up io_uring
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:39:01] only with a bit more indirection and using the page cache, not just virtual memory
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:39:05] ooh
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:39:07] ring buffers
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:39:09] nnh
2021-07-20 11:28:46	puff	[02:39:22] I need to free up disk space, what's the easiest way to check if a diectory is fully present on my backup drive?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:39:27] uring does nicely solve the 'syscalls are expensive' issue
2021-07-20 11:28:46	puff	[02:39:29] Hm, I guess I could use rsync with dry-run?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:39:30] danieldg: virtual memory would ultimately map into some in-kernel memory
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:39:46] I can't reckon this table being so large as to require swapping, but I guess just in case.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:39:48] puff: worth a try
2021-07-20 11:28:46	puff	[02:39:58] I have a dd backup of a raspberry pi that I need to unzip and dd back onto a raspberry pi, but I don't have enough free disk to unzip it.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:40:18] Gustavo6046: it's called the inode cache, and it doesn't swap - it just gets deleted and can be recreated on demand
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:40:25] ahhh.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:40:36] well, it's a cache though
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:40:54] those entries are kinda important because in my idea they tell where in vmem the kernel lets you write to the IO queues
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:41:15] puff: one would normally unzip it into a pipe into dd instead of writing to disk in between
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:41:21] and the custom kernel microcode would decide whether to syscall write/read right away or defer it
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:41:38] Gustavo6046: yeah, that would be "anywhere in the page cache that corresponds to a file you can write to"
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:41:43] I wonder if two context-switching operations can be batteried together and if that would be benefitting
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:41:53] so if it's going to do a CS anyways might as well do write/read right before that
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:42:07] or if it yields control to another process
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:42:10] (also helps prevent potential race conditions)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:42:11] Gustavo6046: less noise please.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:42:17] um, apologies?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:42:28] i get that you're really excited to hear yourself talk, but it's not so good from this end.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:42:42] you mean I should press enter less often? I hear that often, and I try, I swear
2021-07-20 11:28:46	byte4byte_	[02:42:43] oh shit
2021-07-20 11:28:46	puff	[02:42:50] ayecee: aha, good point, thanks.  I'm a bit brainfried.  Wildfire smoke has made it to my town and it's knocknig me for a loop.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:42:52] no, that's not what i mean
2021-07-20 11:28:46	byte4byte_	[02:42:59] Gustavo6046, you gonna take that?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:43:28] Gustavo6046: you're talking at length about something you barely understand and arguing with people about it.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:43:52] danieldg: but how would the process (or rather, its microcode thingy) know which part of vmem to write to? it's not so much a cache in this case
2021-07-20 11:28:46	byte4byte_	[02:43:58] now he calling you dumb
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:44:07] ayecee: yeah, true, I'm not trying to push anything
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:44:13] although I'm*
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:44:22] i'm not saying you're pushing anything.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:44:23] Gustavo6046: no, this is kernel code
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:44:40] Gustavo6046: you should understand how it works before making changes
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:45:15] eh. maybe not that. making changes would be a way to find out how it works.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:45:29] _talking_ about making changes, not so much
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:45:38] ayecee: ok, point
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:48:08] I don't mean to make changes, but yeah
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:48:20] you should make changes
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:48:26] just maybe someone would be able to concoct a more useful idea from my ramblings :p
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:48:39] not likely
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:49:05] Gustavo6046: the way to make that happen is to build a system with the changes you propose and show it's faster in benchmark X
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:49:24] rather than having it be in kernel, my idea was that the kernel could have its own microcode that slightly alters CPU instructions from executables as they are loaded in order to allow some flexibility in implementing some of the lower level mechanisms that directly involve the code being executed, such as this; for instance, in my idea, it'd replace syscalls to write/read *if* this functionality
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:49:26] was enabled for that process
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:49:31] come on man
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:49:46] you type fast, but maybe type less
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:50:08] Gustavo6046: so, prototype that out
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:50:17] hmm
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:50:24] that sounds scary for some reason
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:50:29] it should
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:50:43] it's a pretty hard process, yep
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[02:50:44] oh my god i'm trying to understand subneting... i haven't got it quite right
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:50:46] can I use qemu to benchmark it?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:50:51] sure
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:50:51] sure
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:50:55] ah
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:51:58] that'll just give you estimates, though; next would be actually getting a processor simulator (say, a riscv one)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:52:41] because you're dealing with timing changes in the nanoseconds
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:52:47] getting a little ahead, i think
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:52:57] but yeah, start with qemu
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:53:10] making it work would already be a huge step
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ayecee	[02:53:30] to put abstract and hazy ramblings into a concrete form
2021-07-20 11:28:46	danieldg	[02:53:34] yeah, qemu is a "see you in a year" type project
2021-07-20 11:28:46	bernard__	[02:58:06] Gustavo6046: como vai
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Gustavo6046	[02:58:16] vou bem, obrigado! :)

2021-07-20 11:28:46	Psi-Jack	[03:39:54] I played the original, and 2 is just as funny, quirky, and good. 🙂
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Psi-Jack	[03:40:28] Though I miss torturing people in the blender. That seems gone in 2.

2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[04:57:17] Izem: did you mean gdisk?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[04:57:28] partition labels usually mean GPT :)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[04:57:34] no, fdisk the command line utility
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[04:57:36] you'll need a partition editor that supports GPT like gdisk or gparted
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[04:57:49] Izem: no: fdisk doesn't support GPT -- it only supports MBR
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[04:57:54] Although fdisk has n (change partition name) in the x (expert menu)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[04:57:57] Izem: and MBR partitions don't have labels
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[04:58:04] oh
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[04:58:11] hmmm
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[04:58:25] Izem: maybe you meant for an ext2/3/4 filesystem label?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[04:58:35] Izem: in this case, you'd use tune2fs
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[04:58:48] fdisk supports GPT. Does not print the labels, however an option to change the name (label) exists in the expert menu. Have never used that (gdisk is so much nicer)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[04:58:55] I'm not sure what the term is, but I used fatlabel to get the effect I wanted
2021-07-20 11:28:46	 *	loganlee [04:59:06] reminisces reiser fs 
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[04:59:38] ah, filesystem label is the term
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[04:59:48] Hmm, that's nice: Work on a computer that has /dev/sdal and is using a font in which you don't know how 1/l look like
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[04:59:54] Izem: ah, yes -- that's a filesystem label -- depends on the filesystem
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:00:10] I remember having issues with some OSes not being able to handle my thumbdrive without the label
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:00:21] Izem: I suggest that you stop using fdisk
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:00:47] Izem: only reason you should be using fdisk is bceause it's the only tool you have access to (which shouldn't be the case in the first place) and you're maintaining an old legacy system
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:00:57] I'm currently trying to figure out why this device only shows up in the dolphin file manager and not in "disks & devices"
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:01:03] on a kde desktop
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[05:01:04] GPT on thumb drives may be odd and less portable (particularly to semi-archaic systems)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:01:28] mlu yes you guessed right again :P
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:01:43] though I'm not on a legacy system
2021-07-20 11:28:46	iflema	[05:02:05] mlu: what OS are you on and is it 15 years old?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	iflema	[05:02:12] the install
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:02:24] hah, it better be 15yo if it has fdisk but not gdisk :P
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:02:38] and if it's 15yo, that's a hella legacy system
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:02:41] it does have cfdisk
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:02:45] no, that doesn't count :P
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:02:55] cfdisk was fun in the days, but you really need gdisk or gparted
2021-07-20 11:28:46	 *	mlu [05:03:12] double-checks busybox for gdisk presence
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:03:15] was reiser fs revolutionary in its day?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:03:29] I'm also curious as to why fdisk seems to have C/H/S output displayed?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:03:30] or even gptfdisk?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[05:03:36] gdisk, cgdisk and sgdisk are not usually installed by default on any distro, and fdisk/cfdisk/sfdisk work with GPT (have not actually trying sfdisk there)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:03:37] loganlee: it felt revolutionary back in the day
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:03:48] loganlee: however, as I learned a bit more about filesystem,s I learned why it was fast
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:04:06] loganlee: long story short, reiserfs gained speed by skipping a lot of prudent safety mechanisms
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:04:15] :O
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:04:19] his filesystem respected your data pretty much as much as he respected life: not much
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:04:29] mlu: ok...
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:04:30] oof
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:04:59] that would explain all the horror stories with reiserfsck, etc.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:05:14] and to his credit, the filesystem was fast -- just make sure you have good backups
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:05:20] but then again, you could just use ext3 without journaling
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:05:29] what filesystem are you using for your Linux setup?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:05:38] these days, I use ext4 -- it's fast and good enough
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:05:56] i juse use ext4 because it sound like new
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:05:59] also, I have NVMe SSDs these days -- they're literally faster than ramdisks of yesteryear
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:06:06] yeah, I'm interested in btrfs because of it's snapshot ability
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:06:08] ext4's a good fs -- why not?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[05:06:09] The horror stories with reiserfsck mainly result from the rebuild tree image vulnerability, otherwise reiserfs is quite robust and the rebuild tree makes it able to recover from failures other filesystems wouldn't
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:06:25] it's fast if it does what you need -- but if you need snapshotting or other fun stuff, btrfs and ZFS are great options
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:06:45] ZFS seems weird outside of *BSD
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:06:57] is ZFS on Linux still progressing?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:07:05] it's usable
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[05:07:15] Izem: Only because it's weird in itself, ZFS on Linux is quite fine. And is OpenZFS upstream now.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:07:15] but I personally ask myself: why?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	arcturus	[05:07:31] i prefer btrfs
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:07:32] if I needed snapshotting and all of that fancy stuff, there's probably a SAN handling it
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:07:35] and I'd just export NFS from there
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:07:41] maybe SMB too if I have any Windows clients
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:07:59] just remember: ext4 is much faster if you don't need any of the fancy stuff
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:08:07] Have you tried to experiment the network storage using 9fs?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:08:23] v9fs in Linux is slow as molasses though
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:08:39] I'm really interested in why :)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	paulcarroty	[05:09:45] hey, please report this man on github: https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5#issuecomment-882516952 'cause threatening open source developers isn't acceptable.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:10:04] mlu I don't think I need snapshotting, that would be the easy way out of my (development) troubles though
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:10:56] Izem: if you just need a solid filesystem that works, use ext4
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:11:25] they got rid of that annoying lost+found :)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:11:38] oh really? that must be recent then
2021-07-20 11:28:46	 *	Izem [05:11:43] checks
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:11:52] Izem: hmm, ext4's been available for a decade already
2021-07-20 11:28:46	rindolf	[05:12:01] paulcarroty: a hoax - the .cn government are good people
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:12:31] Izem: you sure you didn't miss the last 15yr in a time machine?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:12:35] I still see lost+found on my ext4 system, how do I check the version?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:12:46] Izem: you probably migrated from ext3 or ran a fsck
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:13:12] Is this what we are calling a LTS system these days? :P
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:13:46] LTS is usually suported for only 3yr afaik
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:14:37] i'm using ubuntu LTS. can i upgrade to a newer LTS when it is available?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:15:05] :-O
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:15:16] yeah, should be possible
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:15:31] ubuntu extended their LTS support iirc
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Psi-Jack	[05:15:32] mlu: Which LTS are you referring to?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:15:41] yay
2021-07-20 11:28:46	mlu	[05:16:02] Psi-Jack: most LTSes in general -- Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Psi-Jack	[05:16:27] Then, that's very wrong. Definitely has been historically longer than 3 years.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:17:28] from memory ubuntu 20.4.1 lts is for five years?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Guest76	[05:17:37] Debian is using anchient lxde
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Guest76	[05:17:54] debian looks like 2007 linux
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Guest76	[05:17:55] i like it
2021-07-20 11:28:46	paulcarroty	[05:18:10] rindolf: sure, uighurs can approve it.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[05:18:33] paulcarroty: Wow, aside from going out of their way to look really bad, the Muse Group certainly seem clueless about how anything works.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:19:22] loganlee: yeah
2021-07-20 11:28:46	rindolf	[05:21:44] paulcarroty: what?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[05:21:50] hexnewbie: what are they supposed to have done now? I think the ignorance defense is kind of worn thin at this point.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Psi-Jack	[05:22:15] 3 years full support, 3 more years maintenance, then 3 more years extended security updates (for customers). Is the Ubuntu LTS. CentOS LTS, well, that's pretty much gone with CentOS 8.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	rindolf	[05:22:33] hexnewbie: much ado about nothing
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Psi-Jack	[05:22:45] Oh, and the extended security is now longer than it was back from 14.04 and 16.04.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[05:22:51] Kyv: Threatened the maintainer of a fork of MuseScore with a deportation them to China and what the Chinese government would do to them
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[05:23:51] Ignorance not being a defence, but there's certainly a lot of it involved.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[05:29:07] The last I checked on anything related, the dev of that Audacity fork appeared to be having some kind of public nervous breakdown.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[05:29:19] Kind of tedious to get the context out of these things
2021-07-20 11:28:46	paulcarroty	[05:31:09] audacity fork in development now
2021-07-20 11:28:46	evilscreww	[05:31:19] thank god
2021-07-20 11:28:46	 *	evilscreww [05:31:53] gets on his knees, kisses the ground and yells at the top of his lungs "Hallelujah"
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Guest76	[05:33:04] Fork for linux?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	hexnewbie	[05:33:27] Buying a FOSS project than blatantly losing all the trust of the community: Always a good move.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	evilscreww	[05:34:19] guys im a debian man.

2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:36:36] Can you dd a SD card?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	evilscreww	[05:37:45] brb, gotta reboot my sheet
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:37:46] I want to get an rpi img on an SD card and I suspect this would work.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:41:01] When did proc get in Linux? Was it around 2.6?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:41:55] Izem, dont see why not
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:42:19] great
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:42:25] if / of
2021-07-20 11:28:46	evilscreww	[05:43:13] suggestion for any debian devs out there. make a "your phone" equivalent for linux deb
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:43:18] https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:45:11] So if you're wanting to start building out a basic secure network at home from windows side... im guessing samba is probably a good firstish item on the list?  Seems like the computer problems always end up with i just need one more computer... what is a good first at home... architecture?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:45:32] so you start off basically as basic as possible... windows workstation and windows server
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:45:51] windows server?!
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:45:59] at home? :D
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:46:00] yeah thats my problem... i dont trust it
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:46:14] so you have to separate them with non-windows
2021-07-20 11:28:46	jessicara	[05:46:22] think a lot of people use a seperate machine as a firewall
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:47:26] Izem, problem is it seems windows is a great hardware os drivers wise
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:47:40] go on
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:47:46] i liked windows 96
2021-07-20 11:28:46	loganlee	[05:47:52] windows 95
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:48:26] you sound like you are making something interesting
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:48:43] no not really i think i have rootkits on all my stuff so
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:49:06] why?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:49:15] actually, don't answer that
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Izem	[05:49:34] but anyways, is it to much for a reinstall?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:49:34] ha not even going down tinfoil (yet)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:51:03] izem: probably is end state for next beginning but thats why am asking trying to get an idea for the plan
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:52:11] my model right now is my workstation is the badness box since it has direct internet access and my "server" is the protected box
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[05:53:06] get into the badness box
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:53:09] so where do you go after that to make sure they are both as protected as possible from each other while still allowing...
2021-07-20 11:28:46	 *	Kyv [05:53:18] wags finger at chives 
2021-07-20 11:28:46	jessicara	[05:53:44] kinda hard to get any important files off things like that
2021-07-20 11:28:46	jessicara	[05:54:11] i remember using discs because the disc itself had no firmware to do such
2021-07-20 11:28:46	john_rambo	[05:54:35] I just installed Librewolf for the first time ..... I cant save passwords & if I close the browser all my active logins are gone & I have login all over again ....I need to stay logged in to a lot of sites ....(a) Whats the resoan behind this policy & (b) if you are using librewolf how do you manage ?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[05:55:18] what did you expect?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:55:20] that is the problem no matter the tech ill end up ill prob end up being the infector
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[05:56:48] john_rambo: go into preferences and change your history settings
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Kyv	[05:57:58] or dont use a browser geared toward privacy, as its going to clear everything when it closes.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:58:24] first thing is.. so if im just direct transfering via smb... am wondering if samba might be a better option somehow? in terms of placing in a kerberous domain?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chives	[05:58:35] kerberos

2021-07-20 11:29:01	 *	yogoyo [00:16:55] installs supertuxkart just in case
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[00:17:06] yogoyo: further, you want the sshd instance to actually exit.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:19:48] curdlesnoot: it would unnecessarily bind resources or would there be another problem when that sshd instance does not quit?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:20:28] with fedora i get a new kernel every 1-2 days. so i need to reboot anyways
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[00:21:13] yogoyo: as noted by the article, sshd will never observe eof.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:23:45] Hello People
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:25:09] curdlesnoot: what would you write as tag line for a todo list? "inter process communication" or something like that?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:25:52] Been reading some old PC mags; wow how things have changed. To start PC mags were a thing.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[00:26:23] yogoyo: you mean, as concerns this topic? yes, it falls under the issue of inter-process communication (not least, as pipes are involved).
2021-07-20 11:29:01	iflema	[00:26:40] blackgatonegro: yeah they had dvd on the cover
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:26:49] Installing Linux was an Oddisey, Windows wasn't spyware, and  so on.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:26:52] curdlesnoot: heh, and without the help of pipes?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[00:27:14] yogoyo: only in the loosest sense. but I would still say yes.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:27:48] iflema try floppies
2021-07-20 11:29:01	iflema	[00:28:10] I used to like mikes 10 billion distros in one dvd with menu
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:28:28] I still have a few old pc mags that cane with floppies; dunno were the heck the floppies ended.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:28:52] *came
2021-07-20 11:29:01	iflema	[00:28:59] blackgatonegro: 26 of em
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:29:23] floppies needed no "sync" like usb pendrives. you could follow the sound of the drive
2021-07-20 11:29:01	iflema	[00:29:29] i couldnt hadle floppies alway a few duds in the set
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:29:30] But mostly I remember when PC mags started to include CDs with demos and shareware, fub times.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	iflema	[00:29:41] speakers and microwaves and whatever
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:30:07] Nah back in the early 90s floppies actually were of good quality.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:30:45] They also weren't cheap.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:31:03] the 5,25" ones were bad
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:31:52] Actually flat floppies ended lasting me more for some reason, you just had to you know; be careful handling them.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[00:32:18] not all drives were manufactured equal, for that matter. I recall once testing a pile of floppy drives with a DOS utility whose name now escapes me.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:32:31] It was like handling something made of crystal, be slow and careful and they lasted a lot.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[00:32:39] it helped me select the one that was most reliably able to deal with novel formats.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:33:35] While I started with DOS by the time I had my own computer, it came with Windows 95 .
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:33:44] novel netware 3
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:34:19] 1 disk missing and you notice near the end of the installation
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:34:45] maybe thats where my head is gone missing
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:34:58] Ah yeah, the problem with installing big programs that came in several disks
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Sauvin	[00:35:07] blackgatonegro, the 3.5" floppies had higher densities, 3.5" drives had smaller RW heads, and the whole get-up was a lot more sensitive to bit rot.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:35:11] It was a pain.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:35:50] But before Win95 I usually used small stuff that fit in a single disk so I didn't have to deal with that much.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:37:14] 1 floppy was enough to fit several old DOS games like snake, and.. prehistoric I think?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	iflema	[00:37:32] i got in in 98  some folks couldnt figure out napster so i had a crack :S
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:37:59] :D
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:38:57] I remember Windows 98, such a pain. You literally had to reinstall it every few months, win98se was slightly better.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[00:39:45] the tun is tuna
2021-07-20 11:29:01	rascul	[00:40:26] https://www.wired.com/2009/05/five-disk-floppy-raid-4mb-of-blistering-fast-storage/
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:41:13] Anyway the first Linux I used ran inside Windows, it came in a PC mag CD and... at least it booted. Kinda rad for the year 1999.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	rascul	[00:41:46] loadlin.exe existed in 1999
2021-07-20 11:29:01	zjmc_	[00:42:13] cool diskette raid
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:43:32] Anyway I then got Linux on my second desktop in 2008... then after two weeks of dealing with 2008 CemtOs, got the tech guy to install me ubuntu instead.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[00:44:25] tonight on vh1's 'before they were stars'
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:44:49] Still keep using my win98 machine for years, cause games.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:47:01] And then Gnome 3 and Ubuntu Unity dss
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:47:09] desktop happened - -
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:47:10] esselfe: ever get that to work? just curious.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[00:49:46] blackgatonegro: may i ask you something via private message?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	blackgatonegro	[00:49:58] Go ahead.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:51:30] I can't recall what :P
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:51:49] vnc?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:52:56] man you went far in the backlogs!
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:55:00] I had couple problems tonight
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:55:03] lmao sorry
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:55:10] yeah vnc
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:55:35] oh no, the vnc server works on my laptop but it fails on my tower
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:55:39] i just like to have an idea of what works in case anyone else asks a similar / same question s
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:56:00] still gives you that font error after enabling bitmap fonts?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:56:04] I took the one from realvnc since tightvnc (which they use) doesn't compile
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:56:12] ah
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:56:15] darn
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:56:22] yes, my distro dev say it's not the bitmap thing
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[00:56:40] Anyone here familiar with cameras?  I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to not do... well i think they are doing double encoding, no?  The stream from the camera is encoded, and then decoded by the dvr, and re-encoded... isnt there a way to just raw... well now as i type this i wonder if it can just upload to a share
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:56:55] hmm. i can't imagine what else it could be.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:56:58] he helped me getting it working with 'vncserver -fp /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc'
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:57:22] it's a pretty common issue with software that rely on x's older font infrastructure
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:57:32] fc-list reports lots of fixed fonts
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:57:34] ah
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:57:49] oh good
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[00:58:10] i know most distro's disable them now-a-days so i thought there was a good chance that was the problem
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:58:45] and weirdly /usr/share/fonts/X11 there's only OTF whilst on my laptop it's full of font dirs
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[00:59:06] all the fonts seem in /usr/share/fonts and that fails with -fp
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[01:00:38] look it's all there :) https://termbin.com/vh0k (fc-list | grep -i fixed)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[01:01:52] what does ls -l /etc/fonts/conf.d | grep bitmap look like on either machine?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[01:02:04] yall know if there is a software that will warp a video from fisheye to a specific shape?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[01:02:28] there camera has softawre that lets you view realtime that way but it doesnt actually save video that way
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[01:03:08] tower: https://termbin.com/p11j laptop: https://termbin.com/vlzw
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[01:03:42] it won't be much use doing it once the video has already been captured, would it?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[01:03:50] oh there's no 70-yes-bitmap
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[01:05:06] Some distros annoyingly disable bitmap fonts.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[01:05:11] no it's not that
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[01:05:17] it looks like on this workstation i created individual .conf files to specifically allow certain bitmap fonts to work
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:05:22] `chown user: file` is a shortcut for `chown user:group file` ?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Pentode	[01:05:35] Kyv: yeah very annoyingly.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[01:05:36] Pentode, yeah was thinking that too... hopefully i can just "view" the stream on the dvr and the camera can do the upload of the files
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[01:07:01] was weird 'cause the camera supports h.265 but the software doesnt... so it was uploading and decoding h.265 then saving re-encoded h.264 i think
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[01:07:54] bernard__: no
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[01:07:58] oh wait, I should try recompiling font-misc-misc
2021-07-20 11:29:01	akik	[01:08:13] what a time to be alive. ms' linux distro install instructions: https://blog.jreypo.io/2021/07/09/a-look-into-cbl-mariner-microsoft-internal-linux-distribution/
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:08:25] curdlesnoot: why do some people do chown user: alone
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[01:08:33] bernard__: actually, yes, sorry. misread.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:08:51] curdlesnoot: you are forgiven my child
2021-07-20 11:29:01	esselfe	[01:09:08] doesn't work
2021-07-20 11:29:01	curdlesnoot	[01:10:04] bernard__: specifically, the primary group, as one would expect.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[01:11:57] good morning
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:12:04] loganlee
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:12:10] oh em geeh
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[01:12:10] hey man
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:12:14] long time
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:14:11] loganlee: you are the language blogs guy right?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[01:14:29] bernard__: nope
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:14:37] oh got confused
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[01:31:04] Anyone know a way to do this in software?  https://snipboard.io/b92CzW.jpg
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[01:36:09] chives: it's in 3D?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	yogoyo	[01:39:12] looks a bit like its taken from the Kerbal Space Program (Game)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[01:39:53] it's just de-fisheye'ing i guess but its doing it specifically on a subset you want to view which is nice, since 40% of that image is uninteresting, you can pick two parts...
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[01:40:06] but its only for temp realtime viewing on the camera when it records its still fisheye
2021-07-20 11:29:01	bernard__	[01:42:04] chives: https://www.danielplayfaircal.com/blogging/ffmpeg/lensfun/v360/lenscorrection/fisheye/dodgeball/2020/03/24/correcting-lens-distortion-with-ffmpeg.html
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[01:44:00] hmmmmm
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[01:50:18] bernard__, thanks, that is interesting
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:19:06] what if IO was part of the instruction set, maybe as a processor extension (even a microcode one, like one that is handled kernel-side), rather than write/read syscalls?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:19:34] then only 1 syscall would be needed, that would be to open, and the handle given could be used as an 'argument' to IOR/IOW (read and write) as one of the registers
2021-07-20 11:29:01	byte4byte_	[02:19:51] jim i heard C is faster than python is this true?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:19:56] this could also apply for network stuff
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:20:01] do you think this idea is good?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:20:05] NO
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:20:08] err, no
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:20:08] surely someone thought of it before me
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:20:10] byte4byte_: it is tho
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:20:13] ayecee: oh?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:20:30] hmm, alright. I'd love to hear your reasoning :)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:21:04] relies too much on magic
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:21:23] typical murican reasoning :p
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:21:25] a cpu instruction that handles radically different kinds of IO
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:21:26] nah jk
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:21:34] oh uh
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:21:47] no, it just handles the software side of IO rather than requiring a context switch
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:22:05] the kernel would expose a chunk of virtual memory that data can be appended to
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:22:27] okay and then a context switch would happen so the kernel could work on that virtual memory
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:22:56] but at least the context switch wouldn't have to happen right after the instruction
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:23:23] (it'd buffer the virtual memory changes until the kernel got some CPU time, except for IO-intensive programs)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:23:40] whereas write() and read() require an *immediate* context switch by virtue of being a syscall
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:24:57] is that bad
2021-07-20 11:29:01	[[R]]	[02:25:46] 🎶 oh oh... it's magic...
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:26:05] ayecee: yeah, it requires yielding control
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:26:12] okay, is _that_ bad
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:26:16] especially for processes that call write() and read() often, it's quite a bit of redundant overhead
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:26:53] so if a process calls write() and read() *sporadically* and in bursts, these changes shall buffer till X ms have passed
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:27:25] that must be why stdio is buffered already
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:27:39] true, but I don't mean stdio
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:27:51] no, but something that does the same thing
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:27:54] file IO is often buffered (file cache) but this buffering comes after the syscalls so it's not really helpful here
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:28:26] okay like allocating that "virtual memory" is going to involve a context switch too
2021-07-20 11:29:01	 *	rascul [02:28:54] switches the context
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:29:22] either way, if a process calls write() and read() evenly through time, especially one that is seldom on idle sleep, it might be a game or another program that more on IO latency enough to justify the tradeoff of a bit of overhead; there, the special instructions would still apply, but context switching would happen right away, instead of a few cycles down the line
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:29:35] ayecee: it would be done on init. and then sub-allocated by open()
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:29:47] file open or socket open or etc
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:29:50] basically for any FD
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:30:17] on init as in, on spawn()/fork()
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:30:22] so like a fixed allocation of memory for every process
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:30:34] yeah, although it would be sparse
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:30:34] for each fd it could open
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:30:44] okay and what makes it unsparse
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:30:49] suballocation
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:30:52] no
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:30:54] it would be unsparse to a fixed block size
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:31:08] because having to sparsely allocate everytime you write or read something would be antithetic to the goal of not needing syscalls
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:31:12] "sparse" memory, when used, triggers a page fault
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:31:28] that would happen on a file descriptor open
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:31:56] the block size would adjust to the average write/read size between the vmem IO queue flush intervals determined by the aforementioned metric
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:32:10] (where a game would have a lower interval, or even just an immediate flag, for its metric would be more even than sporadic)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:32:49] i can't really follow what your idea is. it seems to be some sort of magic to solve a single problem, "syscalls bad".
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:32:53] running a system update in theb ackground, so everything is slow as heck
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:33:01] ayecee: syscalls are overhead
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:33:12] this is virtual-memory-based syscall deference
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:33:26] which would have its own overhead
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:33:46] yeah but it wouldn't happen all the time
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:34:04] syscalls don't happen all the time either
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:34:05] I think IO overhead is somewhat redundant, at least in terms of how it requires context switching for every single read/write call, it just feels... squanderous to me, but maybe that's just me
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:34:19] i think it is
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:34:35] hm
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:36:15] Gustavo6046: note that a page fault is quite a bit more expensive than a system call, even before you do any page table changes - syscall is a faster context switch instruction than a trap/fault
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:36:29] hmm
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:36:31] fair enough
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:36:36] so instead of sparse memory
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:36:51] and TLB shootdowns are horribly expensive in comparison
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:36:58] Gustavo6046: come on man.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:37:01] Gustavo6046: cut it out.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:37:05] kernel would keep a relational in-memory table of process # | file descriptor | virtual memory location | etc
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:37:27] and the open() sycall would include appending to this table
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:37:36] a close() would remove an item from this table, or just set it vacant
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:38:21] Gustavo6046: that's kinda how it works now, yes
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:38:30] ah
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:38:33] just moving the bones to a different grave
2021-07-20 11:29:01	rascul	[02:38:57] Gustavo6046 maybe look up io_uring
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:39:01] only with a bit more indirection and using the page cache, not just virtual memory
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:39:05] ooh
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:39:07] ring buffers
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:39:09] nnh
2021-07-20 11:29:01	puff	[02:39:22] I need to free up disk space, what's the easiest way to check if a diectory is fully present on my backup drive?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:39:27] uring does nicely solve the 'syscalls are expensive' issue
2021-07-20 11:29:01	puff	[02:39:29] Hm, I guess I could use rsync with dry-run?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:39:30] danieldg: virtual memory would ultimately map into some in-kernel memory
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:39:46] I can't reckon this table being so large as to require swapping, but I guess just in case.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:39:48] puff: worth a try
2021-07-20 11:29:01	puff	[02:39:58] I have a dd backup of a raspberry pi that I need to unzip and dd back onto a raspberry pi, but I don't have enough free disk to unzip it.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:40:18] Gustavo6046: it's called the inode cache, and it doesn't swap - it just gets deleted and can be recreated on demand
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:40:25] ahhh.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:40:36] well, it's a cache though
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:40:54] those entries are kinda important because in my idea they tell where in vmem the kernel lets you write to the IO queues
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:41:15] puff: one would normally unzip it into a pipe into dd instead of writing to disk in between
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:41:21] and the custom kernel microcode would decide whether to syscall write/read right away or defer it
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:41:38] Gustavo6046: yeah, that would be "anywhere in the page cache that corresponds to a file you can write to"
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:41:43] I wonder if two context-switching operations can be batteried together and if that would be benefitting
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:41:53] so if it's going to do a CS anyways might as well do write/read right before that
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:42:07] or if it yields control to another process
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:42:10] (also helps prevent potential race conditions)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:42:11] Gustavo6046: less noise please.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:42:17] um, apologies?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:42:28] i get that you're really excited to hear yourself talk, but it's not so good from this end.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:42:42] you mean I should press enter less often? I hear that often, and I try, I swear
2021-07-20 11:29:01	byte4byte_	[02:42:43] oh shit
2021-07-20 11:29:01	puff	[02:42:50] ayecee: aha, good point, thanks.  I'm a bit brainfried.  Wildfire smoke has made it to my town and it's knocknig me for a loop.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:42:52] no, that's not what i mean
2021-07-20 11:29:01	byte4byte_	[02:42:59] Gustavo6046, you gonna take that?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:43:28] Gustavo6046: you're talking at length about something you barely understand and arguing with people about it.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:43:52] danieldg: but how would the process (or rather, its microcode thingy) know which part of vmem to write to? it's not so much a cache in this case
2021-07-20 11:29:01	byte4byte_	[02:43:58] now he calling you dumb
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:44:07] ayecee: yeah, true, I'm not trying to push anything
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:44:13] although I'm*
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:44:22] i'm not saying you're pushing anything.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:44:23] Gustavo6046: no, this is kernel code
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:44:40] Gustavo6046: you should understand how it works before making changes
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:45:15] eh. maybe not that. making changes would be a way to find out how it works.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:45:29] _talking_ about making changes, not so much
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:45:38] ayecee: ok, point
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:48:08] I don't mean to make changes, but yeah
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:48:20] you should make changes
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:48:26] just maybe someone would be able to concoct a more useful idea from my ramblings :p
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:48:39] not likely
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:49:05] Gustavo6046: the way to make that happen is to build a system with the changes you propose and show it's faster in benchmark X
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:49:24] rather than having it be in kernel, my idea was that the kernel could have its own microcode that slightly alters CPU instructions from executables as they are loaded in order to allow some flexibility in implementing some of the lower level mechanisms that directly involve the code being executed, such as this; for instance, in my idea, it'd replace syscalls to write/read *if* this functionality
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:49:26] was enabled for that process
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:49:31] come on man
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:49:46] you type fast, but maybe type less
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:50:08] Gustavo6046: so, prototype that out
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:50:17] hmm
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:50:24] that sounds scary for some reason
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:50:29] it should
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:50:43] it's a pretty hard process, yep
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[02:50:44] oh my god i'm trying to understand subneting... i haven't got it quite right
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:50:46] can I use qemu to benchmark it?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:50:51] sure
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:50:51] sure
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Gustavo6046	[02:50:55] ah
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:51:58] that'll just give you estimates, though; next would be actually getting a processor simulator (say, a riscv one)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:52:41] because you're dealing with timing changes in the nanoseconds
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:52:47] getting a little ahead, i think
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:52:57] but yeah, start with qemu
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:53:10] making it work would already be a huge step
2021-07-20 11:29:01	ayecee	[02:53:30] to put abstract and hazy ramblings into a concrete form
2021-07-20 11:29:01	danieldg	[02:53:34] yeah, qemu is a "see you in a year" type project

2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[04:55:57] Can I give a partition a label using fdisk (util-linux)?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:57:08] Izem: you can't -- fdisk doesn't support that
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[04:57:17] Izem: You can with gdisk
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:57:17] Izem: did you mean gdisk?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:57:28] partition labels usually mean GPT :)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[04:57:34] no, fdisk the command line utility
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:57:36] you'll need a partition editor that supports GPT like gdisk or gparted
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:57:49] Izem: no: fdisk doesn't support GPT -- it only supports MBR
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[04:57:54] Although fdisk has n (change partition name) in the x (expert menu)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:57:57] Izem: and MBR partitions don't have labels
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[04:58:04] oh
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[04:58:11] hmmm
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:58:25] Izem: maybe you meant for an ext2/3/4 filesystem label?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:58:35] Izem: in this case, you'd use tune2fs
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[04:58:48] fdisk supports GPT. Does not print the labels, however an option to change the name (label) exists in the expert menu. Have never used that (gdisk is so much nicer)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[04:58:55] I'm not sure what the term is, but I used fatlabel to get the effect I wanted
2021-07-20 11:29:01	 *	loganlee [04:59:06] reminisces reiser fs 
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[04:59:38] ah, filesystem label is the term
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[04:59:48] Hmm, that's nice: Work on a computer that has /dev/sdal and is using a font in which you don't know how 1/l look like
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[04:59:54] Izem: ah, yes -- that's a filesystem label -- depends on the filesystem
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:00:10] I remember having issues with some OSes not being able to handle my thumbdrive without the label
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:00:21] Izem: I suggest that you stop using fdisk
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:00:47] Izem: only reason you should be using fdisk is bceause it's the only tool you have access to (which shouldn't be the case in the first place) and you're maintaining an old legacy system
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:00:57] I'm currently trying to figure out why this device only shows up in the dolphin file manager and not in "disks & devices"
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:01:03] on a kde desktop
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[05:01:04] GPT on thumb drives may be odd and less portable (particularly to semi-archaic systems)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:01:28] mlu yes you guessed right again :P
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:01:43] though I'm not on a legacy system
2021-07-20 11:29:01	iflema	[05:02:05] mlu: what OS are you on and is it 15 years old?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	iflema	[05:02:12] the install
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:02:24] hah, it better be 15yo if it has fdisk but not gdisk :P
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:02:38] and if it's 15yo, that's a hella legacy system
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:02:41] it does have cfdisk
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:02:45] no, that doesn't count :P
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:02:55] cfdisk was fun in the days, but you really need gdisk or gparted
2021-07-20 11:29:01	 *	mlu [05:03:12] double-checks busybox for gdisk presence
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:03:15] was reiser fs revolutionary in its day?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:03:29] I'm also curious as to why fdisk seems to have C/H/S output displayed?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:03:30] or even gptfdisk?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[05:03:36] gdisk, cgdisk and sgdisk are not usually installed by default on any distro, and fdisk/cfdisk/sfdisk work with GPT (have not actually trying sfdisk there)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:03:37] loganlee: it felt revolutionary back in the day
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:03:48] loganlee: however, as I learned a bit more about filesystem,s I learned why it was fast
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:04:06] loganlee: long story short, reiserfs gained speed by skipping a lot of prudent safety mechanisms
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:04:15] :O
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:04:19] his filesystem respected your data pretty much as much as he respected life: not much
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:04:29] mlu: ok...
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:04:30] oof
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:04:59] that would explain all the horror stories with reiserfsck, etc.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:05:14] and to his credit, the filesystem was fast -- just make sure you have good backups
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:05:20] but then again, you could just use ext3 without journaling
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:05:29] what filesystem are you using for your Linux setup?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:05:38] these days, I use ext4 -- it's fast and good enough
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:05:56] i juse use ext4 because it sound like new
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:05:59] also, I have NVMe SSDs these days -- they're literally faster than ramdisks of yesteryear
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:06:06] yeah, I'm interested in btrfs because of it's snapshot ability
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:06:08] ext4's a good fs -- why not?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[05:06:09] The horror stories with reiserfsck mainly result from the rebuild tree image vulnerability, otherwise reiserfs is quite robust and the rebuild tree makes it able to recover from failures other filesystems wouldn't
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:06:25] it's fast if it does what you need -- but if you need snapshotting or other fun stuff, btrfs and ZFS are great options
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:06:45] ZFS seems weird outside of *BSD
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:06:57] is ZFS on Linux still progressing?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:07:05] it's usable
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[05:07:15] Izem: Only because it's weird in itself, ZFS on Linux is quite fine. And is OpenZFS upstream now.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:07:15] but I personally ask myself: why?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	arcturus	[05:07:31] i prefer btrfs
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:07:32] if I needed snapshotting and all of that fancy stuff, there's probably a SAN handling it
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:07:35] and I'd just export NFS from there
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:07:41] maybe SMB too if I have any Windows clients
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:07:59] just remember: ext4 is much faster if you don't need any of the fancy stuff
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:08:07] Have you tried to experiment the network storage using 9fs?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:08:23] v9fs in Linux is slow as molasses though
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:08:39] I'm really interested in why :)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	paulcarroty	[05:09:45] hey, please report this man on github: https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5#issuecomment-882516952 'cause threatening open source developers isn't acceptable.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:10:04] mlu I don't think I need snapshotting, that would be the easy way out of my (development) troubles though
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:10:56] Izem: if you just need a solid filesystem that works, use ext4
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:11:25] they got rid of that annoying lost+found :)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:11:38] oh really? that must be recent then
2021-07-20 11:29:01	 *	Izem [05:11:43] checks
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:11:52] Izem: hmm, ext4's been available for a decade already
2021-07-20 11:29:01	rindolf	[05:12:01] paulcarroty: a hoax - the .cn government are good people
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:12:31] Izem: you sure you didn't miss the last 15yr in a time machine?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:12:35] I still see lost+found on my ext4 system, how do I check the version?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:12:46] Izem: you probably migrated from ext3 or ran a fsck
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:13:12] Is this what we are calling a LTS system these days? :P
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:13:46] LTS is usually suported for only 3yr afaik
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:14:37] i'm using ubuntu LTS. can i upgrade to a newer LTS when it is available?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:15:05] :-O
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:15:16] yeah, should be possible
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:15:31] ubuntu extended their LTS support iirc
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Psi-Jack	[05:15:32] mlu: Which LTS are you referring to?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:15:41] yay
2021-07-20 11:29:01	mlu	[05:16:02] Psi-Jack: most LTSes in general -- Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Psi-Jack	[05:16:27] Then, that's very wrong. Definitely has been historically longer than 3 years.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:17:28] from memory ubuntu 20.4.1 lts is for five years?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Guest76	[05:17:37] Debian is using anchient lxde
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Guest76	[05:17:54] debian looks like 2007 linux
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Guest76	[05:17:55] i like it
2021-07-20 11:29:01	paulcarroty	[05:18:10] rindolf: sure, uighurs can approve it.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[05:18:33] paulcarroty: Wow, aside from going out of their way to look really bad, the Muse Group certainly seem clueless about how anything works.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:19:22] loganlee: yeah
2021-07-20 11:29:01	rindolf	[05:21:44] paulcarroty: what?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[05:21:50] hexnewbie: what are they supposed to have done now? I think the ignorance defense is kind of worn thin at this point.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Psi-Jack	[05:22:15] 3 years full support, 3 more years maintenance, then 3 more years extended security updates (for customers). Is the Ubuntu LTS. CentOS LTS, well, that's pretty much gone with CentOS 8.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	rindolf	[05:22:33] hexnewbie: much ado about nothing
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Psi-Jack	[05:22:45] Oh, and the extended security is now longer than it was back from 14.04 and 16.04.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[05:22:51] Kyv: Threatened the maintainer of a fork of MuseScore with a deportation them to China and what the Chinese government would do to them
2021-07-20 11:29:01	hexnewbie	[05:23:51] Ignorance not being a defence, but there's certainly a lot of it involved.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[05:29:07] The last I checked on anything related, the dev of that Audacity fork appeared to be having some kind of public nervous breakdown.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[05:29:19] Kind of tedious to get the context out of these things

2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:45:11] So if you're wanting to start building out a basic secure network at home from windows side... im guessing samba is probably a good firstish item on the list?  Seems like the computer problems always end up with i just need one more computer... what is a good first at home... architecture?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:45:32] so you start off basically as basic as possible... windows workstation and windows server
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:45:51] windows server?!
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:45:59] at home? :D
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:46:00] yeah thats my problem... i dont trust it
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:46:14] so you have to separate them with non-windows
2021-07-20 11:29:01	jessicara	[05:46:22] think a lot of people use a seperate machine as a firewall
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:47:26] Izem, problem is it seems windows is a great hardware os drivers wise
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:47:40] go on
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:47:46] i liked windows 96
2021-07-20 11:29:01	loganlee	[05:47:52] windows 95
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:48:26] you sound like you are making something interesting
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:48:43] no not really i think i have rootkits on all my stuff so
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:49:06] why?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:49:15] actually, don't answer that
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Izem	[05:49:34] but anyways, is it to much for a reinstall?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:49:34] ha not even going down tinfoil (yet)
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:51:03] izem: probably is end state for next beginning but thats why am asking trying to get an idea for the plan
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:52:11] my model right now is my workstation is the badness box since it has direct internet access and my "server" is the protected box
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[05:53:06] get into the badness box
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:53:09] so where do you go after that to make sure they are both as protected as possible from each other while still allowing...
2021-07-20 11:29:01	 *	Kyv [05:53:18] wags finger at chives 
2021-07-20 11:29:01	jessicara	[05:53:44] kinda hard to get any important files off things like that
2021-07-20 11:29:01	jessicara	[05:54:11] i remember using discs because the disc itself had no firmware to do such
2021-07-20 11:29:01	john_rambo	[05:54:35] I just installed Librewolf for the first time ..... I cant save passwords & if I close the browser all my active logins are gone & I have login all over again ....I need to stay logged in to a lot of sites ....(a) Whats the resoan behind this policy & (b) if you are using librewolf how do you manage ?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[05:55:18] what did you expect?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:55:20] that is the problem no matter the tech ill end up ill prob end up being the infector
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[05:56:48] john_rambo: go into preferences and change your history settings
2021-07-20 11:29:01	Kyv	[05:57:58] or dont use a browser geared toward privacy, as its going to clear everything when it closes.
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:58:24] first thing is.. so if im just direct transfering via smb... am wondering if samba might be a better option somehow? in terms of placing in a kerberous domain?
2021-07-20 11:29:01	chives	[05:58:35] kerberos

2021-07-20 11:34:11	Kyv	john_rambo: a standalone password manager such as pass or keepassxc can be make quick of it.

2021-07-20 11:36:07	john_rambo	Kyv: skeels I am already using KeePassXC but the problem is launching KeePassXC everytime I launch librewolf & copy/pasting so many usernames & passwords
2021-07-20 11:36:44	Izem	chives can't you just use ethernet?

2021-07-20 11:37:06	skeels	bitwarden has a browser extension with great autofill. it is cloud based but i think you can self-host if you want.

2021-07-20 11:37:40	NexAdn	john_rambo: if you can automate entering the passwords using shell scripting or similar, you can try pass. it's a native CLI password manager. in combination with rofi-pass it's also very comfortable to use outside the terminal
2021-07-20 11:37:49	Kyv	do not use a cloud based password manager
