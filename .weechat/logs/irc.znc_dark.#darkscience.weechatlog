2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:29:11] I'll go with a Thinkpad Mobile Workstation P14s AMD G1
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:29:25] 900 EUR, so middle-class, yet still pretty powerful
2021-07-17 19:43:51	+Bollox	[10:29:44] With linux and she doesn't have super user rights on it? ;)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:30:07] unfortunately, Windows, since she's a lawyer, dealing with a fuckton of MS Office documents
2021-07-17 19:43:51	+Bollox	[10:30:14] Ah, yeah, ok
2021-07-17 19:43:51	%chik	[10:30:20] jvoisin: nice sir, mostly for work or work/life?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:30:50] mostly work
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:31:15] I could have settled for something cheaper/shittier, but we don't like buying/changing electronic stuff
2021-07-17 19:43:51	%chik	[10:32:26] any sort of compensation bc it's for work?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:34:55] nope
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:34:59] she's part-time
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:35:06] and already has a computer (a desktop)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:35:33] but since she's making more money than me (hourly), she can afford to get herself a laptop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	%chik	[10:35:53] ahh very nice then

2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:38:04] because they wanted to "design videogames", not "learn maths"
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:38:13] damn I hated my classmates in the technical school
2021-07-17 19:43:51	%chik	[10:39:31] obviyus: you going to play
2021-07-17 19:43:51	+Bollox	[10:39:55] I haven't even played the original diablo 2, lol
2021-07-17 19:43:51	+obviyus	[10:39:56] i might if it has decent multiplayer 
2021-07-17 19:43:51	+Bollox	[10:40:04] Only the first. That was enough for me
2021-07-17 19:43:51	+obviyus	[10:40:12] Bollox: same, i like Grim Dawn and that is apparently a spiritual successor to i

2021-07-17 19:43:51	+Bollox	[10:40:55] chik: Yes, and no. I've played a few other rpgs a bit like it since, but I guess generally, that's not really my thing
2021-07-17 19:43:51	%chik	[10:41:06] fair fair
2021-07-17 19:43:51	+Bollox	[10:41:57] I guess I'm more of an immersive fps rpg player, like Deus Ex and such (fuck skyrim, because fuck bethesda xD)

2021-07-17 19:43:51	Oblivion	[10:51:22] Like Linux class
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Oblivion	[10:51:54] On the other hand I was allowed to spend time on pwning during those classes
2021-07-17 19:43:51	@jvoisin	[10:52:04] fortunately, it was linux-only <3
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Oblivion	[10:52:27] Heheh for security class I basically was the teacher
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Oblivion	[10:52:45] I was in front of the class teaching people stuff instead of the teacher most of the time

2021-07-17 23:35:18	%chik	[17:37:06] Basting is a cooking technique that involves cooking meat with either its own juices or some type of preparation such as a sauce or marinade. The meat is left to cook, then periodically coated with the juice.

2021-07-17 23:37:26	%chik	[17:37:06] Basting is a cooking technique that involves cooking meat with either its own juices or some type of preparation such as a sauce or marinade. The meat is left to cook, then periodically coated with the juice.
2021-07-17 23:37:26	+Bollox	[17:37:32] I guess I'm slowly cooking in my own sweat -____-

2021-07-17 23:53:30	%chik	[17:37:06] Basting is a cooking technique that involves cooking meat with either its own juices or some type of preparation such as a sauce or marinade. The meat is left to cook, then periodically coated with the juice.

2021-07-17 23:54:17	@jvoisin	[10:35:33] but since she's making more money than me (hourly), she can afford to get herself a laptop

2021-07-17 23:54:17	%chik	[17:37:06] Basting is a cooking technique that involves cooking meat with either its own juices or some type of preparation such as a sauce or marinade. The meat is left to cook, then periodically coated with the juice.

2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:56:44] indeed JoseAlPaca 
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:57:05] was in DE throughout most of the day
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:57:15] but yeah crossed the border and got a hotel here
2021-07-18 04:51:00	+JoseAlPaca	[20:57:16] :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:57:24] tomorrow we'll do the second half of the drive
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[20:57:29] that hotel life
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:57:41] obviously nobody looked into our vaccination/test certificates
2021-07-18 04:51:00	 *	JoseAlPaca [20:57:51] chuckles
2021-07-18 04:51:00	+JoseAlPaca	[20:58:00] nobody gives a damn really
2021-07-18 04:51:00	+JoseAlPaca	[20:58:07] just that you wear masks
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:58:17] my mum even went to get a test despite her having both shots because the administration on that was fucked and we couldn't get a QR code generated with both shots being marked as administered
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:58:25] and I only had 1 shot so I knew I should test
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:58:40] but yeah, nobody checked obviously ;p
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:58:49] at least we know we did the right thing :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[20:58:55] they may check further in
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:59:09] we'll do a selftest tomorrow afternoon before arriving at family too, just for our sake
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[20:59:39] chik: not really. it's supposed to be max 48h old at border crossing (negative test anyway), we're an hour past the border now, there's no real way to do that check anymore
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:00:13] all they could do is check my dad's full vaccination status really, but.. don't see who would
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:00:36] any sort of border patrol that may have been around, wasn't there. they won't be further in the country either.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:00:45] oh
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:00:53] perhaps just quarantine ppls
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:01:09] you have to quarantine if you don't have a full vaccination, negative test, or recovery proof
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:01:17] so we don't have to
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:01:42] but yeah nobody checked us either xD
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:01:59] not surprised at all though, this was the most likely scenario/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:02:03] but it is a bit of a joke.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:02:16] all these arbitary entry requirements that just don't get checked at all
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:02:35]  guess a flight would've been stricter
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:02:56] but even then, I could go on a flight without anything, as I could choose the option to get tested here within 48h of arrival, or quarantining
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:03:07] so all those passengers in the plane would be exposed and it'd be according to the rules
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:03:41] anyway, not a surprise nor is it important, something just to laugh at a bit ;p
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:03:46] how are you folks?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:04:07] they changed it here recently, if you comeback from an amber listed country and youre fully vaxxed you dont have to quarantine
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:04:26] they changed it again today, if you come back from france even if fully vaxxed you have to quarantine for 10 days
2021-07-18 04:51:00	sipa	[21:05:14] fun stuff, fluid 'legislation'
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:06:12] eh
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:06:22] shall wait before i can visit
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:08:15] chik: yeah and france itself also made their requirements stricter for other high risk areas, including NL and ES
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:08:36] oh no no
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:08:40] a negative test result is now valid 24h instead of 72h if you come from a "red" country according to the EU map
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:08:40] it's coming from france
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:08:41] not going to
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:08:49] I know, I'm talking about going to france.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:08:52] ah
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:09:14] so bit ironic, uk is scared of the french, the french are scared of the brits and others ;p
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:09:33] im afraid bc the uk is opening back up that un/who will decide to punish them in a way
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:09:42] weird that the UK is saying even fully vaccinated people need to quarantine though?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:09:47] strictest I've heard so far
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:09:52] only coming from france atm
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:09:57] or red listed
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:10:22] so do you get any benefit from being vaccinated or having a negative testresult from those areas then, coming into the UK?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:10:36] sounds like not anymore?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:10:49] bit strict, especially since the danger is more the other way around
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:11:26] you didnt have the option to not quarantine regardless of vax or not
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:11:40] if you returned from outside from a amber/red list you must quarantine
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:11:40] not before either?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:11:43] so what changed?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:12:03] a "french" variant
2021-07-18 04:51:00	 *	chik [21:12:07] shrugs
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:12:13] not what I meant
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:12:38] your last 2 sentences, imply nothing changed between today and before
2021-07-18 04:51:00	&Derecho	[21:12:43] but you were sayign it got stricter. how?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	%chik	[21:14:31] if you come back from france

2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:56:44] indeed JoseAlPaca 
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:57:05] was in DE throughout most of the day
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:57:15] but yeah crossed the border and got a hotel here
2021-07-18 05:12:19	+JoseAlPaca	[20:57:16] :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:57:24] tomorrow we'll do the second half of the drive
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[20:57:29] that hotel life
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:57:41] obviously nobody looked into our vaccination/test certificates
2021-07-18 05:12:19	 *	JoseAlPaca [20:57:51] chuckles
2021-07-18 05:12:19	+JoseAlPaca	[20:58:00] nobody gives a damn really
2021-07-18 05:12:19	+JoseAlPaca	[20:58:07] just that you wear masks
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:58:17] my mum even went to get a test despite her having both shots because the administration on that was fucked and we couldn't get a QR code generated with both shots being marked as administered
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:58:25] and I only had 1 shot so I knew I should test
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:58:40] but yeah, nobody checked obviously ;p
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:58:49] at least we know we did the right thing :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[20:58:55] they may check further in
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:59:09] we'll do a selftest tomorrow afternoon before arriving at family too, just for our sake
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[20:59:39] chik: not really. it's supposed to be max 48h old at border crossing (negative test anyway), we're an hour past the border now, there's no real way to do that check anymore
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:00:13] all they could do is check my dad's full vaccination status really, but.. don't see who would
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:00:36] any sort of border patrol that may have been around, wasn't there. they won't be further in the country either.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:00:45] oh
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:00:53] perhaps just quarantine ppls
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:01:09] you have to quarantine if you don't have a full vaccination, negative test, or recovery proof
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:01:17] so we don't have to
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:01:42] but yeah nobody checked us either xD
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:01:59] not surprised at all though, this was the most likely scenario/
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:02:03] but it is a bit of a joke.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:02:16] all these arbitary entry requirements that just don't get checked at all
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:02:35]  guess a flight would've been stricter
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:02:56] but even then, I could go on a flight without anything, as I could choose the option to get tested here within 48h of arrival, or quarantining
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:03:07] so all those passengers in the plane would be exposed and it'd be according to the rules
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:03:41] anyway, not a surprise nor is it important, something just to laugh at a bit ;p
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:03:46] how are you folks?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:04:07] they changed it here recently, if you comeback from an amber listed country and youre fully vaxxed you dont have to quarantine
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:04:26] they changed it again today, if you come back from france even if fully vaxxed you have to quarantine for 10 days
2021-07-18 05:12:19	sipa	[21:05:14] fun stuff, fluid 'legislation'
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:06:12] eh
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:06:22] shall wait before i can visit
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:08:15] chik: yeah and france itself also made their requirements stricter for other high risk areas, including NL and ES
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:08:36] oh no no
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:08:40] a negative test result is now valid 24h instead of 72h if you come from a "red" country according to the EU map
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:08:40] it's coming from france
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:08:41] not going to
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:08:49] I know, I'm talking about going to france.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:08:52] ah
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:09:14] so bit ironic, uk is scared of the french, the french are scared of the brits and others ;p
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:09:33] im afraid bc the uk is opening back up that un/who will decide to punish them in a way
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:09:42] weird that the UK is saying even fully vaccinated people need to quarantine though?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:09:47] strictest I've heard so far
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:09:52] only coming from france atm
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:09:57] or red listed
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:10:22] so do you get any benefit from being vaccinated or having a negative testresult from those areas then, coming into the UK?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:10:36] sounds like not anymore?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:10:49] bit strict, especially since the danger is more the other way around
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:11:26] you didnt have the option to not quarantine regardless of vax or not
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:11:40] if you returned from outside from a amber/red list you must quarantine
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:11:40] not before either?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:11:43] so what changed?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:12:03] a "french" variant
2021-07-18 05:12:19	 *	chik [21:12:07] shrugs
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:12:13] not what I meant
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:12:38] your last 2 sentences, imply nothing changed between today and before
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:12:43] but you were sayign it got stricter. how?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	%chik	[21:14:31] if you come back from france

2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:18:27] chik: ok I understand what it changed to I think, but not what it changed from?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	&Derecho	[21:19:10] you didn't have to quarantine before if you were vaxed? like how travel is now for most other EU coutries?

2021-07-18 16:36:23	kilroy	[02:17:40] if the metro ride is more than 45 minutes I can sleep standing up if I have two walls to lean against. 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:17:58] 45mins in the metro?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:18:08] you going to the other end of the island?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	kilroy	[02:18:22] taipei metro red line is long. 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:18:42] so is the u2, our red line
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:18:46] but 45 minutes ... phew
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:18:54] that must be 50km easy
2021-07-18 16:36:23	kilroy	[02:19:10] not sure our metro goes as fast. 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	%Digerati	[02:19:34] lol obviyus kinda funny the heaviest weights are the bright pink ones
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:19:44] 45 minutes here on the train gets you maybe 7-8 miles.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	%Digerati	[02:19:55] kind of effeminate using those isn't it? :P
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:20:08] What?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	sipa	[02:20:23] also can't even spell it's beijing :P
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:20:49] Digerati: you done your work out today?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	%Digerati	[02:21:01] nah narada today was a rest day
2021-07-18 16:36:23	kilroy	[02:21:08] Digerati: it's to compensate for how manly you are when you can lift them. the universe demands balance. 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	%Digerati	[02:21:17] haha kilroy 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:21:17] i will allow it Digerati

2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:22:06] i'm trying to pump myself up for leg day after work

2021-07-18 16:36:23	+obviyus	[02:23:30] Digerati: never noticed, probably because i’m a long way off from using those :>
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:23:37] Pink is not considered feminine in all cultures.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:23:41] sunday is my only offical rest day but sometimes i'm lazy and skip leg day on saturday :s
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:23:41] It is a learned thing.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:24:38] pink used to be a masculine color in the US too, in the early 1900s and before
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:24:42] and blue was feminine
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:24:46] i believe i read this somewhere
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nesoi	[02:24:54] I see those as orange
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nesoi	[02:24:56] not pink
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:25:22] Yeah, which weights are we talking about?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:25:31] The 25kg in the bottom right of the photo are orange.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:25:51] I see some reddish weights behind the yellow weights on the other side.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:25:53] yeah those are orange
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:26:01] stupid question
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:26:05] how is pink not manly?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:26:13] vegeta wore a pink shirt
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:26:16] i think that makes it manly
2021-07-18 16:36:23	 *	JoseAlPaca [02:26:22] shrugs
2021-07-18 16:36:23	%Digerati	[02:26:31] i have night shift on my screen so that might be impacting the color that it seems to be to me
2021-07-18 16:36:23	%Digerati	[02:26:37] narada: get pumped for leg day
2021-07-18 16:36:23	%Digerati	[02:26:39] GO GO GO
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nesoi	[02:26:39] JoseAlPaca:  research (questionable) shows that baby girls prefer pink and boys blue
2021-07-18 16:36:23	 *	narada [02:26:46] screams
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+SillyGoose	[02:26:59] when are you guys starting that?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:27:11] starting what?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:27:15] nesoi: you are aware that until the early 20th century those color associations were reversed, right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+SillyGoose	[02:27:19] I think squats
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nesoi	[02:27:29] I just do 25 squat jumps and call it done
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:27:29] red was associated with boys, blue with girls
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:27:34] an hour or so for me SillyGoose 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nesoi	[02:27:48] JoseAlPaca:  and that's why we have so much homosexuality now
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:27:52] lol
2021-07-18 16:36:23	 *	JoseAlPaca [02:27:56] snorts
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+SillyGoose	[02:27:56] an hour? you have a specific time?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:27:58] right
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:28:09] gives me 30 mins to get home after work SillyGoose 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:28:10] SillyGoose: just start preferring another color and you're cured
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:28:12] \o/
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:28:18] diggles as well!
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:28:41] gotta do squats, calf raises, lateral arm raises, front arm raises, overhead press, deadlift
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:28:53] i really should add a hamstring exercise but i'm so dead after deadlift
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:28:56] and squats
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nesoi	[02:29:44] ugh amI being lame by not doing all these other exercises?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:29:55] any exercise is good nesoi 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:30:16] but you also need to work other muscles so you don't create imbalance in your muscles which can lead to pain and injury
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:30:28] i carried a 15kg electric scooter down and up 3 stories
2021-07-18 16:36:23	kilroy	[02:30:30] I walk, run, hike and do some light weights at home nesoi 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+JoseAlPaca	[02:30:39] i'm obviously trained enough
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:30:40] so if you do push ups every day, you should also do something like rows to balance out your back
2021-07-18 16:36:23	kilroy	[02:30:49] it's ok if you don't lift. it just means you prefer the color pink more. 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+Requit	[02:31:01] Either you lift or you die
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:31:11] lol kilroy 
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:31:13] Requit: +1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	kilroy	[02:32:57] Requit: are you saying I can be immortal?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:36:27] Requit: You will die either way.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:36:45] narada: That is what pull ups are for.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+obviyus	[02:37:00] pull ups are hard yo
2021-07-18 16:36:23	@narada	[02:37:06] pull ups are great if you have somewhere to do them
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+obviyus	[02:37:14] i can maybe do 8 if i try super hard
2021-07-18 16:36:23	+obviyus	[02:37:17] after that i collapse
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:37:19] Just walk into the woods and live there.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:37:22] Use trees for pull ups.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:37:25] Fight animals.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	manicennui	[02:37:28] Hunt.

2021-07-18 16:36:24	@zeta	[09:48:43] convert 900 cm (centimeters) to inches = 354.3 inches
2021-07-18 16:36:24	@narada	[09:51:20] what are you calculating JoseAlPaca ?

2021-07-18 16:36:24	@narada	[09:51:45] i thought that at first
2021-07-18 16:36:24	@narada	[09:51:51] but 354 inches can't be right
2021-07-18 16:36:24	+Bollox	[09:51:54] penis girth, then?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	@narada	[09:51:54] too small

2021-07-18 16:36:24	@narada	[09:53:25] :/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	+JoseAlPaca	[09:53:42] it's a low pressure area
2021-07-18 16:36:24	+JoseAlPaca	[09:53:58] that sucks in wet air from the north sea and especially the mediterranean
2021-07-18 16:36:24	+JoseAlPaca	[09:54:25] throw in a lot of sun cause ... you know, summer ...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	@narada	[09:57:30] is it due to climate change or seems pretty normal for the area?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	+JoseAlPaca	[09:59:31] i would presume climate change
2021-07-18 16:36:24	+JoseAlPaca	[09:59:34] however
2021-07-18 16:36:24	+JoseAlPaca	[09:59:45] we've had a 10 year drought in germany/northern europe
2021-07-18 16:36:24	+JoseAlPaca	[10:00:13] and i just noticed the high water doesn't even enter the top 10 for my cousin's area

2021-07-18 20:21:09	kilroy	[02:18:22] taipei metro red line is long. 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:18:42] so is the u2, our red line
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:18:46] but 45 minutes ... phew
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:18:54] that must be 50km easy
2021-07-18 20:21:09	kilroy	[02:19:10] not sure our metro goes as fast. 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	%Digerati	[02:19:34] lol obviyus kinda funny the heaviest weights are the bright pink ones
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:19:44] 45 minutes here on the train gets you maybe 7-8 miles.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	%Digerati	[02:19:55] kind of effeminate using those isn't it? :P
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:20:08] What?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	sipa	[02:20:23] also can't even spell it's beijing :P
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:20:49] Digerati: you done your work out today?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	%Digerati	[02:21:01] nah narada today was a rest day
2021-07-18 20:21:09	kilroy	[02:21:08] Digerati: it's to compensate for how manly you are when you can lift them. the universe demands balance. 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	%Digerati	[02:21:17] haha kilroy 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:21:17] i will allow it Digerati

2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:22:06] i'm trying to pump myself up for leg day after work

2021-07-18 20:21:09	+obviyus	[02:23:30] Digerati: never noticed, probably because i’m a long way off from using those :>
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:23:37] Pink is not considered feminine in all cultures.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:23:41] sunday is my only offical rest day but sometimes i'm lazy and skip leg day on saturday :s
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:23:41] It is a learned thing.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:24:38] pink used to be a masculine color in the US too, in the early 1900s and before
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:24:42] and blue was feminine
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:24:46] i believe i read this somewhere
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nesoi	[02:24:54] I see those as orange
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nesoi	[02:24:56] not pink
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:25:22] Yeah, which weights are we talking about?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:25:31] The 25kg in the bottom right of the photo are orange.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:25:51] I see some reddish weights behind the yellow weights on the other side.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:25:53] yeah those are orange
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:26:01] stupid question
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:26:05] how is pink not manly?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:26:13] vegeta wore a pink shirt
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:26:16] i think that makes it manly
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	JoseAlPaca [02:26:22] shrugs
2021-07-18 20:21:09	%Digerati	[02:26:31] i have night shift on my screen so that might be impacting the color that it seems to be to me
2021-07-18 20:21:09	%Digerati	[02:26:37] narada: get pumped for leg day
2021-07-18 20:21:09	%Digerati	[02:26:39] GO GO GO
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nesoi	[02:26:39] JoseAlPaca:  research (questionable) shows that baby girls prefer pink and boys blue
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	narada [02:26:46] screams
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+SillyGoose	[02:26:59] when are you guys starting that?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:27:11] starting what?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:27:15] nesoi: you are aware that until the early 20th century those color associations were reversed, right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+SillyGoose	[02:27:19] I think squats
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nesoi	[02:27:29] I just do 25 squat jumps and call it done
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:27:29] red was associated with boys, blue with girls
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:27:34] an hour or so for me SillyGoose 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nesoi	[02:27:48] JoseAlPaca:  and that's why we have so much homosexuality now
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:27:52] lol
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	JoseAlPaca [02:27:56] snorts
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+SillyGoose	[02:27:56] an hour? you have a specific time?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:27:58] right
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:28:09] gives me 30 mins to get home after work SillyGoose 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:28:10] SillyGoose: just start preferring another color and you're cured
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:28:12] \o/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:28:18] diggles as well!
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:28:41] gotta do squats, calf raises, lateral arm raises, front arm raises, overhead press, deadlift
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:28:53] i really should add a hamstring exercise but i'm so dead after deadlift
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:28:56] and squats
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nesoi	[02:29:44] ugh amI being lame by not doing all these other exercises?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:29:55] any exercise is good nesoi 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:30:16] but you also need to work other muscles so you don't create imbalance in your muscles which can lead to pain and injury
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:30:28] i carried a 15kg electric scooter down and up 3 stories
2021-07-18 20:21:09	kilroy	[02:30:30] I walk, run, hike and do some light weights at home nesoi 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[02:30:39] i'm obviously trained enough
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:30:40] so if you do push ups every day, you should also do something like rows to balance out your back
2021-07-18 20:21:09	kilroy	[02:30:49] it's ok if you don't lift. it just means you prefer the color pink more. 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+Requit	[02:31:01] Either you lift or you die
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:31:11] lol kilroy 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:31:13] Requit: +1
2021-07-18 20:21:09	kilroy	[02:32:57] Requit: are you saying I can be immortal?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:36:27] Requit: You will die either way.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:36:45] narada: That is what pull ups are for.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+obviyus	[02:37:00] pull ups are hard yo
2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[02:37:06] pull ups are great if you have somewhere to do them
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+obviyus	[02:37:14] i can maybe do 8 if i try super hard
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+obviyus	[02:37:17] after that i collapse
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:37:19] Just walk into the woods and live there.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:37:22] Use trees for pull ups.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:37:25] Fight animals.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	manicennui	[02:37:28] Hunt.

2021-07-18 20:21:09	@narada	[09:57:30] is it due to climate change or seems pretty normal for the area?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[09:59:31] i would presume climate change
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[09:59:34] however
2021-07-18 20:21:09	+JoseAlPaca	[09:59:45] we've had a 10 year drought in germany/northern europe

2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[20:53:23] yeah I see. Maybe I should make a device that I can carry around that just tells me if it has signal and record how often I do/don't have it when walking around an area

2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:00:40] yeah I just ordered https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/3178/6098603 for use with the helum netowrk
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:01:03] coming on the 22nd
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:02:06] cool :D lmk when it's there!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:04:15] I will :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:11:50] Digerati: do you have any recommendations on antennas?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:11:58] I heard you did research
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:12:20] this is the one i use for mine and to include with the hotspots i ordered when i send them to friends/family: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/linx-technologies-inc/ANT-916-MHW-RPS-S/446320
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:12:48] does that connect directly to your hotspot?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:12:58] decent gain without being too narrow, and easy to stick on a window to get good line of sight without having to try to create a shelf or mount the hotspot otherwise
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:12:59] yeah
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:13:39] I see. I think my application would require something on the roof
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:13:58] possibly, and probably a higher gain antenna too, possibly a directional one
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:14:18] I'd prefer to not need a directional one but yeah maybe
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:14:43] well you have a specific use case, trying to reach a location that's quite a ways away from the hotspot
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:15:25] yeah, I also need the hotspot to act as a wifi router
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:15:43] which the rpi already does but still
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:16:01] you think it would be ok to put that antenna i linked on the outside of my window rather than the inside?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:16:17] apparently, double paned glass like what i have does attenuate the signal
2021-07-19 11:15:18	sipa	[21:16:41] yea, those have like thin metal coatings
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:16:47] depends on how long the wire is
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:17:03] I can route it through the attic
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:17:33] well you don't want a long cable between the hotspot and the antenna, that will decrease the gain through normal loss through the cable

2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:29:12] it's not rated for outdoor use so i assume that's a no-no
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:29:48] honestly. I doubt it would hurt it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[21:30:26] it may stop working temporarily while wet but otherwise it would be ok for water/cold I'd assume

2021-07-19 11:15:18	+JoseAlPaca	[21:31:01] is the window really dampening that much?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:31:16] i've heard it does
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[21:31:20] don't know for sure though

2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[01:46:54] hai
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[01:47:19] veganix: not sure if you noticed awfweg was banned from this channel. ;[
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[01:47:36] bryno: that was days ago and she got unbanned
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[01:47:51] it's back in place
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[01:47:59] since when?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[01:48:06] yesterday it seems
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[01:48:12] I see
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[01:48:54] what did she do?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@narada	[01:49:21] i wondered why it was so calm and peaceful here
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[01:50:25] i hadn't scrolled up far enough to see the cause of the 2nd ban. 1st was some kind of racist thing.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[01:50:35] narada: lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	brea-	[01:52:47] Lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[01:53:21] brea-: howdy. how's you?

2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[01:54:51] good here. kinda bored
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[02:03:48] nesoi: lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[02:06:25] how are you guys?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[02:16:29] bryno: its it a perma ban?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[02:26:52] it's permanent until someone removes it :P
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[02:29:02] wait fr?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[02:30:28] seems like it.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[02:34:09] in duolingo there's this weekly competitive thing and got 1st place in my little group this week. hooray
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[02:47:02] SillyGoose:  what's the lol?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	%Digerati	[02:51:21] i think he meant narada 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[02:59:53] nesoi: oh yeah I meant narada
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+SillyGoose	[03:00:12] Sorry about that 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:00:18] oic
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:00:27] bryno:  what lang?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:01:46] japanese
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:05:11] bryno:  I started doing that too
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:05:23] can't remember the damned symbols that well tho
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:05:39] and I swear they try to trip you up so you'll lose lives and subscribe to the paid version
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:06:50] what level did you get to so far bryno?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:06:56] nesoi: are you doing it on the mobile app? they don't have that restriction on the website
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:07:22] website vs app is weird. some of the differences are a bit odd.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:07:42] i'm on hiragana 4 -- not very far. :D
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:08:02] i max out on all of the levels before going to the next section
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:08:09] doing it on mobile
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:08:41] ah I already go to katakana 2
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:08:58] not that I know it or anything
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:09:52] haven't even gotten to katakana in the little character section part.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:10:10] they suddenly throw in kanji without mentioning it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:10:11] i'm trying to remember the characters, so doing all of the practices. lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:10:53] do you write notes while going through lessons?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:10:57] hm. so I should try the site
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:11:50] they don't have the heart thing on the website.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:12:09] odd
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:12:20] i was confused what the hearts were. their reasoning is that you're making too many mistakes, so maybe you need a break. lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:13:20] then again, they don't have the character practice section on the website either
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:18:34] the desktop version doesn't have hearts 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:18:38] i mostly stick to that
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:20:09] good to know
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:27:31] obviyus:  what language(s) are you working on?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:27:39] nesoi: French
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:27:47] but i've only been studying a week so far 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:27:55] quelle domage
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:28:11] Pourquoi?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:28:35] "too bad"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:28:40] :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:28:54] i think it means "what a shame" :>
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:28:54] I speak many languages very slightly
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:29:04] those are similar meanings
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:29:08] ah fair
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:29:34] but oui, i'm working on my pronunciations + vocabulary for now
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:29:45] pronunciation is tricky
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:29:48] are you a good mimick?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:30:03] i'm okay-ish, the r is giving me some trouble 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:30:15] how's your english? is it indian english, english engish, USA english, or australian etc ?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:30:41] i'm fairly certain it's British English 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:30:47] I once traded French lessons with a private teacher for accent lessons
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:30:55] I was teaching her how to get rid of her french accent
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:31:11] I think the French accent's cute 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:31:11] same thing happened that usually happens:
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:31:29] I got her to speak with an American accent and she hated the way it felt
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:31:34] hahahah
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:31:38] didn't want her mouth to do that stuff
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[03:31:43] obviyus: Pourquoi apprend-tu le français?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:32:11] veganix: i'm not very good yet but i'd guess you're asking the motivation behind me learning French 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[03:32:22] obviyus: that's correct
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:32:26] :D
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:32:41] bunch of reasons but mostly immigration 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[03:32:55] to?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:33:00] Canada'
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[03:33:27] Good luck
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:33:33] merci 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	veganix	[03:33:38] Where are you from?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:33:53] veganix: India 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:34:06] obviyus:  have family in canada?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:34:25] i do, but the vast vast majority of my family lives in the US
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:34:36] but you concluded that the US sucks so...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:34:51] nesoi: no i'm not a part of the Reddit hate boner :>
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:34:58] but it does suck
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@narada	[03:34:59] canada does seem to be a better choice
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@narada	[03:35:06] if you get to choose
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:35:07] but i can't realistically move to the US long term
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:35:40] canada seems nicer
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:35:52] USA is too full of aggressive idiots
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:35:54] narada: coming from a third world country i'd say ANY western country that'll have me is better :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:36:11] obviyus:  why is your english so… grammatical? 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:36:26] nesoi: lol i don't really know how to answer that?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:36:44] studying since you were young or?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:37:00] English? probably the first language i ever learned
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:37:17] ah ok, why's that?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	obviyus [03:37:21] shrugs 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:37:47] sorry don't mean to be nosey
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:37:56] nah you're not 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:38:05] but it's what most people around me use most often 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:38:13] that's a factor i'd guess 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:38:21] what's the 2nd language?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:38:28] Hindi, of course 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:38:44] I dunno… there are lots of languages in india
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:39:04] yeah, like 1,800 or so
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:39:12] yeah
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:39:12] my coworker (from india) says pretty much every state has its own language
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:39:36] yeah think we have like 22 official languages 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:39:45] a lot
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[03:40:04] is hindi grammar similar to english or french?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:40:09] but nearly everyone falls into the overlap of English + Hindi 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:40:16] nesoi: French for sure 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:40:28] pronunciations are consistent, nouns have genders 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:40:55] how many genders? >_>
2021-07-19 11:15:18	@bryno	[03:40:58] jk
2021-07-19 11:15:18	+obviyus	[03:41:27] well officially the country recognizes two :>

2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[04:21:56] the girl made gnocchi, but it was an experiment and they came out more like mochi
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[04:22:17] so it was a new invention: cauliflower mochi!

2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:16:33] which carrier?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:16:52] Unsure, AZ or Moderna
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:17:22] moderna is many times stronger, but also much less standard
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:17:44] AZ is made with a form of the spike that is not as good according to many/most
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:18:11] yah, but I'm worried about the heart inflammation with moderna, as I have a heart issue. 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:18:29] ah. az doesn't have that too?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:19:39] nah, just the clotting I think. 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:20:03] not entirely sure
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:20:11] either way, I'll get something. 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:20:21] ah
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:20:23] don't want to head back to school without it. 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:20:26] it was after the 2nd dose

2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:20:31] for moderna
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:20:39] so: get 1 dose of AZ and one of moderna
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:20:53] that's been tried and works well with AZ and Pfizer
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:20:56] should be the same
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:20:58] they haven't approved that here, yet, but I think they will. 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:21:09] Pzifer arrives I think in September. 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:21:35] hmm chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart after vaccination
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:21:40] I have that all the time!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:21:50] not really
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:21:51] maybe it'll fix it?

2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:25:55] might pick one up, but usually I can tell when it's acting up. 
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:26:04] records to an app and you can send the trace to a dr
2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:26:14] also they have online docs who will analyze for a small fee :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kilroy	[05:27:25] I just book a doc here and walk to the hospital. I live 10 minutes from the best hopsital for cardiac stuff and can usually get in to see a doc in 1-3 days.

2021-07-19 11:15:18	nesoi	[05:28:08] otherwise they do an EKG for 10 sec and if nothing is going on there, they see nothing

2021-07-19 11:21:27	@narada	30-50k$ is a huge amount, and if the market falls again that means you've overpaid 30-50k for a house you will never get that much money for when you try to sell it years later

2021-07-19 12:03:31	+SillyGoose	[02:16:29] bryno: its it a perma ban?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	%Digerati	[02:26:52] it's permanent until someone removes it :P
2021-07-19 12:03:31	veganix	[02:29:02] wait fr?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[02:30:28] seems like it.
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[02:34:09] in duolingo there's this weekly competitive thing and got 1st place in my little group this week. hooray
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[02:47:02] SillyGoose:  what's the lol?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	%Digerati	[02:51:21] i think he meant narada 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+SillyGoose	[02:59:53] nesoi: oh yeah I meant narada
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+SillyGoose	[03:00:12] Sorry about that 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:00:18] oic
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:00:27] bryno:  what lang?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:01:46] japanese
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:05:11] bryno:  I started doing that too
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:05:23] can't remember the damned symbols that well tho
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:05:39] and I swear they try to trip you up so you'll lose lives and subscribe to the paid version
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:06:50] what level did you get to so far bryno?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:06:56] nesoi: are you doing it on the mobile app? they don't have that restriction on the website
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:07:22] website vs app is weird. some of the differences are a bit odd.
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:07:42] i'm on hiragana 4 -- not very far. :D
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:08:02] i max out on all of the levels before going to the next section
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:08:09] doing it on mobile
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:08:41] ah I already go to katakana 2
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:08:58] not that I know it or anything
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:09:52] haven't even gotten to katakana in the little character section part.
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:10:10] they suddenly throw in kanji without mentioning it
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:10:11] i'm trying to remember the characters, so doing all of the practices. lol
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:10:53] do you write notes while going through lessons?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:10:57] hm. so I should try the site
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:11:50] they don't have the heart thing on the website.
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:12:09] odd
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:12:20] i was confused what the hearts were. their reasoning is that you're making too many mistakes, so maybe you need a break. lol
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:13:20] then again, they don't have the character practice section on the website either
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:18:34] the desktop version doesn't have hearts 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:18:38] i mostly stick to that
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:20:09] good to know
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:27:31] obviyus:  what language(s) are you working on?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:27:39] nesoi: French
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:27:47] but i've only been studying a week so far 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:27:55] quelle domage
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:28:11] Pourquoi?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:28:35] "too bad"
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:28:40] :)
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:28:54] i think it means "what a shame" :>
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:28:54] I speak many languages very slightly
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:29:04] those are similar meanings
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:29:08] ah fair
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:29:34] but oui, i'm working on my pronunciations + vocabulary for now
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:29:45] pronunciation is tricky
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:29:48] are you a good mimick?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:30:03] i'm okay-ish, the r is giving me some trouble 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:30:15] how's your english? is it indian english, english engish, USA english, or australian etc ?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:30:41] i'm fairly certain it's British English 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:30:47] I once traded French lessons with a private teacher for accent lessons
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:30:55] I was teaching her how to get rid of her french accent
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:31:11] I think the French accent's cute 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:31:11] same thing happened that usually happens:
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:31:29] I got her to speak with an American accent and she hated the way it felt
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:31:34] hahahah
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:31:38] didn't want her mouth to do that stuff
2021-07-19 12:03:31	veganix	[03:31:43] obviyus: Pourquoi apprend-tu le français?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:32:11] veganix: i'm not very good yet but i'd guess you're asking the motivation behind me learning French 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	veganix	[03:32:22] obviyus: that's correct
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:32:26] :D
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:32:41] bunch of reasons but mostly immigration 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	veganix	[03:32:55] to?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:33:00] Canada'
2021-07-19 12:03:31	veganix	[03:33:27] Good luck
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:33:33] merci 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	veganix	[03:33:38] Where are you from?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:33:53] veganix: India 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:34:06] obviyus:  have family in canada?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:34:25] i do, but the vast vast majority of my family lives in the US
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:34:36] but you concluded that the US sucks so...
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:34:51] nesoi: no i'm not a part of the Reddit hate boner :>
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:34:58] but it does suck
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@narada	[03:34:59] canada does seem to be a better choice
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@narada	[03:35:06] if you get to choose
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:35:07] but i can't realistically move to the US long term
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:35:40] canada seems nicer
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:35:52] USA is too full of aggressive idiots
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:35:54] narada: coming from a third world country i'd say ANY western country that'll have me is better :)
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:36:11] obviyus:  why is your english so… grammatical? 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:36:26] nesoi: lol i don't really know how to answer that?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:36:44] studying since you were young or?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:37:00] English? probably the first language i ever learned
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:37:17] ah ok, why's that?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	 *	obviyus [03:37:21] shrugs 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:37:47] sorry don't mean to be nosey
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:37:56] nah you're not 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:38:05] but it's what most people around me use most often 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:38:13] that's a factor i'd guess 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:38:21] what's the 2nd language?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:38:28] Hindi, of course 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:38:44] I dunno… there are lots of languages in india
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:39:04] yeah, like 1,800 or so
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:39:12] yeah
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:39:12] my coworker (from india) says pretty much every state has its own language
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:39:36] yeah think we have like 22 official languages 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:39:45] a lot
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[03:40:04] is hindi grammar similar to english or french?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:40:09] but nearly everyone falls into the overlap of English + Hindi 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:40:16] nesoi: French for sure 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:40:28] pronunciations are consistent, nouns have genders 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:40:55] how many genders? >_>
2021-07-19 12:03:31	@bryno	[03:40:58] jk
2021-07-19 12:03:31	+obviyus	[03:41:27] well officially the country recognizes two :>

2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[05:15:50] you mean vaccine?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[05:16:33] which carrier?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	kilroy	[05:16:52] Unsure, AZ or Moderna
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[05:17:22] moderna is many times stronger, but also much less standard
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[05:17:44] AZ is made with a form of the spike that is not as good according to many/most
2021-07-19 12:03:31	kilroy	[05:18:11] yah, but I'm worried about the heart inflammation with moderna, as I have a heart issue. 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	nesoi	[05:18:29] ah. az doesn't have that too?
2021-07-19 12:03:31	kilroy	[05:19:39] nah, just the clotting I think. 
2021-07-19 12:03:31	kilroy	[05:20:03] not entirely sure
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:20:11] either way, I'll get something. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:20:21] ah
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:20:23] don't want to head back to school without it. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:20:26] it was after the 2nd dose
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:20:31] kids are germ factories. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:20:31] for moderna
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:20:39] so: get 1 dose of AZ and one of moderna
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:20:53] that's been tried and works well with AZ and Pfizer
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:20:56] should be the same
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:20:58] they haven't approved that here, yet, but I think they will. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:21:09] Pzifer arrives I think in September. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:21:35] hmm chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart after vaccination
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:21:40] I have that all the time!
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:21:50] not really
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:21:51] maybe it'll fix it?

2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:25:55] might pick one up, but usually I can tell when it's acting up. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:26:04] records to an app and you can send the trace to a dr
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:26:14] also they have online docs who will analyze for a small fee :)
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:27:25] I just book a doc here and walk to the hospital. I live 10 minutes from the best hopsital for cardiac stuff and can usually get in to see a doc in 1-3 days. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:27:53] sure but this way you can record it when it's happening
2021-07-19 12:03:32	nesoi	[05:28:08] otherwise they do an EKG for 10 sec and if nothing is going on there, they see nothing
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:28:16] my ekg last night was off quite a bit.

2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:28:37] I'll ask the doc about it. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:28:51] Probably can get it on the health plan here.

2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:37:53] more that move there, the more likely it is to change, I would think.

2021-07-19 12:03:32	@narada	[05:49:07] i'm hoping the market comes back down later this year
2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:49:10] hopefully the market cools off
2021-07-19 12:03:32	@narada	[05:49:16] if it keeps going up eternally i will never afford a house :(

2021-07-19 12:03:32	kilroy	[05:49:47] I save a decent amount of cash every year, but still look at housing prices and what I'd get for it, and balk. 
2021-07-19 12:03:32	sun-light	[05:50:09] I thought with the covid etc will be more affordable
2021-07-19 12:03:32	@narada	[05:50:15] yes sun-light it's brutal right now. houses are like 30-50k overpriced from last year

2021-07-19 12:03:32	sun-light	[05:51:03] That's a lot
2021-07-19 12:03:32	@narada	[05:51:27] 30-50k$ is a huge amount, and if the market falls again that means you've overpaid 30-50k for a house you will never get that much money for when you try to sell it years later
2021-07-19 12:03:32	@narada	[05:51:59] interest rates are very low however
2021-07-19 12:03:32	@narada	[05:52:04] so that's a perk for some people

2021-07-19 12:03:32	+JoseAlPaca	[06:32:06] i wonder why muricans have such a fetish naming their kids after themselves
2021-07-19 12:03:32	+JoseAlPaca	[06:32:30] you see quite a lot people like that in public life
2021-07-19 12:03:32	%chik	[06:32:41] my mother did that
2021-07-19 12:03:32	%chik	[06:32:48] but she's definitely not american
2021-07-19 12:03:32	@narada	[06:33:03] i'd probably name my kid fbs
2021-07-19 12:03:32	%chik	[06:33:12] fubs
2021-07-19 12:03:32	+JoseAlPaca	[06:33:26] i'm quite an exception being named after my father, grandfather, great-grandfather, ... going back 200 years all had the same first or middle name for their first born males

2021-07-19 12:11:42	%Digerati	[21:38:00] sounds about right
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+JoseAlPaca	[21:38:11] so yeah, it's uhf
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+JoseAlPaca	[21:38:32] i'd still do actual testing to see if it's worth the effort
2021-07-19 12:11:42	%Digerati	[21:38:52] for reference, if i put the hotspot itself outside on the ledge of my window, it can't connect to my 5 GHz router about 3m away, through the window
2021-07-19 12:11:42	%Digerati	[21:39:03] 2.4 GHz does work though
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:10] yeah
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:12] invalid test
2021-07-19 12:11:42	%Digerati	[21:39:19] i know, i'm just telling you the data i have lol
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:20] 5ghz is notorious for getting absorbed
2021-07-19 12:11:42	%Digerati	[21:39:34] yup, you get faster speed in exchange for smaller range :P
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:43] not necessarily
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:52] the new standards all work in both ranges
2021-07-19 12:11:42	%Digerati	[21:39:54] well, more easily obstructed signal

2021-07-19 12:11:42	%Digerati	[02:26:52] it's permanent until someone removes it :P
2021-07-19 12:11:42	veganix	[02:29:02] wait fr?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[02:30:28] seems like it.
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[02:34:09] in duolingo there's this weekly competitive thing and got 1st place in my little group this week. hooray
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[02:47:02] SillyGoose:  what's the lol?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	%Digerati	[02:51:21] i think he meant narada 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+SillyGoose	[02:59:53] nesoi: oh yeah I meant narada
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+SillyGoose	[03:00:12] Sorry about that 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:00:18] oic
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:00:27] bryno:  what lang?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:01:46] japanese
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:05:11] bryno:  I started doing that too
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:05:23] can't remember the damned symbols that well tho
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:05:39] and I swear they try to trip you up so you'll lose lives and subscribe to the paid version
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:06:50] what level did you get to so far bryno?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:06:56] nesoi: are you doing it on the mobile app? they don't have that restriction on the website
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:07:22] website vs app is weird. some of the differences are a bit odd.
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:07:42] i'm on hiragana 4 -- not very far. :D
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:08:02] i max out on all of the levels before going to the next section
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:08:09] doing it on mobile
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:08:41] ah I already go to katakana 2
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:08:58] not that I know it or anything
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:09:52] haven't even gotten to katakana in the little character section part.
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:10:10] they suddenly throw in kanji without mentioning it
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:10:11] i'm trying to remember the characters, so doing all of the practices. lol
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:10:53] do you write notes while going through lessons?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:10:57] hm. so I should try the site
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:11:50] they don't have the heart thing on the website.
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:12:09] odd
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:12:20] i was confused what the hearts were. their reasoning is that you're making too many mistakes, so maybe you need a break. lol
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:13:20] then again, they don't have the character practice section on the website either
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:18:34] the desktop version doesn't have hearts 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:18:38] i mostly stick to that
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:20:09] good to know
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:27:31] obviyus:  what language(s) are you working on?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:27:39] nesoi: French
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:27:47] but i've only been studying a week so far 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:27:55] quelle domage
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:28:11] Pourquoi?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:28:35] "too bad"
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:28:40] :)
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:28:54] i think it means "what a shame" :>
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:28:54] I speak many languages very slightly
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:29:04] those are similar meanings
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:29:08] ah fair
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:29:34] but oui, i'm working on my pronunciations + vocabulary for now
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:29:45] pronunciation is tricky
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:29:48] are you a good mimick?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:30:03] i'm okay-ish, the r is giving me some trouble 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:30:15] how's your english? is it indian english, english engish, USA english, or australian etc ?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:30:41] i'm fairly certain it's British English 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:30:47] I once traded French lessons with a private teacher for accent lessons
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:30:55] I was teaching her how to get rid of her french accent
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:31:11] I think the French accent's cute 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:31:11] same thing happened that usually happens:
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:31:29] I got her to speak with an American accent and she hated the way it felt
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:31:34] hahahah
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:31:38] didn't want her mouth to do that stuff
2021-07-19 12:11:42	veganix	[03:31:43] obviyus: Pourquoi apprend-tu le français?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:32:11] veganix: i'm not very good yet but i'd guess you're asking the motivation behind me learning French 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	veganix	[03:32:22] obviyus: that's correct
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:32:26] :D
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:32:41] bunch of reasons but mostly immigration 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	veganix	[03:32:55] to?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:33:00] Canada'
2021-07-19 12:11:42	veganix	[03:33:27] Good luck
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:33:33] merci 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	veganix	[03:33:38] Where are you from?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:33:53] veganix: India 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:34:06] obviyus:  have family in canada?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:34:25] i do, but the vast vast majority of my family lives in the US
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:34:36] but you concluded that the US sucks so...
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:34:51] nesoi: no i'm not a part of the Reddit hate boner :>
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:34:58] but it does suck
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@narada	[03:34:59] canada does seem to be a better choice
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@narada	[03:35:06] if you get to choose
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:35:07] but i can't realistically move to the US long term
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:35:40] canada seems nicer
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:35:52] USA is too full of aggressive idiots
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:35:54] narada: coming from a third world country i'd say ANY western country that'll have me is better :)
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:36:11] obviyus:  why is your english so… grammatical? 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:36:26] nesoi: lol i don't really know how to answer that?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:36:44] studying since you were young or?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:37:00] English? probably the first language i ever learned
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:37:17] ah ok, why's that?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	 *	obviyus [03:37:21] shrugs 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:37:47] sorry don't mean to be nosey
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:37:56] nah you're not 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:38:05] but it's what most people around me use most often 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:38:13] that's a factor i'd guess 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:38:21] what's the 2nd language?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:38:28] Hindi, of course 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:38:44] I dunno… there are lots of languages in india
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:39:04] yeah, like 1,800 or so
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:39:12] yeah
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:39:12] my coworker (from india) says pretty much every state has its own language
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:39:36] yeah think we have like 22 official languages 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:39:45] a lot
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[03:40:04] is hindi grammar similar to english or french?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:40:09] but nearly everyone falls into the overlap of English + Hindi 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:40:16] nesoi: French for sure 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:40:28] pronunciations are consistent, nouns have genders 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:40:55] how many genders? >_>
2021-07-19 12:11:42	@bryno	[03:40:58] jk
2021-07-19 12:11:42	+obviyus	[03:41:27] well officially the country recognizes two :>

2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:15:46] 5g?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:15:50] you mean vaccine?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:16:33] which carrier?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:16:52] Unsure, AZ or Moderna
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:17:22] moderna is many times stronger, but also much less standard
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:17:44] AZ is made with a form of the spike that is not as good according to many/most
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:18:11] yah, but I'm worried about the heart inflammation with moderna, as I have a heart issue. 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:18:29] ah. az doesn't have that too?
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:19:39] nah, just the clotting I think. 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:20:03] not entirely sure
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:20:11] either way, I'll get something. 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:20:21] ah
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:20:23] don't want to head back to school without it. 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:20:26] it was after the 2nd dose
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:20:31] kids are germ factories. 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:20:31] for moderna
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:20:39] so: get 1 dose of AZ and one of moderna
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:20:53] that's been tried and works well with AZ and Pfizer
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:20:56] should be the same
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:20:58] they haven't approved that here, yet, but I think they will. 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:21:09] Pzifer arrives I think in September. 
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:21:35] hmm chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart after vaccination
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:21:40] I have that all the time!
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:21:50] not really
2021-07-19 12:11:42	kilroy	[05:21:51] maybe it'll fix it?

2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:22:32] incidence was about 1.3 per 100,000 doses
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:22:45] seems fairly low risk maybe
2021-07-19 12:11:42	nesoi	[05:22:56] do you have an EKG?

2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:25:55] might pick one up, but usually I can tell when it's acting up. 
2021-07-19 12:11:43	nesoi	[05:26:04] records to an app and you can send the trace to a dr
2021-07-19 12:11:43	nesoi	[05:26:14] also they have online docs who will analyze for a small fee :)
2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:27:25] I just book a doc here and walk to the hospital. I live 10 minutes from the best hopsital for cardiac stuff and can usually get in to see a doc in 1-3 days. 
2021-07-19 12:11:43	nesoi	[05:27:53] sure but this way you can record it when it's happening
2021-07-19 12:11:43	nesoi	[05:28:08] otherwise they do an EKG for 10 sec and if nothing is going on there, they see nothing
2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:28:16] my ekg last night was off quite a bit.

2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:28:37] I'll ask the doc about it. 
2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:28:51] Probably can get it on the health plan here. 
2021-07-19 12:11:43	nesoi	[05:28:53] there are also these monitors you can glue on your chest for 2 weeks
2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[05:29:41] any veterinarian-knowledgeable people here?
2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:29:42] mine is mostly likely caused by aggravating an existing condition with too much caffeine and lack of sleep.

2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:31:43] I've read a lot of tech companies have left. 
2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:32:03] or people are doing wfh from elsewhere. 
2021-07-19 12:11:43	nesoi	[05:32:24] I don't know about tech companies that left

2021-07-19 12:11:43	nesoi	[05:32:37] and he got a job working for the govt

2021-07-19 12:11:43	nesoi	[05:36:30] maybe

2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:37:53] more that move there, the more likely it is to change, I would think.

2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[05:49:07] i'm hoping the market comes back down later this year
2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:49:10] hopefully the market cools off
2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[05:49:16] if it keeps going up eternally i will never afford a house :(
2021-07-19 12:11:43	sun-light	[05:49:40] It's going up ?
2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:49:47] I save a decent amount of cash every year, but still look at housing prices and what I'd get for it, and balk. 
2021-07-19 12:11:43	sun-light	[05:50:09] I thought with the covid etc will be more affordable
2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[05:50:15] yes sun-light it's brutal right now. houses are like 30-50k overpriced from last year

2021-07-19 12:11:43	sun-light	[05:51:03] That's a lot
2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[05:51:27] 30-50k$ is a huge amount, and if the market falls again that means you've overpaid 30-50k for a house you will never get that much money for when you try to sell it years later
2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[05:51:59] interest rates are very low however
2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[05:52:04] so that's a perk for some people
2021-07-19 12:11:43	sun-light	[05:52:20] So expensive
2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[05:52:27] indeed

2021-07-19 12:11:43	kilroy	[05:58:42] We could pitch in and build a castle like the guy that made Bishop's Castle.

2021-07-19 12:11:43	+JoseAlPaca	[06:32:06] i wonder why muricans have such a fetish naming their kids after themselves
2021-07-19 12:11:43	+JoseAlPaca	[06:32:30] you see quite a lot people like that in public life
2021-07-19 12:11:43	%chik	[06:32:41] my mother did that
2021-07-19 12:11:43	%chik	[06:32:48] but she's definitely not american
2021-07-19 12:11:43	@narada	[06:33:03] i'd probably name my kid fbs
2021-07-19 12:11:43	%chik	[06:33:12] fubs
2021-07-19 12:11:43	+JoseAlPaca	[06:33:26] i'm quite an exception being named after my father, grandfather, great-grandfather, ... going back 200 years all had the same first or middle name for their first born males

2021-07-19 12:11:43	+Diannao	[06:37:31] but when they go back to scotland or ireland they allways can claim that they are ancestor of some king!

2021-07-19 13:14:04	%Digerati	[21:38:00] sounds about right
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+JoseAlPaca	[21:38:11] so yeah, it's uhf
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+JoseAlPaca	[21:38:32] i'd still do actual testing to see if it's worth the effort
2021-07-19 13:14:04	%Digerati	[21:38:52] for reference, if i put the hotspot itself outside on the ledge of my window, it can't connect to my 5 GHz router about 3m away, through the window
2021-07-19 13:14:04	%Digerati	[21:39:03] 2.4 GHz does work though
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:10] yeah

2021-07-19 13:14:04	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:20] 5ghz is notorious for getting absorbed
2021-07-19 13:14:04	%Digerati	[21:39:34] yup, you get faster speed in exchange for smaller range :P
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:43] not necessarily
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+JoseAlPaca	[21:39:52] the new standards all work in both ranges

2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[02:34:09] in duolingo there's this weekly competitive thing and got 1st place in my little group this week. hooray
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[02:47:02] SillyGoose:  what's the lol?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	%Digerati	[02:51:21] i think he meant narada 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+SillyGoose	[02:59:53] nesoi: oh yeah I meant narada
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+SillyGoose	[03:00:12] Sorry about that 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:00:18] oic
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:00:27] bryno:  what lang?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:01:46] japanese
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:05:11] bryno:  I started doing that too
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:05:23] can't remember the damned symbols that well tho
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:05:39] and I swear they try to trip you up so you'll lose lives and subscribe to the paid version
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:06:50] what level did you get to so far bryno?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:06:56] nesoi: are you doing it on the mobile app? they don't have that restriction on the website
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:07:22] website vs app is weird. some of the differences are a bit odd.
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:07:42] i'm on hiragana 4 -- not very far. :D
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:08:02] i max out on all of the levels before going to the next section
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:08:09] doing it on mobile
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:08:41] ah I already go to katakana 2
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:08:58] not that I know it or anything
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:09:52] haven't even gotten to katakana in the little character section part.
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:10:10] they suddenly throw in kanji without mentioning it
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:10:11] i'm trying to remember the characters, so doing all of the practices. lol
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:10:53] do you write notes while going through lessons?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:10:57] hm. so I should try the site
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:11:50] they don't have the heart thing on the website.
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:12:09] odd
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:12:20] i was confused what the hearts were. their reasoning is that you're making too many mistakes, so maybe you need a break. lol
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:13:20] then again, they don't have the character practice section on the website either
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:18:34] the desktop version doesn't have hearts 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:18:38] i mostly stick to that
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:20:09] good to know
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:27:31] obviyus:  what language(s) are you working on?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:27:39] nesoi: French
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:27:47] but i've only been studying a week so far 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:27:55] quelle domage
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:28:11] Pourquoi?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:28:35] "too bad"
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:28:40] :)
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:28:54] i think it means "what a shame" :>
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:28:54] I speak many languages very slightly
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:29:04] those are similar meanings
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:29:08] ah fair
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:29:34] but oui, i'm working on my pronunciations + vocabulary for now
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:29:45] pronunciation is tricky
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:29:48] are you a good mimick?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:30:03] i'm okay-ish, the r is giving me some trouble 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:30:15] how's your english? is it indian english, english engish, USA english, or australian etc ?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:30:41] i'm fairly certain it's British English 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:30:47] I once traded French lessons with a private teacher for accent lessons
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:30:55] I was teaching her how to get rid of her french accent
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:31:11] I think the French accent's cute 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:31:11] same thing happened that usually happens:
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:31:29] I got her to speak with an American accent and she hated the way it felt
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:31:34] hahahah
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:31:38] didn't want her mouth to do that stuff
2021-07-19 13:14:04	veganix	[03:31:43] obviyus: Pourquoi apprend-tu le français?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:32:11] veganix: i'm not very good yet but i'd guess you're asking the motivation behind me learning French 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	veganix	[03:32:22] obviyus: that's correct
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:32:26] :D
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:32:41] bunch of reasons but mostly immigration 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	veganix	[03:32:55] to?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:33:00] Canada'
2021-07-19 13:14:04	veganix	[03:33:27] Good luck
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:33:33] merci 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	veganix	[03:33:38] Where are you from?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:33:53] veganix: India 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:34:06] obviyus:  have family in canada?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:34:25] i do, but the vast vast majority of my family lives in the US
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:34:36] but you concluded that the US sucks so...
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:34:51] nesoi: no i'm not a part of the Reddit hate boner :>
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:34:58] but it does suck
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@narada	[03:34:59] canada does seem to be a better choice
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@narada	[03:35:06] if you get to choose
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:35:07] but i can't realistically move to the US long term
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:35:40] canada seems nicer
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:35:52] USA is too full of aggressive idiots
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:35:54] narada: coming from a third world country i'd say ANY western country that'll have me is better :)
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:36:11] obviyus:  why is your english so… grammatical? 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:36:26] nesoi: lol i don't really know how to answer that?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:36:44] studying since you were young or?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:37:00] English? probably the first language i ever learned
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:37:17] ah ok, why's that?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	 *	obviyus [03:37:21] shrugs 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:37:47] sorry don't mean to be nosey
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:37:56] nah you're not 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:38:05] but it's what most people around me use most often 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:38:13] that's a factor i'd guess 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:38:21] what's the 2nd language?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:38:28] Hindi, of course 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:38:44] I dunno… there are lots of languages in india
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:39:04] yeah, like 1,800 or so
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:39:12] yeah
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:39:12] my coworker (from india) says pretty much every state has its own language
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:39:36] yeah think we have like 22 official languages 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:39:45] a lot
2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[03:40:04] is hindi grammar similar to english or french?
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:40:09] but nearly everyone falls into the overlap of English + Hindi 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:40:16] nesoi: French for sure 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:40:28] pronunciations are consistent, nouns have genders 
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:40:55] how many genders? >_>
2021-07-19 13:14:04	@bryno	[03:40:58] jk
2021-07-19 13:14:04	+obviyus	[03:41:27] well officially the country recognizes two :>

2021-07-19 13:14:04	nesoi	[05:15:46] 5g?
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:15:50] you mean vaccine?
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:16:33] which carrier?
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:16:52] Unsure, AZ or Moderna
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:17:22] moderna is many times stronger, but also much less standard
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:17:44] AZ is made with a form of the spike that is not as good according to many/most
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:18:11] yah, but I'm worried about the heart inflammation with moderna, as I have a heart issue. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:18:29] ah. az doesn't have that too?
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:19:39] nah, just the clotting I think. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:20:03] not entirely sure
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:20:11] either way, I'll get something. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:20:21] ah
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:20:23] don't want to head back to school without it. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:20:26] it was after the 2nd dose
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:20:31] kids are germ factories. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:20:31] for moderna
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:20:39] so: get 1 dose of AZ and one of moderna
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:20:53] that's been tried and works well with AZ and Pfizer
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:20:56] should be the same
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:20:58] they haven't approved that here, yet, but I think they will. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:21:09] Pzifer arrives I think in September. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:21:35] hmm chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart after vaccination
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:21:40] I have that all the time!
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:21:50] not really
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:21:51] maybe it'll fix it?

2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:22:15] I had an irregular heartbeat the last few days. went to the ER yesterday and now this morning it's fine. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:22:32] incidence was about 1.3 per 100,000 doses
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:22:45] seems fairly low risk maybe
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:22:56] do you have an EKG?

2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:25:55] might pick one up, but usually I can tell when it's acting up. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:26:04] records to an app and you can send the trace to a dr
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:26:14] also they have online docs who will analyze for a small fee :)
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:27:25] I just book a doc here and walk to the hospital. I live 10 minutes from the best hopsital for cardiac stuff and can usually get in to see a doc in 1-3 days. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:27:53] sure but this way you can record it when it's happening
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:28:08] otherwise they do an EKG for 10 sec and if nothing is going on there, they see nothing
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:28:16] my ekg last night was off quite a bit.

2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:28:37] I'll ask the doc about it. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:28:51] Probably can get it on the health plan here. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:28:53] there are also these monitors you can glue on your chest for 2 weeks
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:29:41] any veterinarian-knowledgeable people here?
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:29:42] mine is mostly likely caused by aggravating an existing condition with too much caffeine and lack of sleep.

2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:31:28] are things starting to recover after the exodus?
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:31:43] I've read a lot of tech companies have left. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:32:03] or people are doing wfh from elsewhere. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:32:24] I don't know about tech companies that left
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:32:32] none of my tech friends lost a job except one
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:32:37] and he got a job working for the govt
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:33:44] he was doing sysops at a biotech anyway
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:34:09] i hear a lot of them are moving to texas for lower taxes
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:35:23] might just be misrepresented in the media then. narada, I've heard similar. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:36:15] the media does like to do that :)
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:36:30] maybe
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:36:37] texas seems like a hellhole though
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:36:41] sure does
2021-07-19 13:14:05	nesoi	[05:36:41] for heat if nothing else
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:37:02] i wouldn't want to move my business to a state that can't keep heat and AC on for its residents

2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:37:53] more that move there, the more likely it is to change, I would think.

2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:49:07] i'm hoping the market comes back down later this year
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:49:10] hopefully the market cools off
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:49:16] if it keeps going up eternally i will never afford a house :(
2021-07-19 13:14:05	sun-light	[05:49:40] It's going up ?
2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:49:47] I save a decent amount of cash every year, but still look at housing prices and what I'd get for it, and balk. 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	sun-light	[05:50:09] I thought with the covid etc will be more affordable
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:50:15] yes sun-light it's brutal right now. houses are like 30-50k overpriced from last year
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:50:21] they were last year sun-light 
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:50:26] this year everything shot up

2021-07-19 13:14:05	sun-light	[05:51:03] That's a lot
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:51:27] 30-50k$ is a huge amount, and if the market falls again that means you've overpaid 30-50k for a house you will never get that much money for when you try to sell it years later
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:51:59] interest rates are very low however
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:52:04] so that's a perk for some people
2021-07-19 13:14:05	sun-light	[05:52:20] So expensive
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[05:52:27] indeed
2021-07-19 13:14:05	sun-light	[05:52:49] Well I can be too picky..it's understandable

2021-07-19 13:14:05	kilroy	[05:58:42] We could pitch in and build a castle like the guy that made Bishop's Castle.

2021-07-19 13:14:05	+JoseAlPaca	[06:32:06] i wonder why muricans have such a fetish naming their kids after themselves
2021-07-19 13:14:05	+JoseAlPaca	[06:32:30] you see quite a lot people like that in public life
2021-07-19 13:14:05	%chik	[06:32:41] my mother did that
2021-07-19 13:14:05	%chik	[06:32:48] but she's definitely not american
2021-07-19 13:14:05	@narada	[06:33:03] i'd probably name my kid fbs
2021-07-19 13:14:05	%chik	[06:33:12] fubs
2021-07-19 13:14:05	+JoseAlPaca	[06:33:26] i'm quite an exception being named after my father, grandfather, great-grandfather, ... going back 200 years all had the same first or middle name for their first born males

2021-07-19 14:33:15	+SillyGoose	[03:00:12] Sorry about that 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:00:18] oic
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:00:27] bryno:  what lang?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:01:46] japanese
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:05:11] bryno:  I started doing that too
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:05:23] can't remember the damned symbols that well tho
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:05:39] and I swear they try to trip you up so you'll lose lives and subscribe to the paid version
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:06:50] what level did you get to so far bryno?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:06:56] nesoi: are you doing it on the mobile app? they don't have that restriction on the website
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:07:22] website vs app is weird. some of the differences are a bit odd.
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:07:42] i'm on hiragana 4 -- not very far. :D
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:08:02] i max out on all of the levels before going to the next section
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:08:09] doing it on mobile
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:08:41] ah I already go to katakana 2
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:08:58] not that I know it or anything
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:09:52] haven't even gotten to katakana in the little character section part.
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:10:10] they suddenly throw in kanji without mentioning it
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:10:11] i'm trying to remember the characters, so doing all of the practices. lol
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:10:53] do you write notes while going through lessons?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:10:57] hm. so I should try the site
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:11:50] they don't have the heart thing on the website.
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:12:09] odd
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:12:20] i was confused what the hearts were. their reasoning is that you're making too many mistakes, so maybe you need a break. lol
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:13:20] then again, they don't have the character practice section on the website either
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:18:34] the desktop version doesn't have hearts 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:18:38] i mostly stick to that
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:20:09] good to know
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:27:31] obviyus:  what language(s) are you working on?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:27:39] nesoi: French
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:27:47] but i've only been studying a week so far 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:27:55] quelle domage
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:28:11] Pourquoi?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:28:35] "too bad"
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:28:40] :)
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:28:54] i think it means "what a shame" :>
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:28:54] I speak many languages very slightly
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:29:04] those are similar meanings
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:29:08] ah fair
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:29:34] but oui, i'm working on my pronunciations + vocabulary for now
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:29:45] pronunciation is tricky
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:29:48] are you a good mimick?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:30:03] i'm okay-ish, the r is giving me some trouble 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:30:15] how's your english? is it indian english, english engish, USA english, or australian etc ?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:30:41] i'm fairly certain it's British English 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:30:47] I once traded French lessons with a private teacher for accent lessons
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:30:55] I was teaching her how to get rid of her french accent
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:31:11] I think the French accent's cute 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:31:11] same thing happened that usually happens:
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:31:29] I got her to speak with an American accent and she hated the way it felt
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:31:34] hahahah
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:31:38] didn't want her mouth to do that stuff
2021-07-19 14:33:15	veganix	[03:31:43] obviyus: Pourquoi apprend-tu le français?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:32:11] veganix: i'm not very good yet but i'd guess you're asking the motivation behind me learning French 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	veganix	[03:32:22] obviyus: that's correct
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:32:26] :D
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:32:41] bunch of reasons but mostly immigration 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	veganix	[03:32:55] to?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:33:00] Canada'
2021-07-19 14:33:15	veganix	[03:33:27] Good luck
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:33:33] merci 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	veganix	[03:33:38] Where are you from?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:33:53] veganix: India 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:34:06] obviyus:  have family in canada?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:34:25] i do, but the vast vast majority of my family lives in the US
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:34:36] but you concluded that the US sucks so...
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:34:51] nesoi: no i'm not a part of the Reddit hate boner :>
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:34:58] but it does suck
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@narada	[03:34:59] canada does seem to be a better choice
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@narada	[03:35:06] if you get to choose
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:35:07] but i can't realistically move to the US long term
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:35:40] canada seems nicer
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:35:52] USA is too full of aggressive idiots
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:35:54] narada: coming from a third world country i'd say ANY western country that'll have me is better :)
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:36:11] obviyus:  why is your english so… grammatical? 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:36:26] nesoi: lol i don't really know how to answer that?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:36:44] studying since you were young or?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:37:00] English? probably the first language i ever learned
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:37:17] ah ok, why's that?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	 *	obviyus [03:37:21] shrugs 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:37:47] sorry don't mean to be nosey
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:37:56] nah you're not 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:38:05] but it's what most people around me use most often 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:38:13] that's a factor i'd guess 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:38:21] what's the 2nd language?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:38:28] Hindi, of course 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:38:44] I dunno… there are lots of languages in india
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:39:04] yeah, like 1,800 or so
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:39:12] yeah
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:39:12] my coworker (from india) says pretty much every state has its own language
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:39:36] yeah think we have like 22 official languages 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:39:45] a lot
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[03:40:04] is hindi grammar similar to english or french?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:40:09] but nearly everyone falls into the overlap of English + Hindi 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:40:16] nesoi: French for sure 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:40:28] pronunciations are consistent, nouns have genders 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:40:55] how many genders? >_>
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@bryno	[03:40:58] jk
2021-07-19 14:33:15	+obviyus	[03:41:27] well officially the country recognizes two :>

2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:04:42] I get my 5g on Wednesday it seems. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	@narada	[05:09:37] hope it goes well for you kilroy 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:15:46] 5g?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:15:50] you mean vaccine?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:16:33] which carrier?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:16:52] Unsure, AZ or Moderna
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:17:22] moderna is many times stronger, but also much less standard
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:17:44] AZ is made with a form of the spike that is not as good according to many/most
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:18:11] yah, but I'm worried about the heart inflammation with moderna, as I have a heart issue. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:18:29] ah. az doesn't have that too?
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:19:39] nah, just the clotting I think. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:20:03] not entirely sure
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:20:11] either way, I'll get something. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:20:21] ah
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:20:23] don't want to head back to school without it. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:20:26] it was after the 2nd dose
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:20:31] kids are germ factories. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:20:31] for moderna
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:20:39] so: get 1 dose of AZ and one of moderna
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:20:53] that's been tried and works well with AZ and Pfizer
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:20:56] should be the same
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:20:58] they haven't approved that here, yet, but I think they will. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:21:09] Pzifer arrives I think in September. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:21:35] hmm chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart after vaccination
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:21:40] I have that all the time!
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:21:50] not really
2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:21:51] maybe it'll fix it?

2021-07-19 14:33:15	kilroy	[05:22:15] I had an irregular heartbeat the last few days. went to the ER yesterday and now this morning it's fine. 
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:22:32] incidence was about 1.3 per 100,000 doses
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:22:45] seems fairly low risk maybe
2021-07-19 14:33:15	nesoi	[05:22:56] do you have an EKG?

2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:25:55] might pick one up, but usually I can tell when it's acting up. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:26:04] records to an app and you can send the trace to a dr
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:26:14] also they have online docs who will analyze for a small fee :)
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:27:25] I just book a doc here and walk to the hospital. I live 10 minutes from the best hopsital for cardiac stuff and can usually get in to see a doc in 1-3 days. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:27:53] sure but this way you can record it when it's happening
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:28:08] otherwise they do an EKG for 10 sec and if nothing is going on there, they see nothing
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:28:16] my ekg last night was off quite a bit.

2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:28:37] I'll ask the doc about it. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:28:51] Probably can get it on the health plan here. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:28:53] there are also these monitors you can glue on your chest for 2 weeks
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:29:41] any veterinarian-knowledgeable people here?
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:29:42] mine is mostly likely caused by aggravating an existing condition with too much caffeine and lack of sleep.

2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:31:28] are things starting to recover after the exodus?
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:31:43] I've read a lot of tech companies have left. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:32:03] or people are doing wfh from elsewhere. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:32:24] I don't know about tech companies that left
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:32:32] none of my tech friends lost a job except one
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:32:37] and he got a job working for the govt
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:33:44] he was doing sysops at a biotech anyway

2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:35:23] might just be misrepresented in the media then. narada, I've heard similar. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:36:15] the media does like to do that :)
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:36:30] maybe
2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:36:37] texas seems like a hellhole though

2021-07-19 14:33:16	nesoi	[05:36:41] for heat if nothing else
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:37:02] i wouldn't want to move my business to a state that can't keep heat and AC on for its residents

2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:37:53] more that move there, the more likely it is to change, I would think.

2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:49:07] i'm hoping the market comes back down later this year
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:49:10] hopefully the market cools off
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:49:16] if it keeps going up eternally i will never afford a house :(
2021-07-19 14:33:16	sun-light	[05:49:40] It's going up ?
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:49:47] I save a decent amount of cash every year, but still look at housing prices and what I'd get for it, and balk. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	sun-light	[05:50:09] I thought with the covid etc will be more affordable
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:50:15] yes sun-light it's brutal right now. houses are like 30-50k overpriced from last year
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:50:21] they were last year sun-light 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:50:26] this year everything shot up

2021-07-19 14:33:16	sun-light	[05:51:03] That's a lot
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:51:27] 30-50k$ is a huge amount, and if the market falls again that means you've overpaid 30-50k for a house you will never get that much money for when you try to sell it years later
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:51:59] interest rates are very low however
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:52:04] so that's a perk for some people
2021-07-19 14:33:16	sun-light	[05:52:20] So expensive
2021-07-19 14:33:16	@narada	[05:52:27] indeed
2021-07-19 14:33:16	sun-light	[05:52:49] Well I can be too picky..it's understandable

2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:58:14] Delta county, Colorado has no building laws. You can build and live in whatever you want. 
2021-07-19 14:33:16	kilroy	[05:58:42] We could pitch in and build a castle like the guy that made Bishop's Castle.

2021-07-19 18:40:02	nesoi	[05:22:56] do you have an EKG?

2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[05:25:55] might pick one up, but usually I can tell when it's acting up. 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nesoi	[05:26:04] records to an app and you can send the trace to a dr
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nesoi	[05:26:14] also they have online docs who will analyze for a small fee :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[05:27:25] I just book a doc here and walk to the hospital. I live 10 minutes from the best hopsital for cardiac stuff and can usually get in to see a doc in 1-3 days. 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nesoi	[05:27:53] sure but this way you can record it when it's happening
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nesoi	[05:28:08] otherwise they do an EKG for 10 sec and if nothing is going on there, they see nothing

2021-07-19 18:40:02	nesoi	[05:37:17] right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[05:37:53] more that move there, the more likely it is to change, I would think. 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:38:10] that would make sense

2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:45:28] Yes, I am good now
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:45:56] were you having connection issues to irc or just taking a break?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:46:08] I need to get IrcCloud
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:46:11] Yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:46:15] ahh
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:46:28] This app don't work really good
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:46:44] :(
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:46:50] i've yet to find a good irc phone app
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:46:56] debated setting up weechat relay
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:47:34] Sounds good. I'll download today IrcCloud to see if dc or not
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:47:58] nice
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:48:29] Did you get a house in the end ?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:48:37] nope still looking :(
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:48:48] almost made an offer on one but didn't pan out
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:48:56] Working in progress
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:48:59] yeah
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:49:07] i'm hoping the market comes back down later this year
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[05:49:10] hopefully the market cools off
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:49:16] if it keeps going up eternally i will never afford a house :(
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:49:40] It's going up ?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[05:49:47] I save a decent amount of cash every year, but still look at housing prices and what I'd get for it, and balk. 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:50:09] I thought with the covid etc will be more affordable
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:50:15] yes sun-light it's brutal right now. houses are like 30-50k overpriced from last year
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:50:21] they were last year sun-light 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:50:26] this year everything shot up
2021-07-19 18:40:02	chik	[05:50:33] everyone wants offices at home now
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:50:36] i should've bought last year but i was too picky :(
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:50:47] i could afford a house last year but not really this year lol
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:50:55] Oh wow narada
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:51:03] That's a lot
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:51:27] 30-50k$ is a huge amount, and if the market falls again that means you've overpaid 30-50k for a house you will never get that much money for when you try to sell it years later
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:51:59] interest rates are very low however
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:52:04] so that's a perk for some people
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:52:20] So expensive
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:52:27] indeed
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:52:49] Well I can be too picky..it's understandable
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:53:11] hehe
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:53:54] Not sure here how the market is
2021-07-19 18:40:02	chik	[05:54:19] too expensive
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:54:35] It can be, chik, yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	chik	[05:54:53] ppl are buying houses and not looked at them
2021-07-19 18:40:02	chik	[05:55:04] some even before hitting the market
2021-07-19 18:40:02	chik	[05:55:08] or being listed 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:57:36] chik is right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:57:39] my buddy did that
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:57:46] bought a house with foundation issues lool
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[05:58:05] gonna be like $10k of work
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[05:58:14] Delta county, Colorado has no building laws. You can build and live in whatever you want. 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[05:58:42] We could pitch in and build a castle like the guy that made Bishop's Castle. 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:58:46] 2 of my work mates got a House (last year)..they were happy with the price. But took ages to be approved by solicitors..so much paperwork and pressure.

2021-07-19 18:40:02	sun-light	[05:59:49] Colorado. Beautiful place

2021-07-19 18:40:02	chik	[06:32:41] my mother did that
2021-07-19 18:40:02	chik	[06:32:48] but she's definitely not american
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[06:33:03] i'd probably name my kid fbs

2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[10:01:34] so, html has been around for well over 2 decades now, so why the fuck is it still such a pain in the ass to vertically center content in a div?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@jvoisin	[10:03:45] it's not
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@jvoisin	[10:03:47] thanks to css3
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[10:08:37] vertical-align doesn't work half the time. 
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kilroy	[10:11:16] or you need to wrap it in display: table-cell, which makes no sense.

2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:38:13] i dont buy, but if i did, i wud agree
2021-07-19 18:40:02	+fbs	[11:38:18] steph020: can recommend a deanston 12, not as expensive but good dram
2021-07-19 18:40:02	+fbs	[11:38:28] macallan tends to cost $$$$$$$$$
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:39:02] she wanted me to try herb, i told her it makes me caugh
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:39:18] ahhh herb not cigs
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:39:24] that's not near as bad
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:39:31] but if you don't like it, don't do it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:39:41] so gaining a middle, i find a fair few men seem to like me curvy
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:39:59] hehe
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:40:11] and learnikng to get drunk, a totally new experience
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:40:12] everyone has their own types they prefer i guess
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:40:53] I told her i would do the 2 vices if i could work only 2 days a week instead of 5.  she agreed
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:41:26] lol nice deal there
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:41:38] as long as you got money for bills
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:42:09] its sorta 3 vices, i always found dating same gender a bit self indulgent since women have always seemed easier to get along with for me
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:42:30] nothing wrong with that
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:42:41] she makes good coin.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:42:52] :D excellent

2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:44:05] girls i went to college with.  I am barely holding on to thinnest one badge.  but i wont for long.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:44:54] she seems  to love me.  i love her i guess.  I never fully understood lesbian friends.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:45:37] in simple terms, she is soft and tender, loving
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:45:46] i like those attributes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:45:53] sounds nice
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:46:14] i dated guys for a few years
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:46:41] and guys are less loving i think.  
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:47:03] i guess you are a guy that dates women?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:48:40] guys have one great attribute, they can pork me better than any girl.  And i love a nice hide and peek

2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:58:05] my gf asked me year and half ago, if i wud gain 40 lbs for her at some point, i have gained 30ish so far, But the task has backfired a bit, she has also gained.  shrug, so much for the cute thin couple.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	@narada	[11:58:50] she asked for it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[11:59:42] i have always found weight an odd thing, insofar as people that like thin or curvy.  The biggest surprise to me is how easily i gained.  that is a totally new discovery
2021-07-19 18:40:02	steph020	[12:00:39] as for her, i am not sure she realizes she is rounder.

2021-07-20 10:40:19	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:40] so obviously it's the back of the head
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[16:01:02] haha, fair enough :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+JoseAlPaca	[16:01:17] \o <- in this case, the eyes are too small. so obviously it's from the front

2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[16:02:02] it is literally dripping from my arms :o

2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[16:03:23] i "googled" excessive perspiration (but in swedish) and ended up on our governmental site for health advice
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[16:03:36] one of the treatments is to use microwaves to destroy the sweat glands o_O

2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[16:04:51] as for the reasons:
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[16:05:34] "you're overweight, drink too much alcohole, have diabetes, manopause, bieffect from medication, social anxiety, some long lasting infection... some kind of cancer...
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+JoseAlPaca	[16:05:59] mhm
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+Libre___	[16:06:03] I still sweat a lot, but losing weight has helped with it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[16:06:04] so, it's either some long lasting infection... or diabetes then
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+JoseAlPaca	[16:06:11] definitely your overwweight and menopause are the reasons
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[16:06:19] haha, indeed
2021-07-20 10:40:19	 *	zelest [16:06:31] is 180cm tall and weight 65kg

2021-07-20 10:40:19	&kylef	[17:43:45] I was considering the latter there, maybe a good opportunity for vacation without other people being around
2021-07-20 10:40:19	&Derecho	[17:43:57] not really get much chance to relax or even focus on your own objectives
2021-07-20 10:40:19	&Derecho	[17:44:42] kylef: could be good! try not to go to a too popular beach though otherwise you're still surrounded with people, even if they're not necessarily talking to you

2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:44:05] nothing really.. it was just very beta when I tried last time
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:44:16] 'ifconfig wg0 destroy' gave me a panic back then
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:44:24] and I didn't care to continue fiddling :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:44:29] seems to be more mature by now
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+garandil	[22:44:49] its your OS zelest , not wireguard :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:45:27] garandil, it was.. and it was the official wireguard dev that ported that stuff to my OS :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:45:46] also, I tried it in -current, where one expect it to be dragons :)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+garandil	[22:45:58] :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:46:03] my OS loves wireguard

2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:46:39] that shirt is twice as cool now
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:46:51] they pulled it from the store due to copyright infringement
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+zelest	[22:46:57] but I got mine before it was pulled :D

2021-07-20 10:40:19	+JoseAlPaca	[23:08:21] huh
2021-07-20 10:40:19	 *	JoseAlPaca [23:08:35] suddenly comprehends why avidemux just died earlier

2021-07-20 10:40:19	 *	JoseAlPaca [23:08:47] grmls
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:13:02] Digerati:  damn dude, i should of listened when i had a chance to get those helium miners or at least get on a waitlist. everyones no longer taking orders cause so many of them are so backed up 
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:13:49] yeah i heard there are like 250k backordered
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:13:52] general estimate
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:16:55] doesnt surprise me, someone told me about them in another channel like 8 months ago and it was already backed up then.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:17:05] i have 8 nebras coming hopefully this month or possibly next month
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:17:27] thats awesome,  at least i get a bit of time to get people on board
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:17:46] as soon as they are available i want to order like 10 
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:18:04] well, a halving is happening on august 1
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:18:13] whats that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:18:14] so all rewards issued will be halved then
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:18:26] generally when that happens with cryptos, the value goes up
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:18:31] not always though
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:18:31] oh that sucks, so ive missed the peak again 
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:32:08] well it has always been known that as more and more hotspots go online, the fewer rewards each will get on average
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:32:33] as there's a fixed amount of HNT mined each epoch
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:40:04] so prob still a great time to get on board
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:40:22] i checked the map and in sydney there is only a few people mining it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:41:15] yeah, the best places to join today are where there are few hotspots
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:42:36] the optimal number of witnesses for hotspots is 4 currently (set by a chain variable so it can be changed, but it has been that for a while, primarily because unlike regular cell towers, hotspots are generally running on residential internet that may not be really reliable, so having 4x coverage is deemed ideal for network reliability and usage at any given location)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:43:51] i was going to get 3 but now im thinking 4
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:44:28] well with minimum 12-20 week lead time, chances are good that hotspots will be popping up around you over the next few months before you receive yours
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:44:41] already know where they are going, one at my mums house then at my fiances mums house and then my grandparents house. they are roughly 5 miles from each other 
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:45:11] might have to get a higher gain antenna and decent elevation for them to see each other
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:45:20] yeah going to be a interested few months, saw the aus one is shipping out october so i guess we will see how many people in sydney are invested in octoboer 
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:45:20] lorawan is mostly a line of sight network
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:45:35] you can see the hotspot statistics here: https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:45:41] the number that have been coming online is crazy
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:45:56] went from 62k to 91k over the past 30 days
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:46:10] yeah i need to do a proper deep dive and learn how all this works, at the moment i have a tldr amount of knownledge 
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:46:59] this is important reading for determining optimal hotspot placement in terms of rewards: https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md
2021-07-20 10:40:19	@zeta	[00:47:00] ‡ HIP/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md at master · helium/HIP · GitHub
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:47:13] it's fairly complex
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:47:44] https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0015-beaconing-rewards.md as well
2021-07-20 10:40:19	@zeta	[00:47:44] ‡ HIP/0015-beaconing-rewards.md at master · helium/HIP · GitHub
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:47:59] those are the two major one discussing how rewards are issued to hotspots
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:50:23] so its a combination of distance and numbers to optimize rewards. 
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:50:45] ive been thinking cause i work with independent petrol stations, would it be that hard to go into each site and install one without them knowing
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:51:38] nope, wouldn't be at all, as long as you have a decent way to power it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:51:48] and connect to the internet
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:51:59] some people use mobile hotspots if they're not in range of wifi
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[00:53:13] do they need to constantly be connected to the internet?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:53:27] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:53:36] well, when it's not, you won't get any rewards
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:54:10] i've read that some people have a solar panel/mobile hotspot setup that doesn't need any kind of physical connectivity at all
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:54:32] that's pretty cool, you could just climb a tree and mount it up there :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	%Digerati	[00:55:23] best way to increase range and # witnesses and rewards is to put the antenna as high as possible, even a 1m height difference has been shown to have a significant effect on range
2021-07-20 10:40:19	+SillyGoose	[00:56:18] you got an equation for that? :P

2021-07-20 10:40:19	nesoi	[02:46:08] yes if they are death cap mushrooms
2021-07-20 10:40:19	vaquero	[02:46:46] first off if your taking  death cap mushrooms then your already doing magic mushrooms wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nesoi	[02:47:20] death is magic

2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:00:18] maybe the guy is facing you.. or not..
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:19] o/ <- the right one ofc

2021-07-20 10:40:40	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:40] so obviously it's the back of the head
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:01:02] haha, fair enough :P
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+JoseAlPaca	[16:01:17] \o <- in this case, the eyes are too small. so obviously it's from the front
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:01:52] dafuq.. i have problems with perspiration :o
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:02:02] it is literally dripping from my arms :o

2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:03:23] i "googled" excessive perspiration (but in swedish) and ended up on our governmental site for health advice
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:03:36] one of the treatments is to use microwaves to destroy the sweat glands o_O
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+JoseAlPaca	[16:04:22] lolwut
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:04:51] as for the reasons:
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:05:34] "you're overweight, drink too much alcohole, have diabetes, manopause, bieffect from medication, social anxiety, some long lasting infection... some kind of cancer...
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+JoseAlPaca	[16:05:59] mhm
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+Libre___	[16:06:03] I still sweat a lot, but losing weight has helped with it
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:06:04] so, it's either some long lasting infection... or diabetes then
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+JoseAlPaca	[16:06:11] definitely your overwweight and menopause are the reasons
2021-07-20 10:40:40	+zelest	[16:06:19] haha, indeed
2021-07-20 10:40:40	 *	zelest [16:06:31] is 180cm tall and weight 65kg

2021-07-20 10:40:40	&Derecho	[17:43:14] it's just that travelling to see family results in a *very* different experience than let's say, going camping in the woods
2021-07-20 10:40:40	&Derecho	[17:43:34] or the beach for that matter
2021-07-20 10:40:40	&kylef	[17:43:45] I was considering the latter there, maybe a good opportunity for vacation without other people being around
2021-07-20 10:40:40	&Derecho	[17:43:57] not really get much chance to relax or even focus on your own objectives
2021-07-20 10:40:40	&Derecho	[17:44:42] kylef: could be good! try not to go to a too popular beach though otherwise you're still surrounded with people, even if they're not necessarily talking to you

2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:17:46] as soon as they are available i want to order like 10 
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:18:04] well, a halving is happening on august 1
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:18:13] whats that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:18:14] so all rewards issued will be halved then
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:18:26] generally when that happens with cryptos, the value goes up
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:18:31] not always though
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:18:31] oh that sucks, so ive missed the peak again 
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:32:08] well it has always been known that as more and more hotspots go online, the fewer rewards each will get on average
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:32:33] as there's a fixed amount of HNT mined each epoch
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:40:04] so prob still a great time to get on board
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:40:22] i checked the map and in sydney there is only a few people mining it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:41:15] yeah, the best places to join today are where there are few hotspots
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:42:36] the optimal number of witnesses for hotspots is 4 currently (set by a chain variable so it can be changed, but it has been that for a while, primarily because unlike regular cell towers, hotspots are generally running on residential internet that may not be really reliable, so having 4x coverage is deemed ideal for network reliability and usage at any given location)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:43:51] i was going to get 3 but now im thinking 4
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:44:28] well with minimum 12-20 week lead time, chances are good that hotspots will be popping up around you over the next few months before you receive yours
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:44:41] already know where they are going, one at my mums house then at my fiances mums house and then my grandparents house. they are roughly 5 miles from each other 
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:45:11] might have to get a higher gain antenna and decent elevation for them to see each other
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:45:20] yeah going to be a interested few months, saw the aus one is shipping out october so i guess we will see how many people in sydney are invested in octoboer 
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:45:20] lorawan is mostly a line of sight network
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:45:35] you can see the hotspot statistics here: https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:45:41] the number that have been coming online is crazy
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:45:56] went from 62k to 91k over the past 30 days
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:46:10] yeah i need to do a proper deep dive and learn how all this works, at the moment i have a tldr amount of knownledge 
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:46:59] this is important reading for determining optimal hotspot placement in terms of rewards: https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md
2021-07-20 10:40:41	@zeta	[00:47:00] ‡ HIP/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md at master · helium/HIP · GitHub
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:47:13] it's fairly complex
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:47:44] https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0015-beaconing-rewards.md as well
2021-07-20 10:40:41	@zeta	[00:47:44] ‡ HIP/0015-beaconing-rewards.md at master · helium/HIP · GitHub
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:47:59] those are the two major one discussing how rewards are issued to hotspots
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:50:23] so its a combination of distance and numbers to optimize rewards. 
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:50:45] ive been thinking cause i work with independent petrol stations, would it be that hard to go into each site and install one without them knowing
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:51:38] nope, wouldn't be at all, as long as you have a decent way to power it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:51:48] and connect to the internet
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:51:59] some people use mobile hotspots if they're not in range of wifi
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vaquero	[00:53:13] do they need to constantly be connected to the internet?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:53:27] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:53:36] well, when it's not, you won't get any rewards
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:54:10] i've read that some people have a solar panel/mobile hotspot setup that doesn't need any kind of physical connectivity at all
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:54:32] that's pretty cool, you could just climb a tree and mount it up there :P
2021-07-20 10:40:41	%Digerati	[00:55:23] best way to increase range and # witnesses and rewards is to put the antenna as high as possible, even a 1m height difference has been shown to have a significant effect on range
2021-07-20 10:40:41	+SillyGoose	[00:56:18] you got an equation for that? :P

2021-07-20 11:28:45	@jvoisin	[14:55:45] there are a lot of "cebebrities" who dated/are dating younglings
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[14:55:51] Might be victim blaming, but I wouldn't really expect dating manson to be a sane or healthy relationship at all
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[14:56:53] Either way, Manson stopped being cool when he kicked John 5 and became a diva
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[14:58:59] Heh, played with Burp the other day on my format employers site... didn't find anything interesting and decided to play with my companys website instead..
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[14:59:17] Within 5 minutes I had mail notifications about SQL errors :(
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[14:59:24] All patched now though \o/

2021-07-20 11:28:45	manicennui	[15:04:30] Did I join #qanon?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	chik	[15:04:51] heh
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+Requit	[15:04:52] Worse, you joined reality
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[15:08:45] should be in #politics and I shouldn't get upset.. but QAnon is such a joke.. it's as much of a group or organization as Al-Qaeda is/was...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[15:09:11] now, off to bike home :)

2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[15:58:49] JoseAlPaca, the right arm?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[15:59:44] ofc
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[15:59:50] i'm german
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[15:59:59] how do you know which arm I used? :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:03] i know which one is supposed to use!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:00:18] maybe the guy is facing you.. or not..
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:19] o/ <- the right one ofc
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:29] i don't see eyes there - do you?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:40] so obviously it's the back of the head
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:01:02] haha, fair enough :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:01:17] \o <- in this case, the eyes are too small. so obviously it's from the front
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:01:52] dafuq.. i have problems with perspiration :o
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:02:02] it is literally dripping from my arms :o
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:02:07] and it's not even warm
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:02:58] jesus fucking christ
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:03:23] i "googled" excessive perspiration (but in swedish) and ended up on our governmental site for health advice
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:03:36] one of the treatments is to use microwaves to destroy the sweat glands o_O
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:04:22] lolwut
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:04:51] as for the reasons:
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:05:34] "you're overweight, drink too much alcohole, have diabetes, manopause, bieffect from medication, social anxiety, some long lasting infection... some kind of cancer...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:05:59] mhm
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+Libre___	[16:06:03] I still sweat a lot, but losing weight has helped with it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:06:04] so, it's either some long lasting infection... or diabetes then
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:06:11] definitely your overwweight and menopause are the reasons
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:06:19] haha, indeed
2021-07-20 11:28:45	 *	zelest [16:06:31] is 180cm tall and weight 65kg
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:06:45] yeah, obv your scale is broken
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:07:00] yeah, it's hiding the heading 2 :D

2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:07:45] mhm
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:07:47] alzheimer's, too
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:07:54] let's not forget the aids
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[16:08:09] no, but serously, I sweat like a pig, everyday
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:08:11] boy
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:08:24] you'd have a field day with my swedish ex
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:08:52] the sole mention of an infections disease had her panicking
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+Requit	[16:21:23] What about something tame like leprosy
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:30:23] pft
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:30:25] too obvious
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[16:30:42] can't tease someone with having it maybe cause everyone knows

2021-07-20 11:28:45	&Derecho	[17:42:23] so far quite tiring
2021-07-20 11:28:45	&Derecho	[17:42:28] but I'm in a decent mood :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	chik	[17:42:36] good good
2021-07-20 11:28:45	&Derecho	[17:43:14] it's just that travelling to see family results in a *very* different experience than let's say, going camping in the woods
2021-07-20 11:28:45	&Derecho	[17:43:34] or the beach for that matter
2021-07-20 11:28:45	&kylef	[17:43:45] I was considering the latter there, maybe a good opportunity for vacation without other people being around
2021-07-20 11:28:45	&Derecho	[17:43:57] not really get much chance to relax or even focus on your own objectives
2021-07-20 11:28:45	&Derecho	[17:44:42] kylef: could be good! try not to go to a too popular beach though otherwise you're still surrounded with people, even if they're not necessarily talking to you
2021-07-20 11:28:45	&kylef	[17:46:47] Derecho: i thinking something like middle of nowhere scotland or something like that

2021-07-20 11:28:45	manicennui	[18:21:07] I'm sure much of Iceland is at a higher elevation too, so Hafthor might have a similar advantage.

2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[21:15:43] which is why i'm grabbing 5 with this order
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[21:16:01] doubt they'll last longer, though. so maybe i should make myself go shop each time i want them
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[21:16:23] i am loath to admit but they do indeed beat my selfmade ones
2021-07-20 11:28:45	chik	[21:16:51] bold statement

2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[21:23:50] indeed
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[21:23:56] that's why you're taller than me

2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[21:24:54] here i go and bare my soul and all i get is ridicule. typical. everybody hates white, middle-aged, all-knowing males
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[21:25:18] i forgot omnipotent
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[21:25:29] grumpy isn't a deadly sin
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[21:25:34] the closest would probably be wrath
2021-07-20 11:28:45	chik	[21:28:36] what dwarf is Digerati ?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	 *	JoseAlPaca [21:29:57] votes for happy
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[21:30:21] even when i wanted to strangle him i never noticed him to be even slightly unhappy :D
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[21:30:30] :D:D:D
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[21:30:33] happy sounds good to me
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+Requit	[21:36:46] I'm the eigth sin, despondance.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	chik	[21:37:20] being sad is depressed is not a sin Requit 
2021-07-20 11:28:45	chik	[21:37:27] s/is/and
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+Cardinal	[21:37:27] chik meant: being sad and depressed is not a sin Requit
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+Requit	[21:37:38] No but rejecting the beauty of God's creation to wallow in your sadness is.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+Requit	[21:37:42] Or at least, was historically.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+SillyGoose	[21:50:49] How is Requit today?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+Requit	[21:53:00] Killing time until it kills me, SillyGoose.

2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[22:42:46] what was so iffy about it?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:44:05] nothing really.. it was just very beta when I tried last time
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:44:16] 'ifconfig wg0 destroy' gave me a panic back then
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:44:24] and I didn't care to continue fiddling :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:44:29] seems to be more mature by now
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+garandil	[22:44:49] its your OS zelest , not wireguard :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:45:27] garandil, it was.. and it was the official wireguard dev that ported that stuff to my OS :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:45:46] also, I tried it in -current, where one expect it to be dragons :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+garandil	[22:45:58] :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:46:03] my OS loves wireguard
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:46:06] look: https://ifconfig.se/wg.jpg
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:46:13] look how happy they look :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+garandil	[22:46:23] lol
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:46:39] that shirt is twice as cool now
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:46:51] they pulled it from the store due to copyright infringement
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+zelest	[22:46:57] but I got mine before it was pulled :D
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nesoi	[22:54:43] hi SillyGoose!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nesoi	[22:54:46] everyone
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[23:08:21] huh
2021-07-20 11:28:45	 *	JoseAlPaca [23:08:35] suddenly comprehends why avidemux just died earlier
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+JoseAlPaca	[23:08:43] ffmpeg was built without nonfree
2021-07-20 11:28:45	 *	JoseAlPaca [23:08:47] grmls
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:13:02] Digerati:  damn dude, i should of listened when i had a chance to get those helium miners or at least get on a waitlist. everyones no longer taking orders cause so many of them are so backed up 
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:13:49] yeah i heard there are like 250k backordered
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:13:52] general estimate
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:16:55] doesnt surprise me, someone told me about them in another channel like 8 months ago and it was already backed up then.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:17:05] i have 8 nebras coming hopefully this month or possibly next month
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:17:27] thats awesome,  at least i get a bit of time to get people on board
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:17:46] as soon as they are available i want to order like 10 
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:18:04] well, a halving is happening on august 1
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:18:13] whats that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:18:14] so all rewards issued will be halved then
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:18:26] generally when that happens with cryptos, the value goes up
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:18:31] not always though
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:18:31] oh that sucks, so ive missed the peak again 
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:32:08] well it has always been known that as more and more hotspots go online, the fewer rewards each will get on average
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:32:33] as there's a fixed amount of HNT mined each epoch
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:40:04] so prob still a great time to get on board
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:40:22] i checked the map and in sydney there is only a few people mining it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:41:15] yeah, the best places to join today are where there are few hotspots
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:42:36] the optimal number of witnesses for hotspots is 4 currently (set by a chain variable so it can be changed, but it has been that for a while, primarily because unlike regular cell towers, hotspots are generally running on residential internet that may not be really reliable, so having 4x coverage is deemed ideal for network reliability and usage at any given location)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:43:51] i was going to get 3 but now im thinking 4
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:44:28] well with minimum 12-20 week lead time, chances are good that hotspots will be popping up around you over the next few months before you receive yours
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:44:41] already know where they are going, one at my mums house then at my fiances mums house and then my grandparents house. they are roughly 5 miles from each other 
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:45:11] might have to get a higher gain antenna and decent elevation for them to see each other
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:45:20] yeah going to be a interested few months, saw the aus one is shipping out october so i guess we will see how many people in sydney are invested in octoboer 
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:45:20] lorawan is mostly a line of sight network
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:45:35] you can see the hotspot statistics here: https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:45:41] the number that have been coming online is crazy
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:45:56] went from 62k to 91k over the past 30 days
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:46:10] yeah i need to do a proper deep dive and learn how all this works, at the moment i have a tldr amount of knownledge 
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:46:59] this is important reading for determining optimal hotspot placement in terms of rewards: https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md

2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:47:13] it's fairly complex
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:47:44] https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0015-beaconing-rewards.md as well

2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:47:59] those are the two major one discussing how rewards are issued to hotspots
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:50:23] so its a combination of distance and numbers to optimize rewards. 
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:50:45] ive been thinking cause i work with independent petrol stations, would it be that hard to go into each site and install one without them knowing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:51:38] nope, wouldn't be at all, as long as you have a decent way to power it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:51:48] and connect to the internet
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:51:59] some people use mobile hotspots if they're not in range of wifi
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vaquero	[00:53:13] do they need to constantly be connected to the internet?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:53:27] yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:53:36] well, when it's not, you won't get any rewards
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:54:10] i've read that some people have a solar panel/mobile hotspot setup that doesn't need any kind of physical connectivity at all
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:54:32] that's pretty cool, you could just climb a tree and mount it up there :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	%Digerati	[00:55:23] best way to increase range and # witnesses and rewards is to put the antenna as high as possible, even a 1m height difference has been shown to have a significant effect on range
2021-07-20 11:28:45	+SillyGoose	[00:56:18] you got an equation for that? :P

2021-07-20 11:29:00	@jvoisin	[14:51:01] unsurprisingly, ~old people dating young women tend to groom/abuse them

2021-07-20 11:29:00	@jvoisin	[14:55:45] there are a lot of "cebebrities" who dated/are dating younglings
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[14:55:51] Might be victim blaming, but I wouldn't really expect dating manson to be a sane or healthy relationship at all
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[14:56:53] Either way, Manson stopped being cool when he kicked John 5 and became a diva
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[14:58:59] Heh, played with Burp the other day on my format employers site... didn't find anything interesting and decided to play with my companys website instead..

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[15:08:45] should be in #politics and I shouldn't get upset.. but QAnon is such a joke.. it's as much of a group or organization as Al-Qaeda is/was...

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[15:58:49] JoseAlPaca, the right arm?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[15:59:44] ofc
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[15:59:50] i'm german
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[15:59:59] how do you know which arm I used? :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:03] i know which one is supposed to use!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:00:18] maybe the guy is facing you.. or not..
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:19] o/ <- the right one ofc
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:29] i don't see eyes there - do you?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:00:40] so obviously it's the back of the head
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:01:02] haha, fair enough :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:01:17] \o <- in this case, the eyes are too small. so obviously it's from the front
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:01:52] dafuq.. i have problems with perspiration :o
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:02:02] it is literally dripping from my arms :o
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:02:07] and it's not even warm
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:02:58] jesus fucking christ
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:03:23] i "googled" excessive perspiration (but in swedish) and ended up on our governmental site for health advice
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:03:36] one of the treatments is to use microwaves to destroy the sweat glands o_O
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:04:22] lolwut
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:04:51] as for the reasons:
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:05:34] "you're overweight, drink too much alcohole, have diabetes, manopause, bieffect from medication, social anxiety, some long lasting infection... some kind of cancer...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:05:59] mhm
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+Libre___	[16:06:03] I still sweat a lot, but losing weight has helped with it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:06:04] so, it's either some long lasting infection... or diabetes then
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:06:11] definitely your overwweight and menopause are the reasons
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:06:19] haha, indeed
2021-07-20 11:29:00	 *	zelest [16:06:31] is 180cm tall and weight 65kg
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:06:45] yeah, obv your scale is broken

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[16:08:09] no, but serously, I sweat like a pig, everyday

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:08:24] you'd have a field day with my swedish ex
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:08:52] the sole mention of an infections disease had her panicking
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+Requit	[16:21:23] What about something tame like leprosy
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:30:23] pft
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:30:25] too obvious
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[16:30:42] can't tease someone with having it maybe cause everyone knows

2021-07-20 11:29:00	&Derecho	[17:42:23] so far quite tiring
2021-07-20 11:29:00	&Derecho	[17:42:28] but I'm in a decent mood :)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	chik	[17:42:36] good good
2021-07-20 11:29:00	&Derecho	[17:43:14] it's just that travelling to see family results in a *very* different experience than let's say, going camping in the woods
2021-07-20 11:29:00	&Derecho	[17:43:34] or the beach for that matter
2021-07-20 11:29:00	&kylef	[17:43:45] I was considering the latter there, maybe a good opportunity for vacation without other people being around
2021-07-20 11:29:00	&Derecho	[17:43:57] not really get much chance to relax or even focus on your own objectives
2021-07-20 11:29:00	&Derecho	[17:44:42] kylef: could be good! try not to go to a too popular beach though otherwise you're still surrounded with people, even if they're not necessarily talking to you
2021-07-20 11:29:00	&kylef	[17:46:47] Derecho: i thinking something like middle of nowhere scotland or something like that

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[21:16:01] doubt they'll last longer, though. so maybe i should make myself go shop each time i want them
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[21:16:23] i am loath to admit but they do indeed beat my selfmade ones

2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[21:25:29] grumpy isn't a deadly sin
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[21:25:34] the closest would probably be wrath
2021-07-20 11:29:00	chik	[21:28:36] what dwarf is Digerati ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	 *	JoseAlPaca [21:29:57] votes for happy

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+Requit	[21:36:46] I'm the eigth sin, despondance.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	chik	[21:37:20] being sad is depressed is not a sin Requit

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+Cardinal	[21:37:27] chik meant: being sad and depressed is not a sin Requit
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+Requit	[21:37:38] No but rejecting the beauty of God's creation to wallow in your sadness is.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+Requit	[21:37:42] Or at least, was historically.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+SillyGoose	[21:50:49] How is Requit today?

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[22:42:46] what was so iffy about it?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:44:05] nothing really.. it was just very beta when I tried last time
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:44:16] 'ifconfig wg0 destroy' gave me a panic back then
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:44:24] and I didn't care to continue fiddling :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:44:29] seems to be more mature by now
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+garandil	[22:44:49] its your OS zelest , not wireguard :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:45:27] garandil, it was.. and it was the official wireguard dev that ported that stuff to my OS :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:45:46] also, I tried it in -current, where one expect it to be dragons :)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+garandil	[22:45:58] :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:46:03] my OS loves wireguard
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:46:06] look: https://ifconfig.se/wg.jpg
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:46:13] look how happy they look :)

2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:46:39] that shirt is twice as cool now
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:46:51] they pulled it from the store due to copyright infringement
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+zelest	[22:46:57] but I got mine before it was pulled :D
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nesoi	[22:54:43] hi SillyGoose!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nesoi	[22:54:46] everyone
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[23:08:21] huh
2021-07-20 11:29:00	 *	JoseAlPaca [23:08:35] suddenly comprehends why avidemux just died earlier
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+JoseAlPaca	[23:08:43] ffmpeg was built without nonfree
2021-07-20 11:29:00	 *	JoseAlPaca [23:08:47] grmls
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:13:02] Digerati:  damn dude, i should of listened when i had a chance to get those helium miners or at least get on a waitlist. everyones no longer taking orders cause so many of them are so backed up 
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:13:49] yeah i heard there are like 250k backordered
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:13:52] general estimate
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:16:55] doesnt surprise me, someone told me about them in another channel like 8 months ago and it was already backed up then.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:17:05] i have 8 nebras coming hopefully this month or possibly next month
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:17:27] thats awesome,  at least i get a bit of time to get people on board
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:17:46] as soon as they are available i want to order like 10 
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:18:04] well, a halving is happening on august 1
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:18:13] whats that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:18:14] so all rewards issued will be halved then
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:18:26] generally when that happens with cryptos, the value goes up
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:18:31] not always though
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:18:31] oh that sucks, so ive missed the peak again 
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:32:08] well it has always been known that as more and more hotspots go online, the fewer rewards each will get on average
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:32:33] as there's a fixed amount of HNT mined each epoch
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:40:04] so prob still a great time to get on board
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:40:22] i checked the map and in sydney there is only a few people mining it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:41:15] yeah, the best places to join today are where there are few hotspots
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:42:36] the optimal number of witnesses for hotspots is 4 currently (set by a chain variable so it can be changed, but it has been that for a while, primarily because unlike regular cell towers, hotspots are generally running on residential internet that may not be really reliable, so having 4x coverage is deemed ideal for network reliability and usage at any given location)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:43:51] i was going to get 3 but now im thinking 4
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:44:28] well with minimum 12-20 week lead time, chances are good that hotspots will be popping up around you over the next few months before you receive yours
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:44:41] already know where they are going, one at my mums house then at my fiances mums house and then my grandparents house. they are roughly 5 miles from each other 
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:45:11] might have to get a higher gain antenna and decent elevation for them to see each other
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:45:20] yeah going to be a interested few months, saw the aus one is shipping out october so i guess we will see how many people in sydney are invested in octoboer 
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:45:20] lorawan is mostly a line of sight network
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:45:35] you can see the hotspot statistics here: https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:45:41] the number that have been coming online is crazy
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:45:56] went from 62k to 91k over the past 30 days
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:46:10] yeah i need to do a proper deep dive and learn how all this works, at the moment i have a tldr amount of knownledge 
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:46:59] this is important reading for determining optimal hotspot placement in terms of rewards: https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md
2021-07-20 11:29:00	@zeta	[00:47:00] ‡ HIP/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md at master · helium/HIP · GitHub
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:47:13] it's fairly complex
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:47:44] https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0015-beaconing-rewards.md as well
2021-07-20 11:29:00	@zeta	[00:47:44] ‡ HIP/0015-beaconing-rewards.md at master · helium/HIP · GitHub
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:47:59] those are the two major one discussing how rewards are issued to hotspots
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:50:23] so its a combination of distance and numbers to optimize rewards. 
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:50:45] ive been thinking cause i work with independent petrol stations, would it be that hard to go into each site and install one without them knowing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:51:38] nope, wouldn't be at all, as long as you have a decent way to power it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:51:48] and connect to the internet
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:51:59] some people use mobile hotspots if they're not in range of wifi
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[00:53:13] do they need to constantly be connected to the internet?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:53:27] yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:53:36] well, when it's not, you won't get any rewards
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:54:10] i've read that some people have a solar panel/mobile hotspot setup that doesn't need any kind of physical connectivity at all
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:54:32] that's pretty cool, you could just climb a tree and mount it up there :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	%Digerati	[00:55:23] best way to increase range and # witnesses and rewards is to put the antenna as high as possible, even a 1m height difference has been shown to have a significant effect on range
2021-07-20 11:29:00	+SillyGoose	[00:56:18] you got an equation for that? :P

2021-07-20 11:29:00	nesoi	[02:46:08] yes if they are death cap mushrooms
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vaquero	[02:46:46] first off if your taking  death cap mushrooms then your already doing magic mushrooms wrong
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nesoi	[02:47:20] death is magic

2021-07-20 11:29:00	@narada	[05:44:52] veganix is way cooler

2021-07-20 11:29:00	@narada	[05:46:22] def can't talk to people where i live the way they talk on irc
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nesoi	[05:47:21] maybe from a small town?

2021-07-20 11:29:00	@narada	[05:49:52] awefweg was banned again a day or two ago but i dunno why
2021-07-20 11:29:00	@narada	[05:49:58] no idea
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nesoi	[05:50:28] no comment
2021-07-20 11:29:00	kilroy	[05:50:29] telling nesoi to go fuck himself and die. I think that was the main reason.
