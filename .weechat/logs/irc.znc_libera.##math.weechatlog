2021-07-17 04:19:38	noobly	[18:55:03] does this question have enough info in it? https://imgur.com/a/SMwJL68 - is the +/- value of the 'coefficients' supposed to represent the class?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:46:04] forgive me, I'm a mathematically illiterate luddite
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:48:03] if I smash my face against vocabulary I don't understand for long enough, will I eventually realise how the nabla operator can take my 2d field of scalar values and give me a vector
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:48:33] or should I just give up and go potter about in the garden?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	buster	[19:50:16] Thoams, what seems to be the trouble? :) The two partial derivatives of the scalar field give you the two components of the vector.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:50:56] hi buster :)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:51:17] the trouble starts in your second sentence there - 'partial derivative'
2021-07-17 04:19:38	buster	[19:51:55] They are often made to seem quite mysterious. Are you ok on ordinary derivatives, for functions of one variable?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:53:44] yes but only slightly - I understand that an object moving over a period of time moves, and that we describe that motion using units - m/s-1
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:54:08] but the very word 'derive' means to mean "figure out"
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:54:27] in what sense does that notion apply?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:55:56] I'm a programmer with only a passing notion of mathematics - functions and variables I understand implicitly
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:56:20] and I think I might be missing some lightbulb moment
2021-07-17 04:19:38	taeaad	[19:57:25] johnkeats6: Do you have that link again, I disconnected.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	buster	[19:57:48] You've rather lost me there. Perhaps I should have used the word 'differentiation' instead. In any case, it's really a prerequisite. It might not be a good idea to try to explain any so-called 'multivariable calculus' before you can walk.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	johnkeats6	[19:57:48] https://math.stackexchange.com/a/448573/9921
2021-07-17 04:19:38	buster	[19:58:05] Having said that, if your scalar field is denoted s(x, y), then for any x and y, consider the function f(t) = s(x+t, y). Then the partial derivative (ds/dx) at (x, y) is just (df/dt) at t=0.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:59:21] unwrapping that - I already have a value at x,y - so s(x,y) is just "how you arrive at that value", right?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Z-module	[19:59:37] in other words, merely the instanenous rate of change in the values of f as you traverse the point point (x,y) horizontally to the right along a straight path
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[19:59:43] t being time, x altered by time
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:00:29] ds is delta S - delta the change in my value at my grid reference -
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:00:44] divided by delta x?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:01:05] and I've gone cross-eyed.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:02:03] the difference between x at t0 and x at t1!
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Z-module	[20:02:05] you need to learn about and get relatively comfortable with ordinary derivatives of one-variable functions, before tackling this setting
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:02:53] this has a direct relation to the complexity - which I'm currently avoiding - of moving from 2d to 3d
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:03:07] I must move from 2d to 1d to comprehend it
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:03:09] right?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:03:30] that sort of makes a lot of sense
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:03:32] thank you!
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:03:35] ordinary derivatives
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:03:40] here we come :)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	buster	[20:03:46] have fun!
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:03:51] cheers!
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Z-module	[20:04:09] when you come back to this, it's not a difficult extension of that concept
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Thoams	[20:05:39] I'll get there and probably enjoy the journey. Thanks for your support. Bye for now!
2021-07-17 04:19:38	taeaad	[20:06:57] johnkeats6: Thanks, and sorry for asking twice.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	noobly	[21:03:47] reposting this if there's any ML-heads here: https://imgur.com/a/SMwJL68, i don't really understand how to solve this. I don't know which support vectors belong to which class, or what the coefficients are.

2021-07-17 05:24:16	tusko	[23:17:35] I've done discrete maths twice

2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:18:39] my first-year probability lecturer got a standing ovation at the end of his course
2021-07-17 05:24:16	tusko	[23:18:45] I have Book of Proof, though, so always have a good reference for discrete
2021-07-17 05:24:16	tusko	[23:18:59] That must be rare. I've found probability instructors are almost universally bad
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:19:10] not sure if he was that good or just terribly handsome, but it's the only time i've ever seen that
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:19:52] jk, they were very good lectures. wish i could remember them.
2021-07-17 05:24:16	tusko	[23:20:44] When you say 'closed' what exactly is closed?
2021-07-17 05:24:16	tusko	[23:20:55] The potential function? the solution?
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:22:30] hmm, the DE itself I think, but maybe it doesn't really transfer to DE's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_and_exact_differential_forms
2021-07-17 05:24:16	mawk	[23:24:16] are there special properties to a matrix that's not symmetric but whose eigenvalues are all real and positive?
2021-07-17 05:24:16	tusko	[23:27:11] positive definite
2021-07-17 05:24:16	mawk	[23:27:56] yeah that's synonymous I suppose
2021-07-17 05:24:16	mawk	[23:28:09] but the matrix is not symmetri
2021-07-17 05:24:16	tusko	[23:28:26] Doesn't have to be symmetric to be positive definite (apparently)
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:29:00] yeah but see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_matrix#Extension_for_non-Hermitian_square_matrices
2021-07-17 05:24:16	mawk	[23:29:09] all I can find is about symmetric
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:29:32] the eigenvalues aren't all real and positive. and it's not a very useful idea as far as i know.
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:30:21] (i don't mean your question isn't useful. i mean non-hermitian positive-definite matrices don't come up much.)
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:31:01] mawk, take a basis of eigenvectors.
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:35:00] tusko, it's "M(t,y)dt+N(t,y)dy", a differential form, that's the thing that may (or may not) be closed.
2021-07-17 05:24:16	slycelote	[23:36:04] anovick, sin x varies too wildly to just replace it with 1. Try replacing the other factor (1/x)
2021-07-17 05:24:16	buster	[23:36:05] maybe you could say "M(t,y)+N(t,y)(dy/dt)" is or isn't closed, but i don't know.
2021-07-17 05:24:16	anovick	[23:43:46] slycelote: thank you so much!! I followed your advice and compared f(x) = sinx / x with the function g(x) = sinx / 2pi which was easy enough to integrate, to get the upper bound in the inequality, and then with h(x) = sinx / 3pi to similarly get the lower bound
2021-07-17 05:24:16	tusko	[23:54:04] buster, right, that's a total differential, no?

2021-07-17 05:25:15	anovick	[23:06:05] the best approach I found for this so far was comparing the function f(x) which I want to integrate with another function g(x) that is easier to calculate integral of in this range [2pi, 3pi]. I found g(x) = 1 / x, which satisfies g(x) => f(x) and via a theorem I get integral(g(x)) => integral(f(x)). however the g(x) I found isn't tight enough
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:06:32] buster, so what is the other test?
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:06:37] ugh, how frustrating
2021-07-17 05:25:15	buster	[23:06:56] find the psi in https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Exact.aspx
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:07:13] anovick, [2pi,3pi] is congruent to [0, pi]
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:07:23] or at least those integrals should be the same
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:07:27] idk if that helps
2021-07-17 05:25:15	anovick	[23:07:47] tusko: umm for sinx they are, but not for x
2021-07-17 05:25:15	buster	[23:07:55] tusko, ok, there's poincaré's lemma
2021-07-17 05:25:15	anovick	[23:08:08] I have f(x) = sinx / x
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:08:24] anovick, sorry m8 this might be over my head probably
2021-07-17 05:25:15	buster	[23:08:27] if the domain is 'nice' then closed implies exact.
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:08:59] buster, ok this might make sense then.
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:09:27] So checking the cross-partials says 'this might be exact' and successfully finding the potential function says 'yup. exact.'?
2021-07-17 05:25:15	buster	[23:10:54] yeah, or at least finding out somehow that the potential function is out there somewhere
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:11:14] anovick, just guessing here really, but what about if you did like a Taylor series on the integral to estimate it and showed -that- is bounded by 2pi/3 and 1/pi?
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:12:37] buster, so like if both partial derivatives were continuous everywhere? Wouldn't that imply uniqueness?
2021-07-17 05:25:15	anovick	[23:13:08] tusko: umm Taylor series estimation is an advanced technique I haven't learned yet
2021-07-17 05:25:15	buster	[23:13:17] tusko, that turns out to be a question in topology, with big implications for physics
2021-07-17 05:25:15	buster	[23:13:47] one works out what that word 'nice' I used above means
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:14:06] I'm not smart enough for topology
2021-07-17 05:25:15	buster	[23:14:41] me neither, but it's interesting stuff. it's called de Rham cohomology.
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:14:56] Honestly now that I'm at ODEs idk what to do next. It seems like my real options are like number theory, real analysis, numerical analysis, or abstract algebra
2021-07-17 05:25:15	buster	[23:15:20] yep all of those. and topology.
2021-07-17 05:25:15	tusko	[23:15:27] of those maybe only number theory or numerical analysis do I think I stand a chance at understanding

2021-07-17 05:35:54	anovick	[23:06:05] the best approach I found for this so far was comparing the function f(x) which I want to integrate with another function g(x) that is easier to calculate integral of in this range [2pi, 3pi]. I found g(x) = 1 / x, which satisfies g(x) => f(x) and via a theorem I get integral(g(x)) => integral(f(x)). however the g(x) I found isn't tight enough
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:06:32] buster, so what is the other test?
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:06:37] ugh, how frustrating
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:06:56] find the psi in https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Exact.aspx
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:07:13] anovick, [2pi,3pi] is congruent to [0, pi]
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:07:23] or at least those integrals should be the same
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:07:27] idk if that helps
2021-07-17 05:35:54	anovick	[23:07:47] tusko: umm for sinx they are, but not for x
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:07:55] tusko, ok, there's poincaré's lemma
2021-07-17 05:35:54	anovick	[23:08:08] I have f(x) = sinx / x
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:08:24] anovick, sorry m8 this might be over my head probably
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:08:27] if the domain is 'nice' then closed implies exact.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:08:59] buster, ok this might make sense then.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:09:27] So checking the cross-partials says 'this might be exact' and successfully finding the potential function says 'yup. exact.'?
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:10:54] yeah, or at least finding out somehow that the potential function is out there somewhere
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:11:14] anovick, just guessing here really, but what about if you did like a Taylor series on the integral to estimate it and showed -that- is bounded by 2pi/3 and 1/pi?
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:12:37] buster, so like if both partial derivatives were continuous everywhere? Wouldn't that imply uniqueness?
2021-07-17 05:35:54	anovick	[23:13:08] tusko: umm Taylor series estimation is an advanced technique I haven't learned yet
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:13:17] tusko, that turns out to be a question in topology, with big implications for physics
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:13:47] one works out what that word 'nice' I used above means
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:14:06] I'm not smart enough for topology
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:14:41] me neither, but it's interesting stuff. it's called de Rham cohomology.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:14:56] Honestly now that I'm at ODEs idk what to do next. It seems like my real options are like number theory, real analysis, numerical analysis, or abstract algebra
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:15:20] yep all of those. and topology.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:15:27] of those maybe only number theory or numerical analysis do I think I stand a chance at understanding
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:16:01] I have really begun to enjoy math, though
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:17:12] ooh ooh ooh discrete maths and probability too
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:17:35] I've done discrete maths twice
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:17:56] both times the prof was kinda shit, but at least the second time he mentioned relations and equivalence classes
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:18:39] my first-year probability lecturer got a standing ovation at the end of his course
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:18:45] I have Book of Proof, though, so always have a good reference for discrete
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:18:59] That must be rare. I've found probability instructors are almost universally bad
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:19:10] not sure if he was that good or just terribly handsome, but it's the only time i've ever seen that
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:19:52] jk, they were very good lectures. wish i could remember them.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:20:44] When you say 'closed' what exactly is closed?
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:20:55] The potential function? the solution?
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:22:30] hmm, the DE itself I think, but maybe it doesn't really transfer to DE's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_and_exact_differential_forms
2021-07-17 05:35:54	mawk	[23:24:16] are there special properties to a matrix that's not symmetric but whose eigenvalues are all real and positive?
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:27:11] positive definite
2021-07-17 05:35:54	mawk	[23:27:56] yeah that's synonymous I suppose
2021-07-17 05:35:54	mawk	[23:28:09] but the matrix is not symmetri
2021-07-17 05:35:54	tusko	[23:28:26] Doesn't have to be symmetric to be positive definite (apparently)
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:29:00] yeah but see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_matrix#Extension_for_non-Hermitian_square_matrices
2021-07-17 05:35:54	mawk	[23:29:09] all I can find is about symmetric
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:29:32] the eigenvalues aren't all real and positive. and it's not a very useful idea as far as i know.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:30:21] (i don't mean your question isn't useful. i mean non-hermitian positive-definite matrices don't come up much.)
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:31:01] mawk, take a basis of eigenvectors.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:35:00] tusko, it's "M(t,y)dt+N(t,y)dy", a differential form, that's the thing that may (or may not) be closed.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	slycelote	[23:36:04] anovick, sin x varies too wildly to just replace it with 1. Try replacing the other factor (1/x)
2021-07-17 05:35:54	buster	[23:36:05] maybe you could say "M(t,y)+N(t,y)(dy/dt)" is or isn't closed, but i don't know.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	anovick	[23:43:46] slycelote: thank you so much!! I followed your advice and compared f(x) = sinx / x with the function g(x) = sinx / 2pi which was easy enough to integrate, to get the upper bound in the inequality, and then with h(x) = sinx / 3pi to similarly get the lower bound

2021-07-17 15:00:01	buster	[00:15:15] tusko, uh, i think it is the total differential of some function from R^2 to R if and only if it's exact, but don't quote me
2021-07-17 15:00:01	buster	[00:17:11] total differential is a linear transformation. so you need to see the differential form as a linear transformation too for that to make sense. and it turns out you can do that.
2021-07-17 15:00:01	buster	[00:21:38] if you want to sort out what the vector spaces are there, don't ask me, because i won't explain it well. but a good book that talks about differential geometry will.
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:32:32] How come modern math doesn't have the ability to deal well with things like infinite recursion, higher order operators (like power towers etc), generic types, or more subtle aspects of human reasoning?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:33:29] why does it break down when you go beyond the simplest case like multiplication or exponentiation
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:33:59] or try to define infinite recursion beyond the simple induction case
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:34:39] Whats generic types?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:35:07] david_hilbert: example my point
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:35:37] you can't deal with real world problems without that concept even programming has the concept and its considered fundamental and trivial
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:35:42] but math has no such concept
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:35:55] everything has one type not parametized types (as one example)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:36:03] they're simple objects
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:36:08] Mathematics has something like types in algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:37:04] david_hilbert: but algebra example groups and rings only consider multiplication right?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:37:13] not true higher order operators
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:37:19] it only goes up to n = 2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:37:30] "polynomials" usually
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:37:53] there's infinitely more complex algebraic structures you can form or build up
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:38:06] and they don't simplify to the 2 dimensional case
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:38:23] (in terms of type, not dimension in the mathematical algebraic sense)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:38:48] in fact,math has the inability to express such types
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:39:10] even to define them, using naive concepts like 'function' or 'functor'
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:39:20] they lack the proper expressiveness
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:39:36] that even other formal languages have for their most primitive expressions
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:41:22] tell me something about the properties of 2^2 ^2 * x^x^x^x + 6 ^ 6 ^ 6 *  x^x^x + 2 uparrow 5
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:42:01] or the generic "type" f(T) where f(x) represents that expression and T is any algebraic type
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:42:39] you've only studied such expressions for "trivial" polynomials by forcing definition of a polynomial to have order 2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:42:47] dimension 2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:42:56] no other 'high order' functions allowed or complex types of any sort
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:43:01] What? Multivariate polynomials are certainly studied
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:43:22] david_hilbert: yes ... but a "polynomial" in the sense you're using it only uses addition and multiplication by definition
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:43:29] there are infinitely many higher order operators
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:43:43] beyond multiplication
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:43:49] What kinds of operators?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:43:57] thus you can form infinitely many more nontrivial examples of 'algebraic structure' in the real world
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:44:07] that math cannot express well
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:44:21] Most "operators" I know are something like integral with so and so kernel
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:44:54] david_hilbert: here is hyper-4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:45:11] And whats the significance/real life usage that has been found for that?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:45:21] you could easily form 'rings' or 'groups' with hyper-n operators as a trivial case
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:45:25] The operators that have been found to be fruitful in real life have been studied a lot
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:45:29] such as the fourier transform
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:45:29] but theyre not studied at all
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:45:57] david_hilbert: lol ... so youre trying to turn it back on me?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:46:20] Math people study all kinds of operators all the time
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:46:32] david_hilbert: no, you rarely if ever see anything beyond exponentiation
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:46:35] Its as I said often something integral with something kernel
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:46:41] evne in modern algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:46:45] and beyond
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:47:07] david_hilbert: no matrix multiplication has same order as regular multiplication
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:47:14] kernel in fourier transform is something like e^(-2pti)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:47:15] its not about the things youre multiplying
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:47:21] for example
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:47:29] People research all kinds of operators all the time
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:47:34] There are millions of operators out there
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:47:47] as many operators as there are choices of kernel
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:47:52] david_hilbert: matrix multiplicatiopn suffers from sample problem im talking about
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:48:02] and "operators" usually mean kernel blah blah blah some matrix or linear operator
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:48:21] That covers a quite broad territory
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:48:25] try defining matrix tetration
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:48:32] and solve tetration equations in matricies
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:48:36] What will you do with tetrating soemthing?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:48:42] Already I rarely see expressions like x^x
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:48:45] and let the type of the matrix vary (not just real numbers) but any generic algebraic type
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:48:49] why would x^x^x be common
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:48:49] then youd have 1 triival example of what im talking about
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:49:14] i assure you linear or even "operator"  algebra is not sufficient
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:49:32] david_hilbert: because thats recursion lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:49:39] are you asking me why recursion is common in the real world?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:49:45] thats simple example of recursion but one that stops
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:49:52] its what im trying to get at
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:51:28] It is, but like recursion is moot
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:51:47] Most "recursions" are just trivial definitions of say constant coefficient difference series
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:51:47] etc
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:51:56] ie trivially iterative shit
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:52:31] cool whats the trivial definition of the constant coefficient difference series for x^x^x^x ?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:53:15] im not talking about recurrence relations or linear recurrence lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:53:20] whats the real life scenario you saw it
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:53:23] I barely even see x^x
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:53:26] that furthers my point that in math recurssion is trivial
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:53:30] let alone 4 tet x
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:53:37] and thus maths doesnt really touch on anything complex most of the time because of this fault
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:54:12] david_hilbert: real life scenario for general recurssion? uh let me see
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:54:15] fibonocci numbers?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:54:19] would be a trivial example lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:54:29] Which as I said is a trivial second order difference equation
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:54:29] the linear relations you were talking about before
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:54:39] trivial iterative form
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:54:48] your definition of second order and mine are completely different
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:54:51] mines functional in definition
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:54:55] yours is arbitrary
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:55:00] thats how difference equations are defined
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:55:02] a subset of mine
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:55:05] their order is the number of past terms they depend on
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:55:21] david_hilbert: iteratitive solutions can be written as recursive solutions
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:55:26] thats maths 101
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:55:37] so i dont get your point? in fact, its wrong
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:55:52] recursion is more powerful
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:55:57] iteration requires countable sets
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:56:10] and a successor function
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:56:19] its why maths avoids the concept or tries to
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:56:47] its why it tries to define the 'order' or 'dimension' of something independent of the operator lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:57:06] cause its scared of the powerful construct
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:57:32] *more powerful*
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:58:18] induction is the most powerful tool in maths to deal with recursion currently
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:58:37] and computer science avoids recursion too except when its easily proven to terminate in a bounded (even more strict than finite) steps
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:58:38] but theres no tools to deal with general recursion
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:59:29] Theres no tools to deal with general graphs either and thats what general recursion is: a general tree/dag
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[01:59:38] im just saying, dont tell me a dude deserves the fields medal when he avoids the elephant in the room
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:59:49] Mathematicians are smart people
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[01:59:52] Programmers are also smart people
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:00:37] david_hilbert: no, theres many tools in programming to deal with general recurssion its far more sophisticated than maths
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:00:46] How so?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:00:47] at this particular thing
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:01:08] in fact its pretty much gonna take the place of maths one day soon i think
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:01:10] Tell me how you prove some general, programmatically generated graph to be bounded etc
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:01:17] its becoming more and more abstract and functional
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:02:00] only room for one star in STEM
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:02:08] Bullshit
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:02:11] david_hilbert: why do you keep reverting back to graph theory
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:02:14] Mathematics and programming serve different goals
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:02:15] david_hilbert: please don't feed the troll
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:02:18] you think thats only way to deal with general recursion lol?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:02:22] johndoe_, because a graph is what a recursion is
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:03:07] LISP people who read that lambda book can float in the clouds all day, its the people who understand the reality of registers, buses and cpus who get shit done
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:03:31] And therein programming is a very different field from math
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:03:38] Programming is the control of digital hardware
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:03:41] Mathematics is other things
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:03:58] Mathematics for example isn't bounded, even when "merely" finite...let alone infinite
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:04:05] Programs always are bounded
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:04:36] the problem is the only modern mathematical abstraction for recursion is a graph currently (besides induction). thats a discrete structure
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:04:40] again requires countable sets lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:04:44] theres no functional definition
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:04:50] And what magical stuff does CS have?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:04:53] that avoids these problems
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:04:55] even though maths invented set theory and likes to think of itself as built on functions
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:05:04] it cant handle the most powerful functions
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:05:13] so it comes up with discrete graphs
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:05:25] pathetic imo
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:05:32] Turing himself stated computer functions are sometimes so complex, you can't even prove they finish and return a result
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:05:44] yep
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:05:49] and yet every math problem has a solution lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:05:53] it seems
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:05:59] you maths ppl are so smart!
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:06:10] So whats the point in using such dangerous tools in the manner of "proofs"?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:06:18] we can't even ensure it will temrinate in the general case
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:06:22] also you think mathematics isnt bounded?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:06:27] It isn't
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:06:27] it most certainly is
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:06:35] Even something with a "finite" set of steps is unbounded
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:06:44] 10 is finite, 10^100 is ,10 ^100^100 is finite
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:06:51] proofs are bounded no?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:06:56] programs arent
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:07:02] Boundedness is a far stricter criterion than just finiteness
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:07:02] they can have infinite loops even trivial ones
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:07:06] theres no infinite proof lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:07:25] Bounds such as max so and so steps, and so and so memory cells are what programming needs
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:07:33] Which mathematics often doesen't bother with
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:07:59] it "needs" that stuff to deal with general recursion lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:08:02] and non trivial problems
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:08:11] and math not bothering with "that stuff" is whole reason why its trivial beyond calculus
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:08:26] or at least not used beyond theoretical physics
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:08:40] you dudes cant deal with recursion well
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:08:41] and wont admit it
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:08:57] or that the solution is a turing machine or something equivalent
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:09:14] Turing machines are by definition not tractable in the general case
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:09:21] So I fail to see how they can be useful tools for thought
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:09:33] well not by definition, but the point still holds
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:09:37] and that's precisely why theyre so expression and efficient at dealing with real world problems and non trivial problems in general
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:09:42] its a trade-off
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:09:54] johndoe_: primitive recursive functions is a mathematical construct
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:09:57] usefulness and expressiveness vs strict formal rigour to describe trivial nonsense problems
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:09:57] The computer based mathematical proofs have had lots of advancements but its really wrong to claim somehow programming and math can tackle the same kinds of problems
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:10:06] Programming is the control of digital hardware first and foremost
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:10:12] and was a model of computation before turing finalized his notion of turing machine
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:10:38] turing machines is a mthematical construct too
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:11:08] you should also look up universal algebras
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:11:17] Programming isn't head in the clouds philosophical thinking
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:11:31] its the dirty, ugly business of dealing with networks, buses, interrupts, locks etc
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:11:35] Fangs: you should look up recursion
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:12:01] another one for the ignore list, it seems
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:12:17] anything built on FIRST -ORDER logic is first order
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:12:24] including universal algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:12:29] Fangs: yep welcome to my ignore list
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:13:04] epsilon -deltas are a first-order way to deal with recursion as well but
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:13:18] its still highly bounded
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:13:19] I think I read first order logic is equivalent to turing machines
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:13:25] Turing machines are no more powerful
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:14:24] or no less powerful at that
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:14:27] I can solve general recursive programming problems without issue. If I were to try and express that as a mathematical concept I'd fall short
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:14:27] They are equivalent
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:14:30] its simple as that
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:14:32] really
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:14:43] turing machines have nothing to do with it
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:14:55] they are a mathematical object themselves
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:15:04] so of course they fall short as well
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:15:21] programming on other hand can deal with general recursion because it makes certain tradeoffs in terms of rigour and formality
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:15:25] that it gains in expressiveness
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:15:37] Whatever computer science you have in your head is also a mathematics, an abstract kind because it doesn't exist in real life
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:15:44] real life is finite and bounded
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:16:19] and mathematics belongs to logic and logic belongs to philosophy
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:16:20] so what
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:16:42] None of that is equivalent ot real life programming
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:16:54] come up with an abstract machine that can deal with state and general recursion and youll have my respect
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:16:55] Real life programming is finite and bounded, heavily so, in time and space
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:17:35] mathematical objects should be able to change state
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:17:37] in formal ways
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:17:52] during course of the proof
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:18:39] instead, it uses round about ways to encode it in ridiculously complex and unnecessary abstractions
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:19:15] I agree that state change is useful and important and the FP philosophers face problems because of trying to avoid it
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:19:15] example is weierstrass function
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:19:35] the fact that that is an object of study means theres a problem and its only 'best way' to encode state
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:19:38] in proofs
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:20:51] polynomials could probably be eliminated if there were a trivial concept of a 'loop'
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:20:58] a finite sequence of steps that was easily expressable
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:21:17] as [n, x, lower order function]
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:21:25] I agree strongly with you that in the programming context the "pure FP" types are heavily misguided
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:21:28] Definitely agree++
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:22:11] no I mean in math not programming
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:22:15] proofs lack basic abstractions
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:22:18] that a 5 year old knows
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:22:39] they lack even the most trivial concept of state or control structures beyond if statements
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:22:57] thats why maths is so complex but only solves trivial problems or complex useless problem
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:23:10] you could literally eliminate modern algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:23:22] by making a basic finite loop standard syntax in a formal proof
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:23:50] we already have the summation symbol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:24:05] of course its not a general loop
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:25:45] imagine what you could do with a simple, general loop
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[02:26:03] johndoe_: i have to disagree with "you could literally eliminate modern algebra", or at least, ask for more evidence that there is a decent alternative
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[02:26:44] because modern algebra seems to be quite essential for many results even outside of algebra itself, such as number theory
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:28:16] dude12312414: thats not an essential dependency its contrived
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:28:47] I mean, imagine if you could program using general abstractions and compose them like in a loop
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:29:06] 100 page proofs would ge reduced to succint 1 page proofs
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:29:13] itd eliminate a lot of garbage
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:29:17] patterns would start to emerge
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:29:25] standard libraries of proofs would be formed
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:29:34] that you could import into your own proof as pure abstraction
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:29:35] But the very point of general programs is that they are, per turing, intractable
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:29:41] YOu cannot say anything about its output
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:29:44] or even if it will finish
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:29:49] thats the grand lie
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:29:54] you dont need to
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:30:03] The restrictions of mathematical proofs are what lets them well be proofs
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:30:05] sure, theres limits to logical positivism
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:30:13] not all truths are mathematical
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:30:25] but surely you can have a single finite and formally defined loop
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:30:34] the concept is well defined and well applied
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:30:48] the very idea you cant have a loop in proofs is insane
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:31:02] its logically sound, think about it
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:31:38] its time to advance Principia Mathematica
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:31:42] to add in loops
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:31:57] a WHILE loop
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:31:59] not a fucking for loop
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:32:01] not a discrete loop
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:32:08] a simple WHILE loop to deal with recursion
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:32:21] and youll prove Riemann hypothesis and P=NP
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:32:25] but while and for have equal power
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:32:39] thats another lie
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:32:47] for is discrete
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:32:51] requies a counter
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:32:53] I can exactly transform a for into a while
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:32:55] and vice versa
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:33:19] everything has a counter
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:33:23] the cpu has a program counter register
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:33:28] good luck trying to formalize a for in a way thats acceptable
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:33:37] a while is easy
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:33:43] why go discrete?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:33:49] how would you deal with for x in R?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	loopspace	[02:33:52] Why so cranky?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:33:59] R is a subtle issue
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:34:32] and arguably we already do x over R when it makes sense when we are doing an integration
2021-07-17 15:00:01	david_hilbert	[02:35:07] Mathematicians are a smart bunch. And so are computer science people.
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:35:10] oh yea, the 'limit'
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:35:16] cool concept
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:35:20] avoids a loop
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:35:38] loopspace: any interesting problem?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:35:42] anything is better than this
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:36:03] david_hilbert: no set theory does x in R thats it
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:36:09] for x in R? lol no
2021-07-17 15:00:01	loopspace	[02:36:28] Fangs: maybe when I get to the end of this current section of the book
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:36:37] in / if statements, variables. you dudes are operating at 1% capacity
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:36:49] loopspace: im not cranky ? lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:37:04] im glad people are finally acknowledging this
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:37:10] ive been saying it for over 10 years
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:37:28] I have papers on it
2021-07-17 15:00:01	loopspace	[02:37:33] Fangs: here's a preview  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mYcY8Q51/exercises.png
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:37:49] loopspace: since you mentioned group rings yesterday, something crossed my mind. group rings are hopf algebras, note ZG -> ZG (x) ZG (tensored over Z) with g -> g(x)1 + 1(x)g
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:38:04] wonder if you'd know anything about holf algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[02:38:41] 9.12 I didn't realize they were adjoint pairs
2021-07-17 15:00:01	loopspace	[02:38:54] Fangs: watching a movie rn but may get to those tonight. Afk for a bit. Will also read your posts a bit later
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:42:21] *yawn* holf algebras
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:42:22] bbl
2021-07-17 15:00:01	johndoe_	[02:42:47] maybe when someone of my caliber comes back
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[04:38:27] Hi. I'd like to solve tanh(x)/x=y in terms of x, is this possible?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:39:27] cokernel_hacker: I'm not sure what there is to solve there
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:39:29] depends in what way
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:39:34] y in terms of x is just as given
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:39:39] numerically you can compute x up to arbitrary precision
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:39:56] ah, given y, solve x
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:40:02] analytically there is no elementary function whose inverse is tanh(x)/x
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[04:40:06] yes, exactly
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[04:40:12] ok, so I need to solve it numerically
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:40:17] but you could probably do something with Lambert-W functions or something
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:42:10] (this is unrelated, but isn't what cokernel_hacker want is to solve the equation in terms of y?)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:43:04] well that's trivial
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:13] I want x s.t. tanh(x)/x=1/2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:42] there are two solutions which are approximately -1.91501 and 1.91501
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:43:58] I've forgotten most math terms. I thought what's trivial is to solve y in terms of x
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:44:05] (you just plug in x into tanh(x) and divide it by x)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[04:44:07] I wanted an analytical solution :)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:44:32] Fangs: oh sorry yeah i misunderstood
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[04:46:24] sorry if I am not understanding, is there an easy solution to my query?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:48:32] numerically you can use the Newton-Raphson algorithm, which should be pretty straightforward
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:49:08] but if you want a closed form expression for x in terms of y, you're out of luck i think. at least WA can't find an elementary inverse
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:49:25] if you're willing to use 'special functions
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:49:54] e(x) - e(-x)/(e(x) + e(-x))= x/2  ---> 2[e(2x) - 1] = x[e(2x) +1] --> 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:50:06] *'special functions' then you may or may not be able to get a formula, depending on which special functions you accept
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:51:49] supposing x > 0, 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2 -> 2e(2x) - e(log(x)) e(2x) - e(log(x)) = 2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:52:23] I don't think there's a way to factor out the x's so you can just take the log of both sides can you?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	TOB_CyxoB	[04:53:20] cokernel_hacker, just plugged it in into maxima: x=log(-sqrt(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))) ; x=log(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))/2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:53:25] as a rule of thumb, things that mix exponentials with polynomials of x won't have elementary inverses unless there's some "obvious" simplification
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:53:35] i don't have a proof of this
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:53:44] but it usually ends up being the case
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:54:01] that's believable, and I didn't think you'd be able to solve it. I just wanted to try anyway and see where the difficulty is
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:54:15] (*I didn't think I'd be able to solve it, more precisely)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[04:55:34] TOB_CyxoB: that looked promising but using y=1/2 seems to give me something different from the numerical solution
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:57:00] i think they solved for tanh(x) = y
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:57:18] since I'm bored, can we do calculus for this?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:57:36] so we're basically solving for the difference between two functions tanh(x) - 2x = 0
2021-07-17 15:00:01	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:17] cokernel_hacker, x=0.54931 (exp(x*2)-1)/(exp(x*2)+1)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[04:58:17] we want to minimize this, naively, but 0 might not be minimum.. so idk.. (tanh(x) - 2x)^2 insead
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[04:58:20] with calculus you could prove things like "there are exactly n solutions for y in some subset"
2021-07-17 15:00:01	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:46] cokernel_hacker, seems to produce 1/2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	TOB_CyxoB	[04:59:46] cokernel_hacker, the other one is comples as in: 0.54931 + 3.14159i
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:00] TOB_CyxoB: d'oh
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:09] indeed, tanh(log(-.5/(.5-1)-1/(.5-1))/2) is 1/2
2021-07-17 15:00:01	TOB_CyxoB	[05:00:51] *complex
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[05:00:52] 2 (-2 + sech^2(x)) (-2 x + tanh(x)) = 0
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[05:01:00] dude12312414: this is so much less tracable
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[05:01:02] was the original question to solve tanh(x)/x = y or tanh(x) = y?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[05:01:03] its cursed
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cokernel_hacker	[05:01:10] tanh(x)/x = y
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[05:01:18] ok
2021-07-17 15:00:01	TOB_CyxoB	[05:01:50] Oh... sorry
2021-07-17 15:00:01	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:36] dear maxima managed to reduce it to x=(%e^(2*x)-1)/(%e^(2*x)*y+y)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:57] I guess than Newton comes in...
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[05:03:49] actually nvm.. -2 + sech^2(x) is never zero.. so that equation is only zero when (-2 x + tanh(x)) , which is the original problem..
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[05:10:47] uh
2021-07-17 15:00:01	dude12312414	[05:11:08] oh yeah nevermind
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[07:25:51] buster: you're a math physics-leaning guy right?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[07:26:04] buster: how much connection are there between discrete mathematics and math physics?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[07:52:07] I am a theoretical physicist, my favorite phys/math/CS area is enumerative combinatorics, and I am not ready to give a definite answer
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[07:52:31] I guess I'll join the group waiting for buster's answer
2021-07-17 15:00:01	riv	[07:53:04] which area of physics?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[07:53:46] Statistical physics / condensed matter
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[07:56:31] We have Rogers-Ramanujan identities in stat.phys. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[07:58:16] cherim_: do you know anything about operation research?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[07:58:41] if you're in charge of a maths dept, would you rather tack the discrete math folks with the math physics people? or the operation research people?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-17 15:00:01	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-17 15:00:01	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are

2021-07-17 15:00:41	anovick	[23:06:05] the best approach I found for this so far was comparing the function f(x) which I want to integrate with another function g(x) that is easier to calculate integral of in this range [2pi, 3pi]. I found g(x) = 1 / x, which satisfies g(x) => f(x) and via a theorem I get integral(g(x)) => integral(f(x)). however the g(x) I found isn't tight enough
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:06:32] buster, so what is the other test?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:06:37] ugh, how frustrating
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:06:56] find the psi in https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Exact.aspx
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:07:13] anovick, [2pi,3pi] is congruent to [0, pi]
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:07:23] or at least those integrals should be the same
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:07:27] idk if that helps
2021-07-17 15:00:41	anovick	[23:07:47] tusko: umm for sinx they are, but not for x
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:07:55] tusko, ok, there's poincaré's lemma
2021-07-17 15:00:41	anovick	[23:08:08] I have f(x) = sinx / x
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:08:24] anovick, sorry m8 this might be over my head probably
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:08:27] if the domain is 'nice' then closed implies exact.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:08:59] buster, ok this might make sense then.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:09:27] So checking the cross-partials says 'this might be exact' and successfully finding the potential function says 'yup. exact.'?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:10:54] yeah, or at least finding out somehow that the potential function is out there somewhere
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:11:14] anovick, just guessing here really, but what about if you did like a Taylor series on the integral to estimate it and showed -that- is bounded by 2pi/3 and 1/pi?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:12:37] buster, so like if both partial derivatives were continuous everywhere? Wouldn't that imply uniqueness?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	anovick	[23:13:08] tusko: umm Taylor series estimation is an advanced technique I haven't learned yet
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:13:17] tusko, that turns out to be a question in topology, with big implications for physics
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:13:47] one works out what that word 'nice' I used above means
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:14:06] I'm not smart enough for topology
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:14:41] me neither, but it's interesting stuff. it's called de Rham cohomology.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:14:56] Honestly now that I'm at ODEs idk what to do next. It seems like my real options are like number theory, real analysis, numerical analysis, or abstract algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:15:20] yep all of those. and topology.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:15:27] of those maybe only number theory or numerical analysis do I think I stand a chance at understanding
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:16:01] I have really begun to enjoy math, though
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:17:12] ooh ooh ooh discrete maths and probability too
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:17:35] I've done discrete maths twice
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:17:56] both times the prof was kinda shit, but at least the second time he mentioned relations and equivalence classes
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:18:39] my first-year probability lecturer got a standing ovation at the end of his course
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:18:45] I have Book of Proof, though, so always have a good reference for discrete
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:18:59] That must be rare. I've found probability instructors are almost universally bad
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:19:10] not sure if he was that good or just terribly handsome, but it's the only time i've ever seen that
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:19:52] jk, they were very good lectures. wish i could remember them.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:20:44] When you say 'closed' what exactly is closed?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:20:55] The potential function? the solution?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:22:30] hmm, the DE itself I think, but maybe it doesn't really transfer to DE's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_and_exact_differential_forms
2021-07-17 15:00:41	mawk	[23:24:16] are there special properties to a matrix that's not symmetric but whose eigenvalues are all real and positive?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:27:11] positive definite
2021-07-17 15:00:41	mawk	[23:27:56] yeah that's synonymous I suppose
2021-07-17 15:00:41	mawk	[23:28:09] but the matrix is not symmetri
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:28:26] Doesn't have to be symmetric to be positive definite (apparently)
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:29:00] yeah but see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_matrix#Extension_for_non-Hermitian_square_matrices
2021-07-17 15:00:41	mawk	[23:29:09] all I can find is about symmetric
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:29:32] the eigenvalues aren't all real and positive. and it's not a very useful idea as far as i know.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:30:21] (i don't mean your question isn't useful. i mean non-hermitian positive-definite matrices don't come up much.)
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:31:01] mawk, take a basis of eigenvectors.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:35:00] tusko, it's "M(t,y)dt+N(t,y)dy", a differential form, that's the thing that may (or may not) be closed.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	slycelote	[23:36:04] anovick, sin x varies too wildly to just replace it with 1. Try replacing the other factor (1/x)
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[23:36:05] maybe you could say "M(t,y)+N(t,y)(dy/dt)" is or isn't closed, but i don't know.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	anovick	[23:43:46] slycelote: thank you so much!! I followed your advice and compared f(x) = sinx / x with the function g(x) = sinx / 2pi which was easy enough to integrate, to get the upper bound in the inequality, and then with h(x) = sinx / 3pi to similarly get the lower bound
2021-07-17 15:00:41	tusko	[23:54:04] buster, right, that's a total differential, no?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[00:15:15] tusko, uh, i think it is the total differential of some function from R^2 to R if and only if it's exact, but don't quote me
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[00:17:11] total differential is a linear transformation. so you need to see the differential form as a linear transformation too for that to make sense. and it turns out you can do that.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	buster	[00:21:38] if you want to sort out what the vector spaces are there, don't ask me, because i won't explain it well. but a good book that talks about differential geometry will.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:32:32] How come modern math doesn't have the ability to deal well with things like infinite recursion, higher order operators (like power towers etc), generic types, or more subtle aspects of human reasoning?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:33:29] why does it break down when you go beyond the simplest case like multiplication or exponentiation
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:33:59] or try to define infinite recursion beyond the simple induction case
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:34:39] Whats generic types?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:35:07] david_hilbert: example my point
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:35:37] you can't deal with real world problems without that concept even programming has the concept and its considered fundamental and trivial
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:35:42] but math has no such concept
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:35:55] everything has one type not parametized types (as one example)
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:36:03] they're simple objects
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:36:08] Mathematics has something like types in algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:37:04] david_hilbert: but algebra example groups and rings only consider multiplication right?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:37:13] not true higher order operators
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:37:19] it only goes up to n = 2
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:37:30] "polynomials" usually
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:37:53] there's infinitely more complex algebraic structures you can form or build up
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:38:06] and they don't simplify to the 2 dimensional case
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:38:23] (in terms of type, not dimension in the mathematical algebraic sense)
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:38:48] in fact,math has the inability to express such types
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:39:10] even to define them, using naive concepts like 'function' or 'functor'
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:39:20] they lack the proper expressiveness
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:39:36] that even other formal languages have for their most primitive expressions
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:41:22] tell me something about the properties of 2^2 ^2 * x^x^x^x + 6 ^ 6 ^ 6 *  x^x^x + 2 uparrow 5
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:42:01] or the generic "type" f(T) where f(x) represents that expression and T is any algebraic type
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:42:39] you've only studied such expressions for "trivial" polynomials by forcing definition of a polynomial to have order 2
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:42:47] dimension 2
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:42:56] no other 'high order' functions allowed or complex types of any sort
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:43:01] What? Multivariate polynomials are certainly studied
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:43:22] david_hilbert: yes ... but a "polynomial" in the sense you're using it only uses addition and multiplication by definition
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:43:29] there are infinitely many higher order operators
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:43:43] beyond multiplication
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:43:49] What kinds of operators?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:43:57] thus you can form infinitely many more nontrivial examples of 'algebraic structure' in the real world
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:44:07] that math cannot express well
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:44:21] Most "operators" I know are something like integral with so and so kernel
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:44:54] david_hilbert: here is hyper-4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:45:11] And whats the significance/real life usage that has been found for that?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:45:21] you could easily form 'rings' or 'groups' with hyper-n operators as a trivial case
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:45:25] The operators that have been found to be fruitful in real life have been studied a lot
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:45:29] such as the fourier transform
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:45:29] but theyre not studied at all
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:45:57] david_hilbert: lol ... so youre trying to turn it back on me?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:46:20] Math people study all kinds of operators all the time
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:46:32] david_hilbert: no, you rarely if ever see anything beyond exponentiation
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:46:35] Its as I said often something integral with something kernel
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:46:41] evne in modern algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:46:45] and beyond
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:47:07] david_hilbert: no matrix multiplication has same order as regular multiplication
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:47:14] kernel in fourier transform is something like e^(-2pti)
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:47:15] its not about the things youre multiplying
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:47:21] for example
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:47:29] People research all kinds of operators all the time
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:47:34] There are millions of operators out there
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:47:47] as many operators as there are choices of kernel
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:47:52] david_hilbert: matrix multiplicatiopn suffers from sample problem im talking about
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:48:02] and "operators" usually mean kernel blah blah blah some matrix or linear operator
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:48:21] That covers a quite broad territory
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:48:25] try defining matrix tetration
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:48:32] and solve tetration equations in matricies
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:48:36] What will you do with tetrating soemthing?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:48:42] Already I rarely see expressions like x^x
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:48:45] and let the type of the matrix vary (not just real numbers) but any generic algebraic type
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:48:49] why would x^x^x be common
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:48:49] then youd have 1 triival example of what im talking about
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:49:14] i assure you linear or even "operator"  algebra is not sufficient
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:49:32] david_hilbert: because thats recursion lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:49:39] are you asking me why recursion is common in the real world?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:49:45] thats simple example of recursion but one that stops
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:49:52] its what im trying to get at
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:51:28] It is, but like recursion is moot
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:51:47] Most "recursions" are just trivial definitions of say constant coefficient difference series
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:51:47] etc
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:51:56] ie trivially iterative shit
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:52:31] cool whats the trivial definition of the constant coefficient difference series for x^x^x^x ?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:53:15] im not talking about recurrence relations or linear recurrence lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:53:20] whats the real life scenario you saw it
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:53:23] I barely even see x^x
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:53:26] that furthers my point that in math recurssion is trivial
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:53:30] let alone 4 tet x
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:53:37] and thus maths doesnt really touch on anything complex most of the time because of this fault
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:54:12] david_hilbert: real life scenario for general recurssion? uh let me see
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:54:15] fibonocci numbers?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:54:19] would be a trivial example lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:54:29] Which as I said is a trivial second order difference equation
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:54:29] the linear relations you were talking about before
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:54:39] trivial iterative form
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:54:48] your definition of second order and mine are completely different
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:54:51] mines functional in definition
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:54:55] yours is arbitrary
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:55:00] thats how difference equations are defined
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:55:02] a subset of mine
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:55:05] their order is the number of past terms they depend on
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:55:21] david_hilbert: iteratitive solutions can be written as recursive solutions
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:55:26] thats maths 101
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:55:37] so i dont get your point? in fact, its wrong
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:55:52] recursion is more powerful
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:55:57] iteration requires countable sets
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:56:10] and a successor function
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:56:19] its why maths avoids the concept or tries to
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:56:47] its why it tries to define the 'order' or 'dimension' of something independent of the operator lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:57:06] cause its scared of the powerful construct
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:57:32] *more powerful*
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:58:18] induction is the most powerful tool in maths to deal with recursion currently
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:58:37] and computer science avoids recursion too except when its easily proven to terminate in a bounded (even more strict than finite) steps
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:58:38] but theres no tools to deal with general recursion
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:59:29] Theres no tools to deal with general graphs either and thats what general recursion is: a general tree/dag
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[01:59:38] im just saying, dont tell me a dude deserves the fields medal when he avoids the elephant in the room
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:59:49] Mathematicians are smart people
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[01:59:52] Programmers are also smart people
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:00:37] david_hilbert: no, theres many tools in programming to deal with general recurssion its far more sophisticated than maths
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:00:46] How so?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:00:47] at this particular thing
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:01:08] in fact its pretty much gonna take the place of maths one day soon i think
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:01:10] Tell me how you prove some general, programmatically generated graph to be bounded etc
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:01:17] its becoming more and more abstract and functional
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:02:00] only room for one star in STEM
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:02:08] Bullshit
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:02:11] david_hilbert: why do you keep reverting back to graph theory
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:02:14] Mathematics and programming serve different goals
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:02:15] david_hilbert: please don't feed the troll
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:02:18] you think thats only way to deal with general recursion lol?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:02:22] johndoe_, because a graph is what a recursion is
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:03:07] LISP people who read that lambda book can float in the clouds all day, its the people who understand the reality of registers, buses and cpus who get shit done
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:03:31] And therein programming is a very different field from math
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:03:38] Programming is the control of digital hardware
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:03:41] Mathematics is other things
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:03:58] Mathematics for example isn't bounded, even when "merely" finite...let alone infinite
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:04:05] Programs always are bounded
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:04:36] the problem is the only modern mathematical abstraction for recursion is a graph currently (besides induction). thats a discrete structure
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:04:40] again requires countable sets lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:04:44] theres no functional definition
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:04:50] And what magical stuff does CS have?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:04:53] that avoids these problems
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:04:55] even though maths invented set theory and likes to think of itself as built on functions
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:05:04] it cant handle the most powerful functions
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:05:13] so it comes up with discrete graphs
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:05:25] pathetic imo
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:05:32] Turing himself stated computer functions are sometimes so complex, you can't even prove they finish and return a result
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:05:44] yep
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:05:49] and yet every math problem has a solution lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:05:53] it seems
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:05:59] you maths ppl are so smart!
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:06:10] So whats the point in using such dangerous tools in the manner of "proofs"?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:06:18] we can't even ensure it will temrinate in the general case
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:06:22] also you think mathematics isnt bounded?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:06:27] It isn't
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:06:27] it most certainly is
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:06:35] Even something with a "finite" set of steps is unbounded
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:06:44] 10 is finite, 10^100 is ,10 ^100^100 is finite
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:06:51] proofs are bounded no?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:06:56] programs arent
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:07:02] Boundedness is a far stricter criterion than just finiteness
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:07:02] they can have infinite loops even trivial ones
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:07:06] theres no infinite proof lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:07:25] Bounds such as max so and so steps, and so and so memory cells are what programming needs
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:07:33] Which mathematics often doesen't bother with
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:07:59] it "needs" that stuff to deal with general recursion lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:08:02] and non trivial problems
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:08:11] and math not bothering with "that stuff" is whole reason why its trivial beyond calculus
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:08:26] or at least not used beyond theoretical physics
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:08:40] you dudes cant deal with recursion well
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:08:41] and wont admit it
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:08:57] or that the solution is a turing machine or something equivalent
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:09:14] Turing machines are by definition not tractable in the general case
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:09:21] So I fail to see how they can be useful tools for thought
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:09:33] well not by definition, but the point still holds
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:09:37] and that's precisely why theyre so expression and efficient at dealing with real world problems and non trivial problems in general
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:09:42] its a trade-off
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:09:54] johndoe_: primitive recursive functions is a mathematical construct
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:09:57] usefulness and expressiveness vs strict formal rigour to describe trivial nonsense problems
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:09:57] The computer based mathematical proofs have had lots of advancements but its really wrong to claim somehow programming and math can tackle the same kinds of problems
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:10:06] Programming is the control of digital hardware first and foremost
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:10:12] and was a model of computation before turing finalized his notion of turing machine
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:10:38] turing machines is a mthematical construct too
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:11:08] you should also look up universal algebras
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:11:17] Programming isn't head in the clouds philosophical thinking
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:11:31] its the dirty, ugly business of dealing with networks, buses, interrupts, locks etc
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:11:35] Fangs: you should look up recursion
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:12:01] another one for the ignore list, it seems
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:12:17] anything built on FIRST -ORDER logic is first order
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:12:24] including universal algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:12:29] Fangs: yep welcome to my ignore list
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:13:04] epsilon -deltas are a first-order way to deal with recursion as well but
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:13:18] its still highly bounded
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:13:19] I think I read first order logic is equivalent to turing machines
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:13:25] Turing machines are no more powerful
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:14:24] or no less powerful at that
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:14:27] I can solve general recursive programming problems without issue. If I were to try and express that as a mathematical concept I'd fall short
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:14:27] They are equivalent
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:14:30] its simple as that
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:14:32] really
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:14:43] turing machines have nothing to do with it
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:14:55] they are a mathematical object themselves
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:15:04] so of course they fall short as well
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:15:21] programming on other hand can deal with general recursion because it makes certain tradeoffs in terms of rigour and formality
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:15:25] that it gains in expressiveness
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:15:37] Whatever computer science you have in your head is also a mathematics, an abstract kind because it doesn't exist in real life
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:15:44] real life is finite and bounded
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:16:19] and mathematics belongs to logic and logic belongs to philosophy
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:16:20] so what
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:16:42] None of that is equivalent ot real life programming
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:16:54] come up with an abstract machine that can deal with state and general recursion and youll have my respect
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:16:55] Real life programming is finite and bounded, heavily so, in time and space
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:17:35] mathematical objects should be able to change state
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:17:37] in formal ways
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:17:52] during course of the proof
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:18:39] instead, it uses round about ways to encode it in ridiculously complex and unnecessary abstractions
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:19:15] I agree that state change is useful and important and the FP philosophers face problems because of trying to avoid it
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:19:15] example is weierstrass function
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:19:35] the fact that that is an object of study means theres a problem and its only 'best way' to encode state
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:19:38] in proofs
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:20:51] polynomials could probably be eliminated if there were a trivial concept of a 'loop'
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:20:58] a finite sequence of steps that was easily expressable
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:21:17] as [n, x, lower order function]
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:21:25] I agree strongly with you that in the programming context the "pure FP" types are heavily misguided
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:21:28] Definitely agree++
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:22:11] no I mean in math not programming
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:22:15] proofs lack basic abstractions
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:22:18] that a 5 year old knows
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:22:39] they lack even the most trivial concept of state or control structures beyond if statements
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:22:57] thats why maths is so complex but only solves trivial problems or complex useless problem
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:23:10] you could literally eliminate modern algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:23:22] by making a basic finite loop standard syntax in a formal proof
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:23:50] we already have the summation symbol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:24:05] of course its not a general loop
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:25:45] imagine what you could do with a simple, general loop
2021-07-17 15:00:41	dude12312414	[02:26:03] johndoe_: i have to disagree with "you could literally eliminate modern algebra", or at least, ask for more evidence that there is a decent alternative
2021-07-17 15:00:41	dude12312414	[02:26:44] because modern algebra seems to be quite essential for many results even outside of algebra itself, such as number theory
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:28:16] dude12312414: thats not an essential dependency its contrived
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:28:47] I mean, imagine if you could program using general abstractions and compose them like in a loop
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:29:06] 100 page proofs would ge reduced to succint 1 page proofs
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:29:13] itd eliminate a lot of garbage
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:29:17] patterns would start to emerge
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:29:25] standard libraries of proofs would be formed
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:29:34] that you could import into your own proof as pure abstraction
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:29:35] But the very point of general programs is that they are, per turing, intractable
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:29:41] YOu cannot say anything about its output
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:29:44] or even if it will finish
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:29:49] thats the grand lie
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:29:54] you dont need to
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:30:03] The restrictions of mathematical proofs are what lets them well be proofs
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:30:05] sure, theres limits to logical positivism
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:30:13] not all truths are mathematical
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:30:25] but surely you can have a single finite and formally defined loop
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:30:34] the concept is well defined and well applied
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:30:48] the very idea you cant have a loop in proofs is insane
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:31:02] its logically sound, think about it
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:31:38] its time to advance Principia Mathematica
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:31:42] to add in loops
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:31:57] a WHILE loop
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:31:59] not a fucking for loop
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:32:01] not a discrete loop
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:32:08] a simple WHILE loop to deal with recursion
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:32:21] and youll prove Riemann hypothesis and P=NP
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:32:25] but while and for have equal power
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:32:39] thats another lie
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:32:47] for is discrete
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:32:51] requies a counter
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:32:53] I can exactly transform a for into a while
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:32:55] and vice versa
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:33:19] everything has a counter
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:33:23] the cpu has a program counter register
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:33:28] good luck trying to formalize a for in a way thats acceptable
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:33:37] a while is easy
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:33:43] why go discrete?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:33:49] how would you deal with for x in R?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	loopspace	[02:33:52] Why so cranky?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:33:59] R is a subtle issue
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:34:32] and arguably we already do x over R when it makes sense when we are doing an integration
2021-07-17 15:00:41	david_hilbert	[02:35:07] Mathematicians are a smart bunch. And so are computer science people.
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:35:10] oh yea, the 'limit'
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:35:16] cool concept
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:35:20] avoids a loop
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:35:38] loopspace: any interesting problem?
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:35:42] anything is better than this
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:36:03] david_hilbert: no set theory does x in R thats it
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:36:09] for x in R? lol no
2021-07-17 15:00:41	loopspace	[02:36:28] Fangs: maybe when I get to the end of this current section of the book
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:36:37] in / if statements, variables. you dudes are operating at 1% capacity
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:36:49] loopspace: im not cranky ? lol
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:37:04] im glad people are finally acknowledging this
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:37:10] ive been saying it for over 10 years
2021-07-17 15:00:41	johndoe_	[02:37:28] I have papers on it
2021-07-17 15:00:41	loopspace	[02:37:33] Fangs: here's a preview  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mYcY8Q51/exercises.png
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:37:49] loopspace: since you mentioned group rings yesterday, something crossed my mind. group rings are hopf algebras, note ZG -> ZG (x) ZG (tensored over Z) with g -> g(x)1 + 1(x)g
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:38:04] wonder if you'd know anything about holf algebra
2021-07-17 15:00:41	Fangs	[02:38:41] 9.12 I didn't realize they were adjoint pairs
2021-07-17 15:00:42	loopspace	[02:38:54] Fangs: watching a movie rn but may get to those tonight. Afk for a bit. Will also read your posts a bit later
2021-07-17 15:00:42	johndoe_	[02:42:21] *yawn* holf algebras
2021-07-17 15:00:42	johndoe_	[02:42:22] bbl
2021-07-17 15:00:42	johndoe_	[02:42:47] maybe when someone of my caliber comes back
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[04:38:27] Hi. I'd like to solve tanh(x)/x=y in terms of x, is this possible?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:39:27] cokernel_hacker: I'm not sure what there is to solve there
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:39:29] depends in what way
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:39:34] y in terms of x is just as given
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:39:39] numerically you can compute x up to arbitrary precision
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:39:56] ah, given y, solve x
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:40:02] analytically there is no elementary function whose inverse is tanh(x)/x
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[04:40:06] yes, exactly
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[04:40:12] ok, so I need to solve it numerically
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:40:17] but you could probably do something with Lambert-W functions or something
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:42:10] (this is unrelated, but isn't what cokernel_hacker want is to solve the equation in terms of y?)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:43:04] well that's trivial
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:13] I want x s.t. tanh(x)/x=1/2
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:42] there are two solutions which are approximately -1.91501 and 1.91501
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:43:58] I've forgotten most math terms. I thought what's trivial is to solve y in terms of x
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:44:05] (you just plug in x into tanh(x) and divide it by x)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[04:44:07] I wanted an analytical solution :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:44:32] Fangs: oh sorry yeah i misunderstood
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[04:46:24] sorry if I am not understanding, is there an easy solution to my query?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:48:32] numerically you can use the Newton-Raphson algorithm, which should be pretty straightforward
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:49:08] but if you want a closed form expression for x in terms of y, you're out of luck i think. at least WA can't find an elementary inverse
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:49:25] if you're willing to use 'special functions
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:49:54] e(x) - e(-x)/(e(x) + e(-x))= x/2  ---> 2[e(2x) - 1] = x[e(2x) +1] --> 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:50:06] *'special functions' then you may or may not be able to get a formula, depending on which special functions you accept
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:51:49] supposing x > 0, 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2 -> 2e(2x) - e(log(x)) e(2x) - e(log(x)) = 2
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:52:23] I don't think there's a way to factor out the x's so you can just take the log of both sides can you?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	TOB_CyxoB	[04:53:20] cokernel_hacker, just plugged it in into maxima: x=log(-sqrt(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))) ; x=log(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))/2
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:53:25] as a rule of thumb, things that mix exponentials with polynomials of x won't have elementary inverses unless there's some "obvious" simplification
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:53:35] i don't have a proof of this
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:53:44] but it usually ends up being the case
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:54:01] that's believable, and I didn't think you'd be able to solve it. I just wanted to try anyway and see where the difficulty is
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:54:15] (*I didn't think I'd be able to solve it, more precisely)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[04:55:34] TOB_CyxoB: that looked promising but using y=1/2 seems to give me something different from the numerical solution
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:57:00] i think they solved for tanh(x) = y
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:57:18] since I'm bored, can we do calculus for this?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:57:36] so we're basically solving for the difference between two functions tanh(x) - 2x = 0
2021-07-17 15:00:42	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:17] cokernel_hacker, x=0.54931 (exp(x*2)-1)/(exp(x*2)+1)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[04:58:17] we want to minimize this, naively, but 0 might not be minimum.. so idk.. (tanh(x) - 2x)^2 insead
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[04:58:20] with calculus you could prove things like "there are exactly n solutions for y in some subset"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:46] cokernel_hacker, seems to produce 1/2
2021-07-17 15:00:42	TOB_CyxoB	[04:59:46] cokernel_hacker, the other one is comples as in: 0.54931 + 3.14159i
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:00] TOB_CyxoB: d'oh
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:09] indeed, tanh(log(-.5/(.5-1)-1/(.5-1))/2) is 1/2
2021-07-17 15:00:42	TOB_CyxoB	[05:00:51] *complex
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[05:00:52] 2 (-2 + sech^2(x)) (-2 x + tanh(x)) = 0
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[05:01:00] dude12312414: this is so much less tracable
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[05:01:02] was the original question to solve tanh(x)/x = y or tanh(x) = y?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[05:01:03] its cursed
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cokernel_hacker	[05:01:10] tanh(x)/x = y
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[05:01:18] ok
2021-07-17 15:00:42	TOB_CyxoB	[05:01:50] Oh... sorry
2021-07-17 15:00:42	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:36] dear maxima managed to reduce it to x=(%e^(2*x)-1)/(%e^(2*x)*y+y)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:57] I guess than Newton comes in...
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[05:03:49] actually nvm.. -2 + sech^2(x) is never zero.. so that equation is only zero when (-2 x + tanh(x)) , which is the original problem..
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[05:10:47] uh
2021-07-17 15:00:42	dude12312414	[05:11:08] oh yeah nevermind
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[07:25:51] buster: you're a math physics-leaning guy right?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[07:26:04] buster: how much connection are there between discrete mathematics and math physics?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[07:52:07] I am a theoretical physicist, my favorite phys/math/CS area is enumerative combinatorics, and I am not ready to give a definite answer
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[07:52:31] I guess I'll join the group waiting for buster's answer
2021-07-17 15:00:42	riv	[07:53:04] which area of physics?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[07:53:46] Statistical physics / condensed matter
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[07:56:31] We have Rogers-Ramanujan identities in stat.phys. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[07:58:16] cherim_: do you know anything about operation research?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[07:58:41] if you're in charge of a maths dept, would you rather tack the discrete math folks with the math physics people? or the operation research people?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-17 15:00:42	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are

2021-07-17 15:35:50	tempate	So I thought I'd first show that it's an algebraic set and then I would show that it's irreducible. I believe it's an algebraic set because it's the zeros of f(x, y, z) = x^3 + xy - 2z
2021-07-17 15:36:29	TheWild	the problem with polynomials is that for infinitely many points the... they just do not seem to work in practice because of mindbogglingly huge numbers.
2021-07-17 15:36:57	TheWild	or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
2021-07-17 15:43:28	Fangs	tempate: what about (0,1,0)
2021-07-17 15:43:37	Fangs	is that a zero of your polynomial?

2021-07-17 15:49:51	Fangs	tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
2021-07-17 15:50:10	tempate	Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
2021-07-17 15:50:19	Fangs	(can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
2021-07-17 15:50:40	Fangs	tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
2021-07-17 15:51:31	Fangs	tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
2021-07-17 15:51:36	tempate	I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
2021-07-17 15:52:04	Fangs	just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
2021-07-17 15:52:16	tempate	Yeah, right
2021-07-17 15:52:47	tempate	so... V(y, z) ?
2021-07-17 15:52:55	Fangs	tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
2021-07-17 15:53:10	Fangs	and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
2021-07-17 15:53:10	TheWild	Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?
2021-07-17 15:53:10	TheWild	hmm... interesting. Let's put it into formula and check how it looks like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
2021-07-17 15:53:19	tempate	Yes, I am
2021-07-17 15:53:33	Fangs	TheWild: I'm sorry but I wasn't answering your question. I don't really know anything about interpolation
2021-07-17 15:53:52	TheWild	anyway, it gave me some idea
2021-07-17 15:54:21	Fangs	tempate: here's a heuristics.. I think this is a 'safe' heuristics for algebraic sets over R and C, but when you get over more exotic rings you might want to ask someone more qualified
2021-07-17 15:54:43	tempate	fair enough
2021-07-17 15:54:48	Fangs	tempate: a k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space will have to be described by (n-k) polynomials

2021-07-17 15:55:49	tempate	ok
2021-07-17 15:56:05	Fangs	its a heuristic in the sense that there are singularities, and ofc degenerate cases like (x^2+y^2 = 0) doesnt describe a surface in R^2
2021-07-17 15:56:09	tempate	so we could have V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) for our original problem?

2021-07-17 16:09:10	Fangs	tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-17 16:09:24	Fangs	or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-17 16:09:43	Fangs	I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-17 16:09:55	tempate	yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-17 16:10:15	tempate	I believe you also have to throw in I != R

2021-07-17 16:15:10	acresearch	people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-17 16:15:12	acresearch	makes sense?
2021-07-17 16:15:16	buster	the image of a in the quotient
2021-07-17 16:15:25	Fangs	oh nvm I'm an idiot
2021-07-17 16:15:30	Fangs	I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-17 16:16:52	Fangs	also what buster said

2021-07-17 16:19:05	tempate	acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-17 16:20:03	tempate	if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-17 16:20:27	Inline	if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-17 16:20:28	tempate	Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-17 16:21:45	Inline	as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....

2021-07-17 16:22:47	acresearch	tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-17 16:23:07	Fangs	tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-17 16:23:30	Fangs	if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-17 16:23:39	Fangs	and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-17 16:24:06	buster	acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-17 16:24:28	acresearch	buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate

2021-07-17 16:25:40	buster	one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-17 16:25:53	Fangs	tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 16:26:38	Fangs	so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-17 16:27:09	Fangs	(and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)

2021-07-17 16:52:51	rubiksdream	Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-17 16:53:10	zacts	I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-17 16:53:39	rubiksdream	but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-17 16:54:05	rubiksdream	so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-17 16:54:08	Fangs	is |x| convex?
2021-07-17 16:54:17	Fangs	or maybe -|x|
2021-07-17 16:54:27	rubiksdream	yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-17 16:54:33	rubiksdream	|x|
2021-07-17 16:54:52	rubiksdream	-|x| is concave
2021-07-17 16:54:54	Fangs	ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-17 16:55:08	Fangs	or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-17 16:55:18	rubiksdream	its an affirmative example
2021-07-17 16:55:24	rubiksdream	so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-17 16:55:30	Fangs	yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-17 16:55:30	buster	an example
2021-07-17 16:55:41	rubiksdream	no worries
2021-07-17 16:56:03	rubiksdream	anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-17 16:56:11	buster	anticountermeasure
2021-07-17 16:56:39	rubiksdream	so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-17 16:56:49	zacts	I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-17 16:56:53	rubiksdream	similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-17 16:56:59	rubiksdream	so both limits exist
2021-07-17 16:57:24	Fangs	I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-17 16:58:12	rubiksdream	now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above

2021-07-17 17:01:10	Fangs	rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-17 17:01:21	Fangs	(I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-17 17:01:35	Fangs	then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-17 17:02:21	rubiksdream	yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-17 17:02:51	Fangs	I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-17 17:03:16	Fangs	rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-17 17:03:27	Fangs	and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff

2021-07-17 17:04:02	Fangs	maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-17 17:04:43	Fangs	then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-17 17:05:45	Fangs	I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain

2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:07:02] they can have infinite loops even trivial ones
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:07:06] theres no infinite proof lol
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:07:25] Bounds such as max so and so steps, and so and so memory cells are what programming needs
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:07:33] Which mathematics often doesen't bother with
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:07:59] it "needs" that stuff to deal with general recursion lol
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:08:02] and non trivial problems
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:08:11] and math not bothering with "that stuff" is whole reason why its trivial beyond calculus
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:08:26] or at least not used beyond theoretical physics
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:08:40] you dudes cant deal with recursion well
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:08:41] and wont admit it
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:08:57] or that the solution is a turing machine or something equivalent
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:09:14] Turing machines are by definition not tractable in the general case
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:09:21] So I fail to see how they can be useful tools for thought
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:09:33] well not by definition, but the point still holds
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:09:37] and that's precisely why theyre so expression and efficient at dealing with real world problems and non trivial problems in general
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:09:42] its a trade-off
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:09:54] johndoe_: primitive recursive functions is a mathematical construct
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:09:57] usefulness and expressiveness vs strict formal rigour to describe trivial nonsense problems
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:09:57] The computer based mathematical proofs have had lots of advancements but its really wrong to claim somehow programming and math can tackle the same kinds of problems
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:10:06] Programming is the control of digital hardware first and foremost
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:10:12] and was a model of computation before turing finalized his notion of turing machine
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:10:38] turing machines is a mthematical construct too
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:11:08] you should also look up universal algebras
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:11:17] Programming isn't head in the clouds philosophical thinking
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:11:31] its the dirty, ugly business of dealing with networks, buses, interrupts, locks etc
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:11:35] Fangs: you should look up recursion
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:12:01] another one for the ignore list, it seems
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:12:17] anything built on FIRST -ORDER logic is first order
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:12:24] including universal algebra
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:12:29] Fangs: yep welcome to my ignore list
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:13:04] epsilon -deltas are a first-order way to deal with recursion as well but
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:13:18] its still highly bounded
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:13:19] I think I read first order logic is equivalent to turing machines
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:13:25] Turing machines are no more powerful
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:14:24] or no less powerful at that
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:14:27] I can solve general recursive programming problems without issue. If I were to try and express that as a mathematical concept I'd fall short
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:14:27] They are equivalent
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:14:30] its simple as that
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:14:32] really
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:14:43] turing machines have nothing to do with it
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:14:55] they are a mathematical object themselves
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:15:04] so of course they fall short as well
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:15:21] programming on other hand can deal with general recursion because it makes certain tradeoffs in terms of rigour and formality
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:15:25] that it gains in expressiveness
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:15:37] Whatever computer science you have in your head is also a mathematics, an abstract kind because it doesn't exist in real life
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:15:44] real life is finite and bounded
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:16:19] and mathematics belongs to logic and logic belongs to philosophy
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:16:20] so what
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:16:42] None of that is equivalent ot real life programming
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:16:54] come up with an abstract machine that can deal with state and general recursion and youll have my respect
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:16:55] Real life programming is finite and bounded, heavily so, in time and space
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:17:35] mathematical objects should be able to change state
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:17:37] in formal ways
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:17:52] during course of the proof
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:18:39] instead, it uses round about ways to encode it in ridiculously complex and unnecessary abstractions
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:19:15] I agree that state change is useful and important and the FP philosophers face problems because of trying to avoid it
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:19:15] example is weierstrass function
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:19:35] the fact that that is an object of study means theres a problem and its only 'best way' to encode state
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:19:38] in proofs
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:20:51] polynomials could probably be eliminated if there were a trivial concept of a 'loop'
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:20:58] a finite sequence of steps that was easily expressable
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:21:17] as [n, x, lower order function]
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:21:25] I agree strongly with you that in the programming context the "pure FP" types are heavily misguided
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:21:28] Definitely agree++
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:22:11] no I mean in math not programming
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:22:15] proofs lack basic abstractions
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:22:18] that a 5 year old knows
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:22:39] they lack even the most trivial concept of state or control structures beyond if statements
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:22:57] thats why maths is so complex but only solves trivial problems or complex useless problem
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:23:10] you could literally eliminate modern algebra
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:23:22] by making a basic finite loop standard syntax in a formal proof
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:23:50] we already have the summation symbol
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:24:05] of course its not a general loop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:25:45] imagine what you could do with a simple, general loop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[02:26:03] johndoe_: i have to disagree with "you could literally eliminate modern algebra", or at least, ask for more evidence that there is a decent alternative
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[02:26:44] because modern algebra seems to be quite essential for many results even outside of algebra itself, such as number theory
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:28:16] dude12312414: thats not an essential dependency its contrived
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:28:47] I mean, imagine if you could program using general abstractions and compose them like in a loop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:29:06] 100 page proofs would ge reduced to succint 1 page proofs
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:29:13] itd eliminate a lot of garbage
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:29:17] patterns would start to emerge
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:29:25] standard libraries of proofs would be formed
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:29:34] that you could import into your own proof as pure abstraction
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:29:35] But the very point of general programs is that they are, per turing, intractable
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:29:41] YOu cannot say anything about its output
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:29:44] or even if it will finish
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:29:49] thats the grand lie
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:29:54] you dont need to
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:30:03] The restrictions of mathematical proofs are what lets them well be proofs
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:30:05] sure, theres limits to logical positivism
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:30:13] not all truths are mathematical
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:30:25] but surely you can have a single finite and formally defined loop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:30:34] the concept is well defined and well applied
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:30:48] the very idea you cant have a loop in proofs is insane
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:31:02] its logically sound, think about it
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:31:38] its time to advance Principia Mathematica
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:31:42] to add in loops
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:31:57] a WHILE loop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:31:59] not a fucking for loop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:32:01] not a discrete loop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:32:08] a simple WHILE loop to deal with recursion
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:32:21] and youll prove Riemann hypothesis and P=NP
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:32:25] but while and for have equal power
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:32:39] thats another lie
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:32:47] for is discrete
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:32:51] requies a counter
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:32:53] I can exactly transform a for into a while
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:32:55] and vice versa
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:33:19] everything has a counter
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:33:23] the cpu has a program counter register
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:33:28] good luck trying to formalize a for in a way thats acceptable
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:33:37] a while is easy
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:33:43] why go discrete?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:33:49] how would you deal with for x in R?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	loopspace	[02:33:52] Why so cranky?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:33:59] R is a subtle issue
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:34:32] and arguably we already do x over R when it makes sense when we are doing an integration
2021-07-17 19:43:51	david_hilbert	[02:35:07] Mathematicians are a smart bunch. And so are computer science people.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:35:10] oh yea, the 'limit'
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:35:16] cool concept
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:35:20] avoids a loop
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:35:38] loopspace: any interesting problem?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:35:42] anything is better than this
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:36:03] david_hilbert: no set theory does x in R thats it
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:36:09] for x in R? lol no
2021-07-17 19:43:51	loopspace	[02:36:28] Fangs: maybe when I get to the end of this current section of the book
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:36:37] in / if statements, variables. you dudes are operating at 1% capacity
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:36:49] loopspace: im not cranky ? lol
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:37:04] im glad people are finally acknowledging this
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:37:10] ive been saying it for over 10 years
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:37:28] I have papers on it
2021-07-17 19:43:51	loopspace	[02:37:33] Fangs: here's a preview  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mYcY8Q51/exercises.png
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:37:49] loopspace: since you mentioned group rings yesterday, something crossed my mind. group rings are hopf algebras, note ZG -> ZG (x) ZG (tensored over Z) with g -> g(x)1 + 1(x)g
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:38:04] wonder if you'd know anything about holf algebra
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[02:38:41] 9.12 I didn't realize they were adjoint pairs
2021-07-17 19:43:51	loopspace	[02:38:54] Fangs: watching a movie rn but may get to those tonight. Afk for a bit. Will also read your posts a bit later
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:42:21] *yawn* holf algebras
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:42:22] bbl
2021-07-17 19:43:51	johndoe_	[02:42:47] maybe when someone of my caliber comes back
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[04:38:27] Hi. I'd like to solve tanh(x)/x=y in terms of x, is this possible?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:39:27] cokernel_hacker: I'm not sure what there is to solve there
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:39:29] depends in what way
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:39:34] y in terms of x is just as given
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:39:39] numerically you can compute x up to arbitrary precision
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:39:56] ah, given y, solve x
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:40:02] analytically there is no elementary function whose inverse is tanh(x)/x
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[04:40:06] yes, exactly
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[04:40:12] ok, so I need to solve it numerically
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:40:17] but you could probably do something with Lambert-W functions or something
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:42:10] (this is unrelated, but isn't what cokernel_hacker want is to solve the equation in terms of y?)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:43:04] well that's trivial
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:13] I want x s.t. tanh(x)/x=1/2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:42] there are two solutions which are approximately -1.91501 and 1.91501
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:43:58] I've forgotten most math terms. I thought what's trivial is to solve y in terms of x
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:44:05] (you just plug in x into tanh(x) and divide it by x)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[04:44:07] I wanted an analytical solution :)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:44:32] Fangs: oh sorry yeah i misunderstood
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[04:46:24] sorry if I am not understanding, is there an easy solution to my query?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:48:32] numerically you can use the Newton-Raphson algorithm, which should be pretty straightforward
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:49:08] but if you want a closed form expression for x in terms of y, you're out of luck i think. at least WA can't find an elementary inverse
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:49:25] if you're willing to use 'special functions
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:49:54] e(x) - e(-x)/(e(x) + e(-x))= x/2  ---> 2[e(2x) - 1] = x[e(2x) +1] --> 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:50:06] *'special functions' then you may or may not be able to get a formula, depending on which special functions you accept
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:51:49] supposing x > 0, 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2 -> 2e(2x) - e(log(x)) e(2x) - e(log(x)) = 2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:52:23] I don't think there's a way to factor out the x's so you can just take the log of both sides can you?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TOB_CyxoB	[04:53:20] cokernel_hacker, just plugged it in into maxima: x=log(-sqrt(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))) ; x=log(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))/2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:53:25] as a rule of thumb, things that mix exponentials with polynomials of x won't have elementary inverses unless there's some "obvious" simplification
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:53:35] i don't have a proof of this
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:53:44] but it usually ends up being the case
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:54:01] that's believable, and I didn't think you'd be able to solve it. I just wanted to try anyway and see where the difficulty is
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:54:15] (*I didn't think I'd be able to solve it, more precisely)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[04:55:34] TOB_CyxoB: that looked promising but using y=1/2 seems to give me something different from the numerical solution
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:57:00] i think they solved for tanh(x) = y
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:57:18] since I'm bored, can we do calculus for this?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:57:36] so we're basically solving for the difference between two functions tanh(x) - 2x = 0
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:17] cokernel_hacker, x=0.54931 (exp(x*2)-1)/(exp(x*2)+1)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[04:58:17] we want to minimize this, naively, but 0 might not be minimum.. so idk.. (tanh(x) - 2x)^2 insead
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[04:58:20] with calculus you could prove things like "there are exactly n solutions for y in some subset"
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:46] cokernel_hacker, seems to produce 1/2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TOB_CyxoB	[04:59:46] cokernel_hacker, the other one is comples as in: 0.54931 + 3.14159i
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:00] TOB_CyxoB: d'oh
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:09] indeed, tanh(log(-.5/(.5-1)-1/(.5-1))/2) is 1/2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TOB_CyxoB	[05:00:51] *complex
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[05:00:52] 2 (-2 + sech^2(x)) (-2 x + tanh(x)) = 0
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[05:01:00] dude12312414: this is so much less tracable
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[05:01:02] was the original question to solve tanh(x)/x = y or tanh(x) = y?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[05:01:03] its cursed
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cokernel_hacker	[05:01:10] tanh(x)/x = y
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[05:01:18] ok
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TOB_CyxoB	[05:01:50] Oh... sorry
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:36] dear maxima managed to reduce it to x=(%e^(2*x)-1)/(%e^(2*x)*y+y)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:57] I guess than Newton comes in...
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[05:03:49] actually nvm.. -2 + sech^2(x) is never zero.. so that equation is only zero when (-2 x + tanh(x)) , which is the original problem..
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[05:10:47] uh
2021-07-17 19:43:51	dude12312414	[05:11:08] oh yeah nevermind
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[07:25:51] buster: you're a math physics-leaning guy right?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[07:26:04] buster: how much connection are there between discrete mathematics and math physics?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[07:52:07] I am a theoretical physicist, my favorite phys/math/CS area is enumerative combinatorics, and I am not ready to give a definite answer
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[07:52:31] I guess I'll join the group waiting for buster's answer
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[07:53:04] which area of physics?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[07:53:46] Statistical physics / condensed matter
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[07:56:31] We have Rogers-Ramanujan identities in stat.phys. :)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[07:58:16] cherim_: do you know anything about operation research?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[07:58:41] if you're in charge of a maths dept, would you rather tack the discrete math folks with the math physics people? or the operation research people?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-17 19:43:51	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[09:45:22] hello
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[09:51:03] an interpolating function for infinitely many points, infinitely differentiable (eventually to a constant), not necessarily differentiable everywhere. The function is expected to take "minimum energy state", that is, without little monsters like sin(x) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#/media/File:Gamma_plus_sin_pi_z.svg
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[09:51:03] Do you know of such a function/method?  It's not a quation I know the answer for.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:02:20] TheWild: I believe every polynomial is infinitely differentiable
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:03:09] What's the standard approach to prove that an algebraic set is irreducible?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:04:11] In particular, I have to show that {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k} is a variety.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:05:50] So I thought I'd first show that it's an algebraic set and then I would show that it's irreducible. I believe it's an algebraic set because it's the zeros of f(x, y, z) = x^3 + xy - 2z
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[10:06:29] the problem with polynomials is that for infinitely many points the... they just do not seem to work in practice because of mindbogglingly huge numbers.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[10:06:57] or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:13:28] tempate: what about (0,1,0)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:13:37] is that a zero of your polynomial?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:17:47] Fangs: I guess it is
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:18:21] tempate: your 'space' is included in the zero of your polynomial, but its not equal to
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:18:28] Fangs: maybe f(x, y, z) = x^3 + sqrt(y^3) - 2z is better?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:18:29] so its not the zeros of your polynomial
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:18:38] that's not apolynomial
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:18:59] Hmmm
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:19:05] tempate: I recall having this conversation before, didn't I gave your variety as the zero of two polynomials?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:19:27] tempate: let's... not get too fancy. lets take the real line in R^3
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:19:40] the real line (t,0,0), t in R
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:19:50] tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:20:10] Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:20:19] (can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:20:40] tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:21:31] tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:21:36] I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:22:04] just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:22:15] Yeah, right
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:22:47] so... V(y, z) ?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:22:54] tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:23:10] and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[10:23:10] Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[10:23:10] hmm... interesting. Let's put it into formula and check how it looks like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:23:19] Yes, I am
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:23:33] TheWild: I'm sorry but I wasn't answering your question. I don't really know anything about interpolation
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[10:23:51] anyway, it gave me some idea
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:24:21] tempate: here's a heuristics.. I think this is a 'safe' heuristics for algebraic sets over R and C, but when you get over more exotic rings you might want to ask someone more qualified
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:24:43] fair enough
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:24:47] tempate: a k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space will have to be described by (n-k) polynomials
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:25:37] or I guess (n-k) polynomials describes a k dimensional object in R^n or C^n
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:25:49] ok
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:26:05] its a heuristic in the sense that there are singularities, and ofc degenerate cases like (x^2+y^2 = 0) doesnt describe a surface in R^2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:26:09] so we could have V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) for our original problem?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:26:12] (in R^3 sorry)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:26:35] tempate: you might want to check, show that you dont end up with extra points, and all points are included
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:27:04] how can I make sure that no extra points are included though?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:28:38] it's fairly clear here that y must be x^2 and z must be x^3
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:28:53]  ok.. I don't know the fancy alg geom stuff, I can only work with ideals where the elements are functions on the space itself.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:29:28] tempate: but I thought this statement is true: if x is a pt in V(p1,...,pn) then p1(x) = 0, ..., pn(x) = 0
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:29:47] yes, that's correct
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:29:49] (I thought thats how you define V(I)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:29:51] (I thought thats how you define V(I))
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:30:25] tempate: so let p be a point in V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , and show that p is in {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k}
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:30:43] this ammount to finding t such that p = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:31:15] (tempate also if you can't tell I'm a bit aprehensive about alg geom lol)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:31:26] heh, yeah, don't worry
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:31:31] TheWild: did your idea work?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:31:31] you're helping me a lot
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:32:23] In any case, say that V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) works for our case. How would I show that it's irreducible?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:32:49] this would be an area where you're probably more qualified to answer than I am
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[10:32:57] actually I'm bugged by other dude... but I'm going to check that out
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:33:13] tempate: but I thought for certain rings, irreducible <-> prime ideal (or some other condition on the ideal?)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	 *	tempate [10:33:33] checks his notes
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:33:49] tempate: the name of the game is to translate geometric description into a statement about the corresponding ideal/or the quotient ring
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:34:27] tempate: which book are you reading? I might join in lol
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:35:03] Yeah, it's a corollary from Hilbert's Nullstellenstaz apparently: if I is a prime ideal, V(I) is irreducible.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:35:32] (I think it goes both ways but I'm not sure)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	buster	[10:35:37] Fangs, cherim_, great question! no idea
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:35:43] Fangs: Algebraic Curves by Fulton
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:36:06] Fangs: I'm in the second chapter now, so you're by no means late to the party
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:36:22] oh thats a commonly recommended one, and its not hearthsorne
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:36:43] *hartshorne
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:37:20] it'd be great for you to join, but no pressure
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:38:32] so the plan now is to show that it's a prime ideal, eh
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:38:47] oh 1.3 even
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:39:10] tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:39:24] or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:39:43] I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:39:55] yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:40:15] I believe you also have to throw in I != R
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:40:29] yeah
2021-07-17 19:43:51	TheWild	[10:42:09] Fangs: this gonna get funny if I somewhat end up with sinc :D
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:42:55] do you know what a (with a dash hovering over it) is supposed to stand for?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:43:27] as here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2154432/show-that-the-ideal-is-prime

2021-07-17 19:43:51	acresearch	[10:45:10] people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	acresearch	[10:45:12] makes sense?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	buster	[10:45:16] the image of a in the quotient
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:45:25] oh nvm I'm an idiot
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:45:30] I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:46:52] also what buster said
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:46:54] acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:47:29] oh, the mean of the mean...
2021-07-17 19:43:51	acresearch	[10:47:38] tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:47:39] then not
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:49:05] acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:50:03] if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Inline	[10:50:27] if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:50:28] Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Inline	[10:51:45] as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:52:30] C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Inline	[10:52:36] i.e. the means just add
2021-07-17 19:43:51	acresearch	[10:52:47] tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:53:07] tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:53:29] if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:53:39] and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-17 19:43:51	buster	[10:54:06] acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	acresearch	[10:54:28] buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:54:51] oh
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:55:00] tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:55:10] Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:55:19] tempate: no f is a ring hom
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:55:24] ok
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:55:34] it sends polynomials to polynomials
2021-07-17 19:43:51	buster	[10:55:40] one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:55:53] tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:56:38] so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:57:09] (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:57:15] yes, it does make sense
2021-07-17 19:43:51	buster	[10:57:41] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:58:04] if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[10:58:35] my naive self is having trouble thinking about the kernel of such a homomorphism. how's it not just (0, 0, 0) ?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[10:58:58] tempate: remember that C[x,y,z] is a ring of polynomials
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Inline	[10:59:36] or x_[1]/3 if you are taking that kind of mean
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:00:08] so elements in there looks like _ 1+ _x + _y + _z + _x^2 + _xy + _xz + _yz + _y^2 + _z^2 + ...
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:00:44] where the underlines are just C-coefficients.. I thought using a,b,c, etc for them was confusing and a1 etc are not super intuitive either
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:01:00] _ works
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:01:07] ok, I see
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Inline	[11:01:10] per pure count or per ratio, for ratio you can't take (a+b)/(a+b) for instance that would be (a+b)/2 rather
2021-07-17 19:43:51	buster	[11:01:29] oops, that's covariance. the variance one (Welford's) is further up the article
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:02:18] I'm having trouble understanding it because I don't see how f(x) = t is ever going to be zero (given that x is not 0) regardless of what y and z are
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:02:59] tempate: f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:03:08] since f is a ring homomorphism
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:03:40] oh
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:03:47] (well implicitly I also assumed its a C-algebra homomorphism... just means any complex number constants can be pulled outside of the function freely.. f(2x) = 2f(x))
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:04:08] tempate: so with that example that's 3w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:04:20] tempate: have you had a course in abstract algebra?)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:04:39] Fangs: yes, about a year ago
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:04:55] yeah time is a rough thing
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:05:08] :^)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:05:32] hello
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:05:58] with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w ?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:05:59] I can't do any analysis, at all.. you might be able to do this in less than a day: a convex function f: (a,b) -> R is continuous on (a,b)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	zacts	[11:06:00] hello
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:06:10] anyone can rec a book which teaches shannons information theorems?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:06:17] which is afforadble..
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:06:25] tempate: no, "I defined" f(x) = t, f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:06:50] riv: physical book? or pdf?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:06:57] riv: I read https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23057894-information-theory?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=67Ko2IllS2&rank=8 which was decently good
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:07:22] riv: I will send you a pdf of a book if you can tell me what it is (I'll look on libgen)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:07:42] i have PDFs
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:07:42] riv: if its a physical book try abebooks for 2nd hand books
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:07:49] my problem is that I want a real book
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:07:54] and the book I actually like is 90 quid :(
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:08:02] i will check abe books ty
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:08:03] riv: 2ndhand?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:08:06] riv: it's not a purely technical book (I don't recall there being any proofs) but it did a good job of giving an intuitive idea of the theorems
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:08:12] yes happy second hand
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:08:17] i wish I could borrow from a library too
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:08:18] kk
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:08:26] i can't even go in the local uni for reference anymore :/
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:08:32] riv: are you affiliated with a uni?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:08:34] no
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:08:44] but i have a reference card
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:08:48] why can't you go to the local uni?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:08:53] student account? can you use the uni library? they usually have inter-library loan
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:08:54] which does nothing now because the virus
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:08:58] ahhhh
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:09:06] yeah ok that's fair.. I forgot the virus is still a thing
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 19:43:51	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-17 19:43:51	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-17 19:43:51	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-17 19:43:51	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-17 19:43:51	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-17 19:43:51	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-17 19:43:51	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-17 19:43:51	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-17 19:43:51	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-17 19:43:51	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-17 19:43:51	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-17 19:43:51	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-17 19:43:51	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-17 19:43:51	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-17 19:43:51	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-17 19:43:51	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-17 19:43:52	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-17 19:43:52	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-17 19:43:52	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-17 19:43:52	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-17 19:43:52	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-17 19:43:52	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-17 19:43:52	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-17 19:43:52	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-17 19:43:52	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-17 19:43:52	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-17 19:43:52	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-17 19:43:52	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-17 19:43:52	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.

2021-07-17 21:48:14	Z-module	Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.

2021-07-17 22:21:17	buster	Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)

2021-07-17 22:22:10	cherim_	SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK

2021-07-17 22:32:17	cherim_	You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-17 22:32:49	Z-module	B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.

2021-07-17 23:20:32	taeaad	So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.

2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[04:40:06] yes, exactly
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[04:40:12] ok, so I need to solve it numerically
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:40:17] but you could probably do something with Lambert-W functions or something
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:42:10] (this is unrelated, but isn't what cokernel_hacker want is to solve the equation in terms of y?)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:43:04] well that's trivial
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:13] I want x s.t. tanh(x)/x=1/2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:42] there are two solutions which are approximately -1.91501 and 1.91501
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:43:58] I've forgotten most math terms. I thought what's trivial is to solve y in terms of x
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:44:05] (you just plug in x into tanh(x) and divide it by x)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[04:44:07] I wanted an analytical solution :)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:44:32] Fangs: oh sorry yeah i misunderstood
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[04:46:24] sorry if I am not understanding, is there an easy solution to my query?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:48:32] numerically you can use the Newton-Raphson algorithm, which should be pretty straightforward
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:49:08] but if you want a closed form expression for x in terms of y, you're out of luck i think. at least WA can't find an elementary inverse
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:49:25] if you're willing to use 'special functions
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:49:54] e(x) - e(-x)/(e(x) + e(-x))= x/2  ---> 2[e(2x) - 1] = x[e(2x) +1] --> 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:50:06] *'special functions' then you may or may not be able to get a formula, depending on which special functions you accept
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:51:49] supposing x > 0, 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2 -> 2e(2x) - e(log(x)) e(2x) - e(log(x)) = 2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:52:23] I don't think there's a way to factor out the x's so you can just take the log of both sides can you?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TOB_CyxoB	[04:53:20] cokernel_hacker, just plugged it in into maxima: x=log(-sqrt(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))) ; x=log(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))/2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:53:25] as a rule of thumb, things that mix exponentials with polynomials of x won't have elementary inverses unless there's some "obvious" simplification
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:53:35] i don't have a proof of this
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:53:44] but it usually ends up being the case
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:54:01] that's believable, and I didn't think you'd be able to solve it. I just wanted to try anyway and see where the difficulty is
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:54:15] (*I didn't think I'd be able to solve it, more precisely)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[04:55:34] TOB_CyxoB: that looked promising but using y=1/2 seems to give me something different from the numerical solution
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:57:00] i think they solved for tanh(x) = y
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:57:18] since I'm bored, can we do calculus for this?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:57:36] so we're basically solving for the difference between two functions tanh(x) - 2x = 0
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:17] cokernel_hacker, x=0.54931 (exp(x*2)-1)/(exp(x*2)+1)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[04:58:17] we want to minimize this, naively, but 0 might not be minimum.. so idk.. (tanh(x) - 2x)^2 insead
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[04:58:20] with calculus you could prove things like "there are exactly n solutions for y in some subset"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:46] cokernel_hacker, seems to produce 1/2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TOB_CyxoB	[04:59:46] cokernel_hacker, the other one is comples as in: 0.54931 + 3.14159i
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:00] TOB_CyxoB: d'oh
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:09] indeed, tanh(log(-.5/(.5-1)-1/(.5-1))/2) is 1/2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TOB_CyxoB	[05:00:51] *complex
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[05:00:52] 2 (-2 + sech^2(x)) (-2 x + tanh(x)) = 0
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[05:01:00] dude12312414: this is so much less tracable
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[05:01:02] was the original question to solve tanh(x)/x = y or tanh(x) = y?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[05:01:03] its cursed
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cokernel_hacker	[05:01:10] tanh(x)/x = y
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[05:01:18] ok
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TOB_CyxoB	[05:01:50] Oh... sorry
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:36] dear maxima managed to reduce it to x=(%e^(2*x)-1)/(%e^(2*x)*y+y)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:57] I guess than Newton comes in...
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[05:03:49] actually nvm.. -2 + sech^2(x) is never zero.. so that equation is only zero when (-2 x + tanh(x)) , which is the original problem..
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[05:10:47] uh
2021-07-17 23:35:18	dude12312414	[05:11:08] oh yeah nevermind
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[07:25:51] buster: you're a math physics-leaning guy right?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[07:26:04] buster: how much connection are there between discrete mathematics and math physics?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[07:52:07] I am a theoretical physicist, my favorite phys/math/CS area is enumerative combinatorics, and I am not ready to give a definite answer
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[07:52:31] I guess I'll join the group waiting for buster's answer
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[07:53:04] which area of physics?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[07:53:46] Statistical physics / condensed matter
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[07:56:31] We have Rogers-Ramanujan identities in stat.phys. :)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[07:58:16] cherim_: do you know anything about operation research?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[07:58:41] if you're in charge of a maths dept, would you rather tack the discrete math folks with the math physics people? or the operation research people?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[09:45:22] hello
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[09:51:03] an interpolating function for infinitely many points, infinitely differentiable (eventually to a constant), not necessarily differentiable everywhere. The function is expected to take "minimum energy state", that is, without little monsters like sin(x) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#/media/File:Gamma_plus_sin_pi_z.svg
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[09:51:03] Do you know of such a function/method?  It's not a quation I know the answer for.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:02:20] TheWild: I believe every polynomial is infinitely differentiable
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:03:09] What's the standard approach to prove that an algebraic set is irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:04:11] In particular, I have to show that {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k} is a variety.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:05:50] So I thought I'd first show that it's an algebraic set and then I would show that it's irreducible. I believe it's an algebraic set because it's the zeros of f(x, y, z) = x^3 + xy - 2z
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[10:06:29] the problem with polynomials is that for infinitely many points the... they just do not seem to work in practice because of mindbogglingly huge numbers.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[10:06:57] or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:13:28] tempate: what about (0,1,0)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:13:37] is that a zero of your polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:17:47] Fangs: I guess it is
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:18:21] tempate: your 'space' is included in the zero of your polynomial, but its not equal to
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:18:28] Fangs: maybe f(x, y, z) = x^3 + sqrt(y^3) - 2z is better?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:18:29] so its not the zeros of your polynomial
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:18:38] that's not apolynomial
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:18:59] Hmmm
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:19:05] tempate: I recall having this conversation before, didn't I gave your variety as the zero of two polynomials?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:19:27] tempate: let's... not get too fancy. lets take the real line in R^3
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:19:40] the real line (t,0,0), t in R
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:19:50] tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:20:10] Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:20:19] (can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:20:40] tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:21:31] tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:21:36] I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:22:04] just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:22:15] Yeah, right
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:22:47] so... V(y, z) ?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:22:54] tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:23:10] and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[10:23:10] Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[10:23:10] hmm... interesting. Let's put it into formula and check how it looks like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:23:19] Yes, I am
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:23:33] TheWild: I'm sorry but I wasn't answering your question. I don't really know anything about interpolation
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[10:23:51] anyway, it gave me some idea
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:24:21] tempate: here's a heuristics.. I think this is a 'safe' heuristics for algebraic sets over R and C, but when you get over more exotic rings you might want to ask someone more qualified
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:24:43] fair enough
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:24:47] tempate: a k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space will have to be described by (n-k) polynomials
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:25:37] or I guess (n-k) polynomials describes a k dimensional object in R^n or C^n
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:25:49] ok
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:26:05] its a heuristic in the sense that there are singularities, and ofc degenerate cases like (x^2+y^2 = 0) doesnt describe a surface in R^2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:26:09] so we could have V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) for our original problem?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:26:12] (in R^3 sorry)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:26:35] tempate: you might want to check, show that you dont end up with extra points, and all points are included
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:27:04] how can I make sure that no extra points are included though?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:28:38] it's fairly clear here that y must be x^2 and z must be x^3
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:28:53]  ok.. I don't know the fancy alg geom stuff, I can only work with ideals where the elements are functions on the space itself.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:29:28] tempate: but I thought this statement is true: if x is a pt in V(p1,...,pn) then p1(x) = 0, ..., pn(x) = 0
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:29:47] yes, that's correct
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:29:49] (I thought thats how you define V(I)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:29:51] (I thought thats how you define V(I))
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:30:25] tempate: so let p be a point in V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , and show that p is in {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k}
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:30:43] this ammount to finding t such that p = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:31:15] (tempate also if you can't tell I'm a bit aprehensive about alg geom lol)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:31:26] heh, yeah, don't worry
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:31:31] TheWild: did your idea work?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:31:31] you're helping me a lot
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:32:23] In any case, say that V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) works for our case. How would I show that it's irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:32:49] this would be an area where you're probably more qualified to answer than I am
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[10:32:57] actually I'm bugged by other dude... but I'm going to check that out
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:33:13] tempate: but I thought for certain rings, irreducible <-> prime ideal (or some other condition on the ideal?)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	 *	tempate [10:33:33] checks his notes
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:33:49] tempate: the name of the game is to translate geometric description into a statement about the corresponding ideal/or the quotient ring
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:34:27] tempate: which book are you reading? I might join in lol
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:35:03] Yeah, it's a corollary from Hilbert's Nullstellenstaz apparently: if I is a prime ideal, V(I) is irreducible.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:35:32] (I think it goes both ways but I'm not sure)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[10:35:37] Fangs, cherim_, great question! no idea
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:35:43] Fangs: Algebraic Curves by Fulton
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:36:06] Fangs: I'm in the second chapter now, so you're by no means late to the party
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:36:22] oh thats a commonly recommended one, and its not hearthsorne
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:36:43] *hartshorne
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:37:20] it'd be great for you to join, but no pressure
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:38:32] so the plan now is to show that it's a prime ideal, eh
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:38:47] oh 1.3 even
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:39:10] tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:39:24] or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:39:43] I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:39:55] yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:40:15] I believe you also have to throw in I != R
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:40:29] yeah
2021-07-17 23:35:18	TheWild	[10:42:09] Fangs: this gonna get funny if I somewhat end up with sinc :D
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:42:55] do you know what a (with a dash hovering over it) is supposed to stand for?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:43:27] as here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2154432/show-that-the-ideal-is-prime
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:44:57] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ApDGvm6e/img.jpg
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:45:03] tempate: I don't really see any dash
2021-07-17 23:35:18	acresearch	[10:45:10] people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	acresearch	[10:45:12] makes sense?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[10:45:16] the image of a in the quotient
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:45:25] oh nvm I'm an idiot
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:45:30] I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:46:52] also what buster said
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:46:54] acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:47:29] oh, the mean of the mean...
2021-07-17 23:35:18	acresearch	[10:47:38] tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:47:39] then not
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:49:05] acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:50:03] if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[10:50:27] if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:50:28] Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[10:51:45] as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:52:30] C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[10:52:36] i.e. the means just add
2021-07-17 23:35:18	acresearch	[10:52:47] tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:53:07] tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:53:29] if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:53:39] and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[10:54:06] acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	acresearch	[10:54:28] buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:54:51] oh
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:55:00] tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:55:10] Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:55:19] tempate: no f is a ring hom
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:55:24] ok
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:55:34] it sends polynomials to polynomials
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[10:55:40] one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:55:53] tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:56:38] so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:57:09] (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:57:15] yes, it does make sense
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[10:57:41] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:58:04] if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[10:58:35] my naive self is having trouble thinking about the kernel of such a homomorphism. how's it not just (0, 0, 0) ?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[10:58:58] tempate: remember that C[x,y,z] is a ring of polynomials
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[10:59:36] or x_[1]/3 if you are taking that kind of mean
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:00:08] so elements in there looks like _ 1+ _x + _y + _z + _x^2 + _xy + _xz + _yz + _y^2 + _z^2 + ...
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:00:44] where the underlines are just C-coefficients.. I thought using a,b,c, etc for them was confusing and a1 etc are not super intuitive either
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:01:00] _ works
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:01:07] ok, I see
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[11:01:10] per pure count or per ratio, for ratio you can't take (a+b)/(a+b) for instance that would be (a+b)/2 rather
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[11:01:29] oops, that's covariance. the variance one (Welford's) is further up the article
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:02:18] I'm having trouble understanding it because I don't see how f(x) = t is ever going to be zero (given that x is not 0) regardless of what y and z are
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:02:59] tempate: f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:03:08] since f is a ring homomorphism
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:03:40] oh
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:03:47] (well implicitly I also assumed its a C-algebra homomorphism... just means any complex number constants can be pulled outside of the function freely.. f(2x) = 2f(x))
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:04:08] tempate: so with that example that's 3w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:04:20] tempate: have you had a course in abstract algebra?)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:04:39] Fangs: yes, about a year ago
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:04:55] yeah time is a rough thing
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:05:08] :^)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:05:32] hello
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:05:58] with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w ?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:05:59] I can't do any analysis, at all.. you might be able to do this in less than a day: a convex function f: (a,b) -> R is continuous on (a,b)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	zacts	[11:06:00] hello
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:06:10] anyone can rec a book which teaches shannons information theorems?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:06:17] which is afforadble..
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:06:25] tempate: no, "I defined" f(x) = t, f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:06:50] riv: physical book? or pdf?

2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:07:42] i have PDFs
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:07:42] riv: if its a physical book try abebooks for 2nd hand books
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:07:49] my problem is that I want a real book
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:07:54] and the book I actually like is 90 quid :(
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:08:02] i will check abe books ty
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:08:03] riv: 2ndhand?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:08:06] riv: it's not a purely technical book (I don't recall there being any proofs) but it did a good job of giving an intuitive idea of the theorems
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:08:12] yes happy second hand
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:08:17] i wish I could borrow from a library too
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:08:18] kk
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:08:26] i can't even go in the local uni for reference anymore :/
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:08:32] riv: are you affiliated with a uni?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:08:34] no
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:08:44] but i have a reference card
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:08:48] why can't you go to the local uni?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:08:53] student account? can you use the uni library? they usually have inter-library loan
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:08:54] which does nothing now because the virus
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:08:58] ahhhh
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:09:06] yeah ok that's fair.. I forgot the virus is still a thing
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-17 23:35:18	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-17 23:35:18	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-17 23:35:18	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-17 23:35:18	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-17 23:35:18	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-17 23:35:18	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-17 23:35:18	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-17 23:35:18	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-17 23:35:18	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:35:18	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-17 23:35:18	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-17 23:35:18	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-17 23:35:18	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-17 23:35:18	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-17 23:35:18	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-17 23:35:18	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-17 23:35:18	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-17 23:35:18	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-17 23:35:18	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-17 23:35:18	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-17 23:35:18	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-17 23:35:18	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-17 23:35:18	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-17 23:35:18	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-17 23:35:18	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-17 23:35:18	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-17 23:35:18	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-17 23:35:18	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-17 23:35:18	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[17:47:22] particle-wave duality
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[17:47:23] lol
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	taeaad	[17:58:10] *thought
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[18:03:38] why unify ?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics

2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:42:10] (this is unrelated, but isn't what cokernel_hacker want is to solve the equation in terms of y?)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:43:04] well that's trivial
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:13] I want x s.t. tanh(x)/x=1/2
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cokernel_hacker	[04:43:42] there are two solutions which are approximately -1.91501 and 1.91501
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:43:58] I've forgotten most math terms. I thought what's trivial is to solve y in terms of x
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:44:05] (you just plug in x into tanh(x) and divide it by x)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cokernel_hacker	[04:44:07] I wanted an analytical solution :)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:44:32] Fangs: oh sorry yeah i misunderstood
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cokernel_hacker	[04:46:24] sorry if I am not understanding, is there an easy solution to my query?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:48:32] numerically you can use the Newton-Raphson algorithm, which should be pretty straightforward
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:49:08] but if you want a closed form expression for x in terms of y, you're out of luck i think. at least WA can't find an elementary inverse
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:49:25] if you're willing to use 'special functions
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:49:54] e(x) - e(-x)/(e(x) + e(-x))= x/2  ---> 2[e(2x) - 1] = x[e(2x) +1] --> 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:50:06] *'special functions' then you may or may not be able to get a formula, depending on which special functions you accept
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:51:49] supposing x > 0, 2e(2x) - xe(2x)  - x = 2 -> 2e(2x) - e(log(x)) e(2x) - e(log(x)) = 2
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:52:23] I don't think there's a way to factor out the x's so you can just take the log of both sides can you?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TOB_CyxoB	[04:53:20] cokernel_hacker, just plugged it in into maxima: x=log(-sqrt(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))) ; x=log(-y/(y-1)-1/(y-1))/2
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:53:25] as a rule of thumb, things that mix exponentials with polynomials of x won't have elementary inverses unless there's some "obvious" simplification
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:53:35] i don't have a proof of this
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:53:44] but it usually ends up being the case
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:54:01] that's believable, and I didn't think you'd be able to solve it. I just wanted to try anyway and see where the difficulty is
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:54:15] (*I didn't think I'd be able to solve it, more precisely)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cokernel_hacker	[04:55:34] TOB_CyxoB: that looked promising but using y=1/2 seems to give me something different from the numerical solution
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:57:00] i think they solved for tanh(x) = y
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:57:18] since I'm bored, can we do calculus for this?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:57:36] so we're basically solving for the difference between two functions tanh(x) - 2x = 0
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:17] cokernel_hacker, x=0.54931 (exp(x*2)-1)/(exp(x*2)+1)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[04:58:17] we want to minimize this, naively, but 0 might not be minimum.. so idk.. (tanh(x) - 2x)^2 insead
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[04:58:20] with calculus you could prove things like "there are exactly n solutions for y in some subset"
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TOB_CyxoB	[04:58:46] cokernel_hacker, seems to produce 1/2
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TOB_CyxoB	[04:59:46] cokernel_hacker, the other one is comples as in: 0.54931 + 3.14159i
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:00] TOB_CyxoB: d'oh
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cokernel_hacker	[05:00:09] indeed, tanh(log(-.5/(.5-1)-1/(.5-1))/2) is 1/2
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TOB_CyxoB	[05:00:51] *complex
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[05:00:52] 2 (-2 + sech^2(x)) (-2 x + tanh(x)) = 0
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[05:01:00] dude12312414: this is so much less tracable
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[05:01:02] was the original question to solve tanh(x)/x = y or tanh(x) = y?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[05:01:03] its cursed
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cokernel_hacker	[05:01:10] tanh(x)/x = y
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[05:01:18] ok
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TOB_CyxoB	[05:01:50] Oh... sorry
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:36] dear maxima managed to reduce it to x=(%e^(2*x)-1)/(%e^(2*x)*y+y)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TOB_CyxoB	[05:02:57] I guess than Newton comes in...
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[05:03:49] actually nvm.. -2 + sech^2(x) is never zero.. so that equation is only zero when (-2 x + tanh(x)) , which is the original problem..
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[05:10:47] uh
2021-07-17 23:37:26	dude12312414	[05:11:08] oh yeah nevermind
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[07:25:51] buster: you're a math physics-leaning guy right?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[07:26:04] buster: how much connection are there between discrete mathematics and math physics?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[07:52:07] I am a theoretical physicist, my favorite phys/math/CS area is enumerative combinatorics, and I am not ready to give a definite answer
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[07:52:31] I guess I'll join the group waiting for buster's answer
2021-07-17 23:37:26	riv	[07:53:04] which area of physics?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[07:53:46] Statistical physics / condensed matter
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[07:56:31] We have Rogers-Ramanujan identities in stat.phys. :)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[07:58:16] cherim_: do you know anything about operation research?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[07:58:41] if you're in charge of a maths dept, would you rather tack the discrete math folks with the math physics people? or the operation research people?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-17 23:37:26	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[09:45:22] hello
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[09:51:03] an interpolating function for infinitely many points, infinitely differentiable (eventually to a constant), not necessarily differentiable everywhere. The function is expected to take "minimum energy state", that is, without little monsters like sin(x) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#/media/File:Gamma_plus_sin_pi_z.svg
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[09:51:03] Do you know of such a function/method?  It's not a quation I know the answer for.
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:02:20] TheWild: I believe every polynomial is infinitely differentiable
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:03:09] What's the standard approach to prove that an algebraic set is irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:04:11] In particular, I have to show that {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k} is a variety.
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:05:50] So I thought I'd first show that it's an algebraic set and then I would show that it's irreducible. I believe it's an algebraic set because it's the zeros of f(x, y, z) = x^3 + xy - 2z
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[10:06:29] the problem with polynomials is that for infinitely many points the... they just do not seem to work in practice because of mindbogglingly huge numbers.
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[10:06:57] or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:13:28] tempate: what about (0,1,0)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:13:37] is that a zero of your polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:17:47] Fangs: I guess it is
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:18:21] tempate: your 'space' is included in the zero of your polynomial, but its not equal to
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:18:28] Fangs: maybe f(x, y, z) = x^3 + sqrt(y^3) - 2z is better?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:18:29] so its not the zeros of your polynomial
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:18:38] that's not apolynomial
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:18:59] Hmmm
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:19:05] tempate: I recall having this conversation before, didn't I gave your variety as the zero of two polynomials?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:19:27] tempate: let's... not get too fancy. lets take the real line in R^3
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:19:40] the real line (t,0,0), t in R
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:19:50] tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:20:10] Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:20:19] (can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:20:40] tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:21:31] tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:21:36] I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:22:04] just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:22:15] Yeah, right
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:22:47] so... V(y, z) ?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:22:54] tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:23:10] and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[10:23:10] Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[10:23:10] hmm... interesting. Let's put it into formula and check how it looks like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:23:19] Yes, I am
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:23:33] TheWild: I'm sorry but I wasn't answering your question. I don't really know anything about interpolation
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[10:23:51] anyway, it gave me some idea
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:24:21] tempate: here's a heuristics.. I think this is a 'safe' heuristics for algebraic sets over R and C, but when you get over more exotic rings you might want to ask someone more qualified
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:24:43] fair enough
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:24:47] tempate: a k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space will have to be described by (n-k) polynomials
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:25:37] or I guess (n-k) polynomials describes a k dimensional object in R^n or C^n
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:25:49] ok
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:26:05] its a heuristic in the sense that there are singularities, and ofc degenerate cases like (x^2+y^2 = 0) doesnt describe a surface in R^2
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:26:09] so we could have V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) for our original problem?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:26:12] (in R^3 sorry)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:26:35] tempate: you might want to check, show that you dont end up with extra points, and all points are included
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:27:04] how can I make sure that no extra points are included though?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:28:38] it's fairly clear here that y must be x^2 and z must be x^3
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:28:53]  ok.. I don't know the fancy alg geom stuff, I can only work with ideals where the elements are functions on the space itself.
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:29:28] tempate: but I thought this statement is true: if x is a pt in V(p1,...,pn) then p1(x) = 0, ..., pn(x) = 0
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:29:47] yes, that's correct
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:29:49] (I thought thats how you define V(I)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:29:51] (I thought thats how you define V(I))
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:30:25] tempate: so let p be a point in V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , and show that p is in {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k}
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:30:43] this ammount to finding t such that p = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:31:15] (tempate also if you can't tell I'm a bit aprehensive about alg geom lol)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:31:26] heh, yeah, don't worry
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:31:31] TheWild: did your idea work?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:31:31] you're helping me a lot
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:32:23] In any case, say that V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) works for our case. How would I show that it's irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:32:49] this would be an area where you're probably more qualified to answer than I am
2021-07-17 23:37:26	TheWild	[10:32:57] actually I'm bugged by other dude... but I'm going to check that out
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:33:13] tempate: but I thought for certain rings, irreducible <-> prime ideal (or some other condition on the ideal?)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	 *	tempate [10:33:33] checks his notes
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:33:49] tempate: the name of the game is to translate geometric description into a statement about the corresponding ideal/or the quotient ring
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:34:27] tempate: which book are you reading? I might join in lol
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:35:03] Yeah, it's a corollary from Hilbert's Nullstellenstaz apparently: if I is a prime ideal, V(I) is irreducible.
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:35:32] (I think it goes both ways but I'm not sure)
2021-07-17 23:37:26	buster	[10:35:37] Fangs, cherim_, great question! no idea
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:35:43] Fangs: Algebraic Curves by Fulton
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:36:06] Fangs: I'm in the second chapter now, so you're by no means late to the party
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:36:22] oh thats a commonly recommended one, and its not hearthsorne
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:36:43] *hartshorne
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:37:20] it'd be great for you to join, but no pressure
2021-07-17 23:37:26	tempate	[10:38:32] so the plan now is to show that it's a prime ideal, eh
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:38:47] oh 1.3 even
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:39:10] tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-17 23:37:26	Fangs	[10:39:24] or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:39:43] I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:39:55] yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:40:15] I believe you also have to throw in I != R
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:40:29] yeah
2021-07-17 23:37:27	TheWild	[10:42:09] Fangs: this gonna get funny if I somewhat end up with sinc :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:42:55] do you know what a (with a dash hovering over it) is supposed to stand for?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:43:27] as here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2154432/show-that-the-ideal-is-prime
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:44:57] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ApDGvm6e/img.jpg
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:45:03] tempate: I don't really see any dash
2021-07-17 23:37:27	acresearch	[10:45:10] people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	acresearch	[10:45:12] makes sense?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[10:45:16] the image of a in the quotient
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:45:25] oh nvm I'm an idiot
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:45:30] I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:46:52] also what buster said
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:46:54] acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:47:29] oh, the mean of the mean...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	acresearch	[10:47:38] tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:47:39] then not
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:49:05] acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:50:03] if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[10:50:27] if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:50:28] Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[10:51:45] as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:52:30] C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[10:52:36] i.e. the means just add
2021-07-17 23:37:27	acresearch	[10:52:47] tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:53:07] tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:53:29] if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:53:39] and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[10:54:06] acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	acresearch	[10:54:28] buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:54:51] oh
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:55:00] tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:55:10] Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:55:19] tempate: no f is a ring hom
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:55:24] ok
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:55:34] it sends polynomials to polynomials
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[10:55:40] one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:55:53] tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:56:38] so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:57:09] (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:57:15] yes, it does make sense
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[10:57:41] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:58:04] if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[10:58:35] my naive self is having trouble thinking about the kernel of such a homomorphism. how's it not just (0, 0, 0) ?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[10:58:58] tempate: remember that C[x,y,z] is a ring of polynomials
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[10:59:36] or x_[1]/3 if you are taking that kind of mean
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:00:08] so elements in there looks like _ 1+ _x + _y + _z + _x^2 + _xy + _xz + _yz + _y^2 + _z^2 + ...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:00:44] where the underlines are just C-coefficients.. I thought using a,b,c, etc for them was confusing and a1 etc are not super intuitive either
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:01:00] _ works
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:01:07] ok, I see
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[11:01:10] per pure count or per ratio, for ratio you can't take (a+b)/(a+b) for instance that would be (a+b)/2 rather
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[11:01:29] oops, that's covariance. the variance one (Welford's) is further up the article
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:02:18] I'm having trouble understanding it because I don't see how f(x) = t is ever going to be zero (given that x is not 0) regardless of what y and z are
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:02:59] tempate: f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:03:08] since f is a ring homomorphism
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:03:40] oh
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:03:47] (well implicitly I also assumed its a C-algebra homomorphism... just means any complex number constants can be pulled outside of the function freely.. f(2x) = 2f(x))
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:04:08] tempate: so with that example that's 3w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:04:20] tempate: have you had a course in abstract algebra?)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:04:39] Fangs: yes, about a year ago
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:04:55] yeah time is a rough thing
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:05:08] :^)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:05:32] hello
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:05:58] with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w ?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:05:59] I can't do any analysis, at all.. you might be able to do this in less than a day: a convex function f: (a,b) -> R is continuous on (a,b)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	zacts	[11:06:00] hello
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:06:10] anyone can rec a book which teaches shannons information theorems?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:06:17] which is afforadble..
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:06:25] tempate: no, "I defined" f(x) = t, f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:06:50] riv: physical book? or pdf?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:06:57] riv: I read https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23057894-information-theory?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=67Ko2IllS2&rank=8 which was decently good
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:07:22] riv: I will send you a pdf of a book if you can tell me what it is (I'll look on libgen)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:07:42] i have PDFs
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:07:42] riv: if its a physical book try abebooks for 2nd hand books
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:07:49] my problem is that I want a real book
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:07:54] and the book I actually like is 90 quid :(
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:08:02] i will check abe books ty
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:08:03] riv: 2ndhand?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:08:06] riv: it's not a purely technical book (I don't recall there being any proofs) but it did a good job of giving an intuitive idea of the theorems
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:08:12] yes happy second hand
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:08:17] i wish I could borrow from a library too
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:08:18] kk
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:08:26] i can't even go in the local uni for reference anymore :/
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:08:32] riv: are you affiliated with a uni?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:08:34] no
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:08:44] but i have a reference card
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:08:48] why can't you go to the local uni?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:08:53] student account? can you use the uni library? they usually have inter-library loan
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:08:54] which does nothing now because the virus
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:08:58] ahhhh
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:09:06] yeah ok that's fair.. I forgot the virus is still a thing
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:37:27	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-17 23:37:27	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-17 23:37:27	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-17 23:37:27	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-17 23:37:27	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-17 23:37:27	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-17 23:37:27	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-17 23:37:27	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-17 23:37:27	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-17 23:37:27	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:37:27	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-17 23:37:27	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-17 23:37:27	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-17 23:37:27	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-17 23:37:27	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-17 23:37:27	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-17 23:37:27	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-17 23:37:27	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-17 23:37:27	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-17 23:37:27	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-17 23:37:27	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-17 23:37:27	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-17 23:37:27	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-17 23:37:27	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-17 23:37:27	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-17 23:37:27	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-17 23:37:27	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-17 23:37:27	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[17:47:22] particle-wave duality
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[17:47:23] lol
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[17:58:10] *thought
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[18:03:38] why unify ?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible

2021-07-17 23:41:25	acresearch	people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-17 23:41:29	taeaad	Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-17 23:42:54	mornfall	acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-17 23:43:14	mornfall	acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-17 23:43:35	mornfall	acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-17 23:44:59	mornfall	acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list

2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[07:26:04] buster: how much connection are there between discrete mathematics and math physics?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[07:52:07] I am a theoretical physicist, my favorite phys/math/CS area is enumerative combinatorics, and I am not ready to give a definite answer
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[07:52:31] I guess I'll join the group waiting for buster's answer
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[07:53:04] which area of physics?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[07:53:46] Statistical physics / condensed matter
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[07:56:31] We have Rogers-Ramanujan identities in stat.phys. :)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[07:58:16] cherim_: do you know anything about operation research?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[07:58:41] if you're in charge of a maths dept, would you rather tack the discrete math folks with the math physics people? or the operation research people?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[09:45:22] hello
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[09:51:03] an interpolating function for infinitely many points, infinitely differentiable (eventually to a constant), not necessarily differentiable everywhere. The function is expected to take "minimum energy state", that is, without little monsters like sin(x) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#/media/File:Gamma_plus_sin_pi_z.svg
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[09:51:03] Do you know of such a function/method?  It's not a quation I know the answer for.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:02:20] TheWild: I believe every polynomial is infinitely differentiable
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:03:09] What's the standard approach to prove that an algebraic set is irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:04:11] In particular, I have to show that {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k} is a variety.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:05:50] So I thought I'd first show that it's an algebraic set and then I would show that it's irreducible. I believe it's an algebraic set because it's the zeros of f(x, y, z) = x^3 + xy - 2z
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[10:06:29] the problem with polynomials is that for infinitely many points the... they just do not seem to work in practice because of mindbogglingly huge numbers.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[10:06:57] or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:13:28] tempate: what about (0,1,0)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:13:37] is that a zero of your polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:17:47] Fangs: I guess it is
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:18:21] tempate: your 'space' is included in the zero of your polynomial, but its not equal to
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:18:28] Fangs: maybe f(x, y, z) = x^3 + sqrt(y^3) - 2z is better?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:18:29] so its not the zeros of your polynomial
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:18:38] that's not apolynomial
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:18:59] Hmmm
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:19:05] tempate: I recall having this conversation before, didn't I gave your variety as the zero of two polynomials?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:19:27] tempate: let's... not get too fancy. lets take the real line in R^3
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:19:40] the real line (t,0,0), t in R
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:19:50] tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:20:10] Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:20:19] (can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:20:40] tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:21:31] tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:21:36] I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:22:04] just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:22:15] Yeah, right
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:22:47] so... V(y, z) ?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:22:54] tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:23:10] and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[10:23:10] Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[10:23:10] hmm... interesting. Let's put it into formula and check how it looks like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:23:19] Yes, I am
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:23:33] TheWild: I'm sorry but I wasn't answering your question. I don't really know anything about interpolation
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[10:23:51] anyway, it gave me some idea
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:24:21] tempate: here's a heuristics.. I think this is a 'safe' heuristics for algebraic sets over R and C, but when you get over more exotic rings you might want to ask someone more qualified
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:24:43] fair enough
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:24:47] tempate: a k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space will have to be described by (n-k) polynomials
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:25:37] or I guess (n-k) polynomials describes a k dimensional object in R^n or C^n
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:25:49] ok
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:26:05] its a heuristic in the sense that there are singularities, and ofc degenerate cases like (x^2+y^2 = 0) doesnt describe a surface in R^2
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:26:09] so we could have V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) for our original problem?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:26:12] (in R^3 sorry)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:26:35] tempate: you might want to check, show that you dont end up with extra points, and all points are included
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:27:04] how can I make sure that no extra points are included though?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:28:38] it's fairly clear here that y must be x^2 and z must be x^3
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:28:53]  ok.. I don't know the fancy alg geom stuff, I can only work with ideals where the elements are functions on the space itself.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:29:28] tempate: but I thought this statement is true: if x is a pt in V(p1,...,pn) then p1(x) = 0, ..., pn(x) = 0
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:29:47] yes, that's correct
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:29:49] (I thought thats how you define V(I)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:29:51] (I thought thats how you define V(I))
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:30:25] tempate: so let p be a point in V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , and show that p is in {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k}
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:30:43] this ammount to finding t such that p = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:31:15] (tempate also if you can't tell I'm a bit aprehensive about alg geom lol)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:31:26] heh, yeah, don't worry
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:31:31] TheWild: did your idea work?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:31:31] you're helping me a lot
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:32:23] In any case, say that V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) works for our case. How would I show that it's irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:32:49] this would be an area where you're probably more qualified to answer than I am
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[10:32:57] actually I'm bugged by other dude... but I'm going to check that out
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:33:13] tempate: but I thought for certain rings, irreducible <-> prime ideal (or some other condition on the ideal?)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	 *	tempate [10:33:33] checks his notes
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:33:49] tempate: the name of the game is to translate geometric description into a statement about the corresponding ideal/or the quotient ring
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:34:27] tempate: which book are you reading? I might join in lol
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:35:03] Yeah, it's a corollary from Hilbert's Nullstellenstaz apparently: if I is a prime ideal, V(I) is irreducible.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:35:32] (I think it goes both ways but I'm not sure)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[10:35:37] Fangs, cherim_, great question! no idea
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:35:43] Fangs: Algebraic Curves by Fulton
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:36:06] Fangs: I'm in the second chapter now, so you're by no means late to the party
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:36:22] oh thats a commonly recommended one, and its not hearthsorne
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:36:43] *hartshorne
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:37:20] it'd be great for you to join, but no pressure
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:38:32] so the plan now is to show that it's a prime ideal, eh
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:38:47] oh 1.3 even
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:39:10] tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:39:24] or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:39:43] I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:39:55] yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:40:15] I believe you also have to throw in I != R
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:40:29] yeah
2021-07-17 23:53:30	TheWild	[10:42:09] Fangs: this gonna get funny if I somewhat end up with sinc :D
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:42:55] do you know what a (with a dash hovering over it) is supposed to stand for?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:43:27] as here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2154432/show-that-the-ideal-is-prime
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:44:57] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ApDGvm6e/img.jpg
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:45:03] tempate: I don't really see any dash
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[10:45:10] people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[10:45:12] makes sense?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[10:45:16] the image of a in the quotient
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:45:25] oh nvm I'm an idiot
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:45:30] I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:46:52] also what buster said
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:46:54] acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:47:29] oh, the mean of the mean...
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[10:47:38] tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:47:39] then not
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:49:05] acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:50:03] if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[10:50:27] if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:50:28] Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[10:51:45] as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:52:30] C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[10:52:36] i.e. the means just add
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[10:52:47] tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:53:07] tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:53:29] if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:53:39] and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[10:54:06] acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[10:54:28] buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:54:51] oh
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:55:00] tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:55:10] Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:55:19] tempate: no f is a ring hom
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:55:24] ok
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:55:34] it sends polynomials to polynomials
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[10:55:40] one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:55:53] tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:56:38] so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:57:09] (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:57:15] yes, it does make sense
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[10:57:41] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:58:04] if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[10:58:35] my naive self is having trouble thinking about the kernel of such a homomorphism. how's it not just (0, 0, 0) ?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[10:58:58] tempate: remember that C[x,y,z] is a ring of polynomials
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[10:59:36] or x_[1]/3 if you are taking that kind of mean
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:00:08] so elements in there looks like _ 1+ _x + _y + _z + _x^2 + _xy + _xz + _yz + _y^2 + _z^2 + ...
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:00:44] where the underlines are just C-coefficients.. I thought using a,b,c, etc for them was confusing and a1 etc are not super intuitive either
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:01:00] _ works
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:01:07] ok, I see
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[11:01:10] per pure count or per ratio, for ratio you can't take (a+b)/(a+b) for instance that would be (a+b)/2 rather
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[11:01:29] oops, that's covariance. the variance one (Welford's) is further up the article
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:02:18] I'm having trouble understanding it because I don't see how f(x) = t is ever going to be zero (given that x is not 0) regardless of what y and z are
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:02:59] tempate: f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:03:08] since f is a ring homomorphism
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:03:40] oh
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:03:47] (well implicitly I also assumed its a C-algebra homomorphism... just means any complex number constants can be pulled outside of the function freely.. f(2x) = 2f(x))
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:04:08] tempate: so with that example that's 3w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:04:20] tempate: have you had a course in abstract algebra?)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:04:39] Fangs: yes, about a year ago
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:04:55] yeah time is a rough thing
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:05:08] :^)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:05:32] hello
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:05:58] with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w ?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:05:59] I can't do any analysis, at all.. you might be able to do this in less than a day: a convex function f: (a,b) -> R is continuous on (a,b)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	zacts	[11:06:00] hello
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:06:10] anyone can rec a book which teaches shannons information theorems?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:06:17] which is afforadble..
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:06:25] tempate: no, "I defined" f(x) = t, f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:06:50] riv: physical book? or pdf?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:06:57] riv: I read https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23057894-information-theory?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=67Ko2IllS2&rank=8 which was decently good
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:07:22] riv: I will send you a pdf of a book if you can tell me what it is (I'll look on libgen)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:07:42] i have PDFs
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:07:42] riv: if its a physical book try abebooks for 2nd hand books
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:07:49] my problem is that I want a real book
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:07:54] and the book I actually like is 90 quid :(
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:08:02] i will check abe books ty
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:08:03] riv: 2ndhand?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:08:06] riv: it's not a purely technical book (I don't recall there being any proofs) but it did a good job of giving an intuitive idea of the theorems
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:08:12] yes happy second hand
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:08:17] i wish I could borrow from a library too
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:08:18] kk
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:08:26] i can't even go in the local uni for reference anymore :/
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:08:32] riv: are you affiliated with a uni?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:08:34] no
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:08:44] but i have a reference card
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:08:48] why can't you go to the local uni?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:08:53] student account? can you use the uni library? they usually have inter-library loan
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:08:54] which does nothing now because the virus
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:08:58] ahhhh
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:09:06] yeah ok that's fair.. I forgot the virus is still a thing
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:53:30	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-17 23:53:30	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-17 23:53:30	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-17 23:53:30	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-17 23:53:30	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-17 23:53:30	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-17 23:53:30	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-17 23:53:30	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-17 23:53:30	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-17 23:53:30	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:53:30	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-17 23:53:30	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-17 23:53:30	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-17 23:53:30	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-17 23:53:30	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-17 23:53:30	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-17 23:53:30	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-17 23:53:30	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-17 23:53:30	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-17 23:53:30	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-17 23:53:30	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-17 23:53:30	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-17 23:53:30	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-17 23:53:30	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-17 23:53:30	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-17 23:53:30	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[17:47:22] particle-wave duality
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[17:47:23] lol
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[17:58:10] *thought
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[18:03:38] why unify ?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[18:07:44] if the solution is in creating fiction with half working math (or none at all on close inspection) and danger of more confusion i'd rather stick to the mosaic
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[18:08:07] erm, sorry
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:08:09] it seems my ignore list is empty, so i don't quite understand what is going on
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Inline	[18:10:14] taeaad: that was not to you with your rock stuff
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[18:10:41] Oh, OK.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:11:25] people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	taeaad	[18:11:29] Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:12:54] acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-17 23:53:30	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-17 23:53:30	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-17 23:53:30	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors

2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[09:45:22] hello
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[09:51:03] an interpolating function for infinitely many points, infinitely differentiable (eventually to a constant), not necessarily differentiable everywhere. The function is expected to take "minimum energy state", that is, without little monsters like sin(x) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#/media/File:Gamma_plus_sin_pi_z.svg
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[09:51:03] Do you know of such a function/method?  It's not a quation I know the answer for.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:02:20] TheWild: I believe every polynomial is infinitely differentiable
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:03:09] What's the standard approach to prove that an algebraic set is irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:04:11] In particular, I have to show that {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k} is a variety.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:05:50] So I thought I'd first show that it's an algebraic set and then I would show that it's irreducible. I believe it's an algebraic set because it's the zeros of f(x, y, z) = x^3 + xy - 2z
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[10:06:29] the problem with polynomials is that for infinitely many points the... they just do not seem to work in practice because of mindbogglingly huge numbers.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[10:06:57] or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:13:28] tempate: what about (0,1,0)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:13:37] is that a zero of your polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:17:47] Fangs: I guess it is
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:18:21] tempate: your 'space' is included in the zero of your polynomial, but its not equal to
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:18:28] Fangs: maybe f(x, y, z) = x^3 + sqrt(y^3) - 2z is better?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:18:29] so its not the zeros of your polynomial
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:18:38] that's not apolynomial
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:18:59] Hmmm
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:19:05] tempate: I recall having this conversation before, didn't I gave your variety as the zero of two polynomials?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:19:27] tempate: let's... not get too fancy. lets take the real line in R^3
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:19:40] the real line (t,0,0), t in R
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:19:50] tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:20:10] Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:20:19] (can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:20:40] tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:21:31] tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:21:36] I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:22:04] just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:22:15] Yeah, right
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:22:47] so... V(y, z) ?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:22:54] tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:23:10] and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[10:23:10] Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[10:23:10] hmm... interesting. Let's put it into formula and check how it looks like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:23:19] Yes, I am
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:23:33] TheWild: I'm sorry but I wasn't answering your question. I don't really know anything about interpolation
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[10:23:51] anyway, it gave me some idea
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:24:21] tempate: here's a heuristics.. I think this is a 'safe' heuristics for algebraic sets over R and C, but when you get over more exotic rings you might want to ask someone more qualified
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:24:43] fair enough
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:24:47] tempate: a k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space will have to be described by (n-k) polynomials
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:25:37] or I guess (n-k) polynomials describes a k dimensional object in R^n or C^n
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:25:49] ok
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:26:05] its a heuristic in the sense that there are singularities, and ofc degenerate cases like (x^2+y^2 = 0) doesnt describe a surface in R^2
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:26:09] so we could have V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) for our original problem?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:26:12] (in R^3 sorry)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:26:35] tempate: you might want to check, show that you dont end up with extra points, and all points are included
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:27:04] how can I make sure that no extra points are included though?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:28:38] it's fairly clear here that y must be x^2 and z must be x^3
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:28:53]  ok.. I don't know the fancy alg geom stuff, I can only work with ideals where the elements are functions on the space itself.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:29:28] tempate: but I thought this statement is true: if x is a pt in V(p1,...,pn) then p1(x) = 0, ..., pn(x) = 0
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:29:47] yes, that's correct
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:29:49] (I thought thats how you define V(I)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:29:51] (I thought thats how you define V(I))
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:30:25] tempate: so let p be a point in V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , and show that p is in {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k}
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:30:43] this ammount to finding t such that p = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:31:15] (tempate also if you can't tell I'm a bit aprehensive about alg geom lol)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:31:26] heh, yeah, don't worry
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:31:31] TheWild: did your idea work?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:31:31] you're helping me a lot
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:32:23] In any case, say that V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) works for our case. How would I show that it's irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:32:49] this would be an area where you're probably more qualified to answer than I am
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[10:32:57] actually I'm bugged by other dude... but I'm going to check that out
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:33:13] tempate: but I thought for certain rings, irreducible <-> prime ideal (or some other condition on the ideal?)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	 *	tempate [10:33:33] checks his notes
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:33:49] tempate: the name of the game is to translate geometric description into a statement about the corresponding ideal/or the quotient ring
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:34:27] tempate: which book are you reading? I might join in lol
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:35:03] Yeah, it's a corollary from Hilbert's Nullstellenstaz apparently: if I is a prime ideal, V(I) is irreducible.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:35:32] (I think it goes both ways but I'm not sure)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[10:35:37] Fangs, cherim_, great question! no idea
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:35:43] Fangs: Algebraic Curves by Fulton
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:36:06] Fangs: I'm in the second chapter now, so you're by no means late to the party
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:36:22] oh thats a commonly recommended one, and its not hearthsorne
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:36:43] *hartshorne
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:37:20] it'd be great for you to join, but no pressure
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:38:32] so the plan now is to show that it's a prime ideal, eh
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:38:47] oh 1.3 even
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:39:10] tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:39:24] or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:39:43] I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:39:55] yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:40:15] I believe you also have to throw in I != R
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:40:29] yeah
2021-07-17 23:54:17	TheWild	[10:42:09] Fangs: this gonna get funny if I somewhat end up with sinc :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:42:55] do you know what a (with a dash hovering over it) is supposed to stand for?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:43:27] as here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2154432/show-that-the-ideal-is-prime
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:44:57] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ApDGvm6e/img.jpg
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:45:03] tempate: I don't really see any dash
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[10:45:10] people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[10:45:12] makes sense?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[10:45:16] the image of a in the quotient
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:45:25] oh nvm I'm an idiot
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:45:30] I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:46:52] also what buster said
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:46:54] acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:47:29] oh, the mean of the mean...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[10:47:38] tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:47:39] then not
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:49:05] acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:50:03] if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[10:50:27] if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:50:28] Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[10:51:45] as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:52:30] C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[10:52:36] i.e. the means just add
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[10:52:47] tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:53:07] tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:53:29] if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:53:39] and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[10:54:06] acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[10:54:28] buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:54:51] oh
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:55:00] tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:55:10] Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:55:19] tempate: no f is a ring hom
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:55:24] ok
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:55:34] it sends polynomials to polynomials
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[10:55:40] one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:55:53] tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:56:38] so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:57:09] (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:57:15] yes, it does make sense
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[10:57:41] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:58:04] if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[10:58:35] my naive self is having trouble thinking about the kernel of such a homomorphism. how's it not just (0, 0, 0) ?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[10:58:58] tempate: remember that C[x,y,z] is a ring of polynomials
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[10:59:36] or x_[1]/3 if you are taking that kind of mean
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:00:08] so elements in there looks like _ 1+ _x + _y + _z + _x^2 + _xy + _xz + _yz + _y^2 + _z^2 + ...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:00:44] where the underlines are just C-coefficients.. I thought using a,b,c, etc for them was confusing and a1 etc are not super intuitive either
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:01:00] _ works
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:01:07] ok, I see
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[11:01:10] per pure count or per ratio, for ratio you can't take (a+b)/(a+b) for instance that would be (a+b)/2 rather
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[11:01:29] oops, that's covariance. the variance one (Welford's) is further up the article
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:02:18] I'm having trouble understanding it because I don't see how f(x) = t is ever going to be zero (given that x is not 0) regardless of what y and z are
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:02:59] tempate: f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:03:08] since f is a ring homomorphism
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:03:40] oh
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:03:47] (well implicitly I also assumed its a C-algebra homomorphism... just means any complex number constants can be pulled outside of the function freely.. f(2x) = 2f(x))
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:04:08] tempate: so with that example that's 3w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:04:20] tempate: have you had a course in abstract algebra?)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:04:39] Fangs: yes, about a year ago
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:04:55] yeah time is a rough thing
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:05:08] :^)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:05:32] hello
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:05:58] with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w ?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:05:59] I can't do any analysis, at all.. you might be able to do this in less than a day: a convex function f: (a,b) -> R is continuous on (a,b)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	zacts	[11:06:00] hello
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:06:10] anyone can rec a book which teaches shannons information theorems?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:06:17] which is afforadble..
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:06:25] tempate: no, "I defined" f(x) = t, f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:06:50] riv: physical book? or pdf?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:06:57] riv: I read https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23057894-information-theory?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=67Ko2IllS2&rank=8 which was decently good
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:07:22] riv: I will send you a pdf of a book if you can tell me what it is (I'll look on libgen)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:07:42] i have PDFs
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:07:42] riv: if its a physical book try abebooks for 2nd hand books
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:07:49] my problem is that I want a real book
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:07:54] and the book I actually like is 90 quid :(
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:08:02] i will check abe books ty
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:08:03] riv: 2ndhand?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:08:06] riv: it's not a purely technical book (I don't recall there being any proofs) but it did a good job of giving an intuitive idea of the theorems
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:08:12] yes happy second hand
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:08:17] i wish I could borrow from a library too
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:08:18] kk
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:08:26] i can't even go in the local uni for reference anymore :/
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:08:32] riv: are you affiliated with a uni?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:08:34] no
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:08:44] but i have a reference card
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:08:48] why can't you go to the local uni?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:08:53] student account? can you use the uni library? they usually have inter-library loan
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:08:54] which does nothing now because the virus
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:08:58] ahhhh
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:09:06] yeah ok that's fair.. I forgot the virus is still a thing
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:54:17	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-17 23:54:17	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-17 23:54:17	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-17 23:54:17	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-17 23:54:17	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-17 23:54:17	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-17 23:54:17	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-17 23:54:17	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-17 23:54:17	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-17 23:54:17	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:54:17	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-17 23:54:17	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-17 23:54:17	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-17 23:54:17	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-17 23:54:17	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-17 23:54:17	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-17 23:54:17	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-17 23:54:17	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-17 23:54:17	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-17 23:54:17	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-17 23:54:17	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-17 23:54:17	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-17 23:54:17	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-17 23:54:17	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-17 23:54:17	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[17:47:22] particle-wave duality
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[17:47:23] lol
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[17:58:10] *thought
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[18:03:38] why unify ?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[18:07:44] if the solution is in creating fiction with half working math (or none at all on close inspection) and danger of more confusion i'd rather stick to the mosaic
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[18:08:07] erm, sorry
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:08:09] it seems my ignore list is empty, so i don't quite understand what is going on
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Inline	[18:10:14] taeaad: that was not to you with your rock stuff
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[18:10:41] Oh, OK.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:11:25] people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	taeaad	[18:11:29] Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:12:54] acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-17 23:54:17	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-17 23:54:17	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors
2021-07-17 23:54:17	int-e	[18:24:00] Z-module: (in addition to restricting to vertical planes)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Z-module	[18:24:10] anyway, it's neat how merely a well-ordering of R (or of R^3 or of all the circles in R^3, same thing) is what enables all of this, without having to use c = aleph_1. There are other types of magic constructions where you do need CH.

2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[07:52:31] I guess I'll join the group waiting for buster's answer
2021-07-17 23:58:53	riv	[07:53:04] which area of physics?
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[07:53:46] Statistical physics / condensed matter
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[07:56:31] We have Rogers-Ramanujan identities in stat.phys. :)
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[07:58:16] cherim_: do you know anything about operation research?
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[07:58:41] if you're in charge of a maths dept, would you rather tack the discrete math folks with the math physics people? or the operation research people?
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-17 23:58:53	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-17 23:58:53	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are
2021-07-17 23:58:53	TheWild	[09:45:22] hello
2021-07-17 23:58:53	TheWild	[09:51:03] an interpolating function for infinitely many points, infinitely differentiable (eventually to a constant), not necessarily differentiable everywhere. The function is expected to take "minimum energy state", that is, without little monsters like sin(x) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#/media/File:Gamma_plus_sin_pi_z.svg
2021-07-17 23:58:53	TheWild	[09:51:03] Do you know of such a function/method?  It's not a quation I know the answer for.
2021-07-17 23:58:53	tempate	[10:02:20] TheWild: I believe every polynomial is infinitely differentiable
2021-07-17 23:58:53	tempate	[10:03:09] What's the standard approach to prove that an algebraic set is irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:58:53	tempate	[10:04:11] In particular, I have to show that {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k} is a variety.
2021-07-17 23:58:53	tempate	[10:05:50] So I thought I'd first show that it's an algebraic set and then I would show that it's irreducible. I believe it's an algebraic set because it's the zeros of f(x, y, z) = x^3 + xy - 2z
2021-07-17 23:58:54	TheWild	[10:06:29] the problem with polynomials is that for infinitely many points the... they just do not seem to work in practice because of mindbogglingly huge numbers.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	TheWild	[10:06:57] or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:13:28] tempate: what about (0,1,0)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:13:37] is that a zero of your polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:17:47] Fangs: I guess it is
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:18:21] tempate: your 'space' is included in the zero of your polynomial, but its not equal to
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:18:28] Fangs: maybe f(x, y, z) = x^3 + sqrt(y^3) - 2z is better?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:18:29] so its not the zeros of your polynomial
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:18:38] that's not apolynomial
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:18:59] Hmmm
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:19:05] tempate: I recall having this conversation before, didn't I gave your variety as the zero of two polynomials?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:19:27] tempate: let's... not get too fancy. lets take the real line in R^3
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:19:40] the real line (t,0,0), t in R
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:19:50] tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:20:10] Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:20:19] (can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:20:40] tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:21:31] tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:21:36] I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:22:04] just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:22:15] Yeah, right
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:22:47] so... V(y, z) ?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:22:54] tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:23:10] and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
2021-07-17 23:58:54	TheWild	[10:23:10] Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	TheWild	[10:23:10] hmm... interesting. Let's put it into formula and check how it looks like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:23:19] Yes, I am
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:23:33] TheWild: I'm sorry but I wasn't answering your question. I don't really know anything about interpolation
2021-07-17 23:58:54	TheWild	[10:23:51] anyway, it gave me some idea
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:24:21] tempate: here's a heuristics.. I think this is a 'safe' heuristics for algebraic sets over R and C, but when you get over more exotic rings you might want to ask someone more qualified
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:24:43] fair enough
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:24:47] tempate: a k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space will have to be described by (n-k) polynomials
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:25:37] or I guess (n-k) polynomials describes a k dimensional object in R^n or C^n
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:25:49] ok
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:26:05] its a heuristic in the sense that there are singularities, and ofc degenerate cases like (x^2+y^2 = 0) doesnt describe a surface in R^2
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:26:09] so we could have V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) for our original problem?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:26:12] (in R^3 sorry)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:26:35] tempate: you might want to check, show that you dont end up with extra points, and all points are included
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:27:04] how can I make sure that no extra points are included though?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:28:38] it's fairly clear here that y must be x^2 and z must be x^3
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:28:53]  ok.. I don't know the fancy alg geom stuff, I can only work with ideals where the elements are functions on the space itself.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:29:28] tempate: but I thought this statement is true: if x is a pt in V(p1,...,pn) then p1(x) = 0, ..., pn(x) = 0
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:29:47] yes, that's correct
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:29:49] (I thought thats how you define V(I)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:29:51] (I thought thats how you define V(I))
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:30:25] tempate: so let p be a point in V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , and show that p is in {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k}
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:30:43] this ammount to finding t such that p = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:31:15] (tempate also if you can't tell I'm a bit aprehensive about alg geom lol)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:31:26] heh, yeah, don't worry
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:31:31] TheWild: did your idea work?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:31:31] you're helping me a lot
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:32:23] In any case, say that V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) works for our case. How would I show that it's irreducible?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:32:49] this would be an area where you're probably more qualified to answer than I am
2021-07-17 23:58:54	TheWild	[10:32:57] actually I'm bugged by other dude... but I'm going to check that out
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:33:13] tempate: but I thought for certain rings, irreducible <-> prime ideal (or some other condition on the ideal?)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	 *	tempate [10:33:33] checks his notes
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:33:49] tempate: the name of the game is to translate geometric description into a statement about the corresponding ideal/or the quotient ring
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:34:27] tempate: which book are you reading? I might join in lol
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:35:03] Yeah, it's a corollary from Hilbert's Nullstellenstaz apparently: if I is a prime ideal, V(I) is irreducible.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:35:32] (I think it goes both ways but I'm not sure)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[10:35:37] Fangs, cherim_, great question! no idea
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:35:43] Fangs: Algebraic Curves by Fulton
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:36:06] Fangs: I'm in the second chapter now, so you're by no means late to the party
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:36:22] oh thats a commonly recommended one, and its not hearthsorne
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:36:43] *hartshorne
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:37:20] it'd be great for you to join, but no pressure
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:38:32] so the plan now is to show that it's a prime ideal, eh
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:38:47] oh 1.3 even
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:39:10] tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:39:24] or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:39:43] I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:39:55] yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:40:15] I believe you also have to throw in I != R
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:40:29] yeah
2021-07-17 23:58:54	TheWild	[10:42:09] Fangs: this gonna get funny if I somewhat end up with sinc :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:42:55] do you know what a (with a dash hovering over it) is supposed to stand for?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:43:27] as here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2154432/show-that-the-ideal-is-prime
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:44:57] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ApDGvm6e/img.jpg
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:45:03] tempate: I don't really see any dash
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[10:45:10] people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[10:45:12] makes sense?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[10:45:16] the image of a in the quotient
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:45:25] oh nvm I'm an idiot
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:45:30] I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:46:52] also what buster said
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:46:54] acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:47:29] oh, the mean of the mean...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[10:47:38] tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:47:39] then not
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:49:05] acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:50:03] if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[10:50:27] if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:50:28] Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[10:51:45] as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:52:30] C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[10:52:36] i.e. the means just add
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[10:52:47] tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:53:07] tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:53:29] if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:53:39] and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[10:54:06] acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[10:54:28] buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:54:51] oh
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:55:00] tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:55:10] Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:55:19] tempate: no f is a ring hom
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:55:24] ok
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:55:34] it sends polynomials to polynomials
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[10:55:40] one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:55:53] tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:56:38] so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:57:09] (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:57:15] yes, it does make sense
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[10:57:41] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:58:04] if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[10:58:35] my naive self is having trouble thinking about the kernel of such a homomorphism. how's it not just (0, 0, 0) ?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[10:58:58] tempate: remember that C[x,y,z] is a ring of polynomials
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[10:59:36] or x_[1]/3 if you are taking that kind of mean
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:00:08] so elements in there looks like _ 1+ _x + _y + _z + _x^2 + _xy + _xz + _yz + _y^2 + _z^2 + ...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:00:44] where the underlines are just C-coefficients.. I thought using a,b,c, etc for them was confusing and a1 etc are not super intuitive either
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:01:00] _ works
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:01:07] ok, I see
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[11:01:10] per pure count or per ratio, for ratio you can't take (a+b)/(a+b) for instance that would be (a+b)/2 rather
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[11:01:29] oops, that's covariance. the variance one (Welford's) is further up the article
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:02:18] I'm having trouble understanding it because I don't see how f(x) = t is ever going to be zero (given that x is not 0) regardless of what y and z are
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:02:59] tempate: f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:03:08] since f is a ring homomorphism
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:03:40] oh
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:03:47] (well implicitly I also assumed its a C-algebra homomorphism... just means any complex number constants can be pulled outside of the function freely.. f(2x) = 2f(x))
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:04:08] tempate: so with that example that's 3w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:04:20] tempate: have you had a course in abstract algebra?)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:04:39] Fangs: yes, about a year ago
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:04:55] yeah time is a rough thing
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:05:08] :^)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:05:32] hello
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:05:58] with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w ?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:05:59] I can't do any analysis, at all.. you might be able to do this in less than a day: a convex function f: (a,b) -> R is continuous on (a,b)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	zacts	[11:06:00] hello
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:06:10] anyone can rec a book which teaches shannons information theorems?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:06:17] which is afforadble..
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:06:25] tempate: no, "I defined" f(x) = t, f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:06:50] riv: physical book? or pdf?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:06:57] riv: I read https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23057894-information-theory?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=67Ko2IllS2&rank=8 which was decently good
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:07:22] riv: I will send you a pdf of a book if you can tell me what it is (I'll look on libgen)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:07:42] i have PDFs
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:07:42] riv: if its a physical book try abebooks for 2nd hand books
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:07:49] my problem is that I want a real book
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:07:54] and the book I actually like is 90 quid :(
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:08:02] i will check abe books ty
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:08:03] riv: 2ndhand?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:08:06] riv: it's not a purely technical book (I don't recall there being any proofs) but it did a good job of giving an intuitive idea of the theorems
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:08:12] yes happy second hand
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:08:17] i wish I could borrow from a library too
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:08:18] kk
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:08:26] i can't even go in the local uni for reference anymore :/
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:08:32] riv: are you affiliated with a uni?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:08:34] no
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:08:44] but i have a reference card
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:08:48] why can't you go to the local uni?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:08:53] student account? can you use the uni library? they usually have inter-library loan
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:08:54] which does nothing now because the virus
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:08:58] ahhhh
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:09:06] yeah ok that's fair.. I forgot the virus is still a thing
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-17 23:58:54	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-17 23:58:54	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-17 23:58:54	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-17 23:58:54	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-17 23:58:54	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-17 23:58:54	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-17 23:58:54	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-17 23:58:54	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-17 23:58:54	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-17 23:58:54	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-17 23:58:54	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-17 23:58:54	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-17 23:58:54	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-17 23:58:54	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-17 23:58:54	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-17 23:58:54	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-17 23:58:54	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-17 23:58:54	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-17 23:58:54	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-17 23:58:54	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-17 23:58:54	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-17 23:58:54	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-17 23:58:54	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-17 23:58:54	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-17 23:58:54	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[17:47:22] particle-wave duality
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[17:47:23] lol
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[17:58:10] *thought
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[18:03:38] why unify ?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[18:07:44] if the solution is in creating fiction with half working math (or none at all on close inspection) and danger of more confusion i'd rather stick to the mosaic
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[18:08:07] erm, sorry
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:08:09] it seems my ignore list is empty, so i don't quite understand what is going on
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Inline	[18:10:14] taeaad: that was not to you with your rock stuff
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[18:10:41] Oh, OK.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:11:25] people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	taeaad	[18:11:29] Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:12:54] acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-17 23:58:54	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-17 23:58:54	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors
2021-07-17 23:58:54	int-e	[18:24:00] Z-module: (in addition to restricting to vertical planes)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[18:24:10] anyway, it's neat how merely a well-ordering of R (or of R^3 or of all the circles in R^3, same thing) is what enables all of this, without having to use c = aleph_1. There are other types of magic constructions where you do need CH.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:24:18] johnkeats6: mornfall which one is it?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:24:54] acresearch: let me try a different way… you have surely heard of mapreduce?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:25:07] mornfall: no
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:25:15] damn
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:25:27] mornfall: sorry
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Z-module	[18:25:45] Like my very favorite equivalent of CH:   CH  iff  There exists a single function f:R -> R so that the plane is the union of countably many sets, where each set is either some translate of the graph of f, or a translate of that graph rotated by pi/2 radians.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:26:15] acresearch: compute the sum of squared errors (don't take the square root) of each sub-list, sum up those, then take the root
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mornfall	[18:26:57] acresearch: (don't divide by the number of elements either… think about how you would compute the mean of all the values instead, without loading them all into ram)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	acresearch	[18:26:58] mornfall: ok 1 moment let me code it

2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[07:52:31] I guess I'll join the group waiting for buster's answer
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[07:53:04] which area of physics?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[07:53:46] Statistical physics / condensed matter
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[07:56:31] We have Rogers-Ramanujan identities in stat.phys. :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[07:58:16] cherim_: do you know anything about operation research?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[07:58:41] if you're in charge of a maths dept, would you rather tack the discrete math folks with the math physics people? or the operation research people?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[07:58:52] (I guess that question is a bit ill defined)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:00:09] I am not sure what you ask
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:01:12] Typically people in modern theoretical physics and mathematics do very similar things
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:01:36] cherim_: my university just restructured our program, specifically "Applied Math + Math Physics", "Discerete Mathematics + Operation Research" --> "applied math + math bio", "math physics + discrete maths", "operation research"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:02:19] I thought "Applied Math + Math Physics" made sense, but DM + OR didn't.. with the new one I think it made a lot more sense to combine math phsyics with discrete maths
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:03:08] I think it should be possible to get more information about the tracks than the titles
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:03:25] It's easy to suggest some reasonable content for each of the above
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:04:12] DM+OR could be just theoretical CS, and MPh+DM could focus on exacly solvable models, Baxter-style
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:04:16] I can PM you a picture of the courses available under each program
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:04:57] and link you the course description if you're interested (but the picture should explain most of the stuff)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:05:05] I can look, but it sounds like a personal preference decision
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:06:18] left is old, right is new, and I haven't really finished with the other specializations, but I was able to finish those three
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:06:39] Adv Discerete Maths covers: Ramsey theory, graph theory, posets and lattices, enumeration, integer partitions, combinatorial designs, and finite geometries;
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:07:55] enumerative combinatoricsL "generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, partitions of numbers,  of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics:
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:08:41] used to think that DM+OR would be 'theoretical CS" inclined but its really not, its pretty industry focused and pragmatic
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:09:12] Ok, ok, I understand what the specializations are from the lists. But can you clarify what you want my opinion on?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:09:34] Also, the png seems to be cut, and the second link not to the same content
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:09:35] I suppose I should explain why I even care about this
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:10:44] sent you the uncut version.. there's more stuff for the other specialization but they didnt change much
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:11:28] cherim_: I'm mostly trying to figure out 1.) how unversities decides the structure of these courses (probably unanswerable here) and 2.) if this change seems to indicate my maths dept is in trouble, or if this change actually make sense and indicate growth
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:11:28] lol
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:12:03] you know how universities goes.. "oh, we have restructured and rebranded our courses to give students a more streamlined student experience^tm"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:12:14] (but in reality they just wanted to do some cuts)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:12:54] You can't really deduce this from course lists
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:13:25] cherim_: seeing how 'equitable' the change is, I think its a weak evidence that its probably not tied to budget cuts or anything
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:13:31] Probably they had some change in influental faculty, some expert that an cover biological applications joined or such
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:13:34] Lie algebras is actually a new course
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:14:39] I think that's possible. over the last few years they seems to put a bigger focus on math bio too. the subjects for math bio did used to exists, but never acknowledged as a specialization 'formally'
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:15:32] cherim_: you woldn't know from what I shared so far, but each specialization got a new class.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:16:10] I am involved in similar restructurings of syllabus here
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:16:27] I see
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:16:36] And most often this comes from the change of available lecturers/researchers
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:17:13] Or some targeted state programs, like "support for computational biology at national level"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:17:41] right, the "actual" political side of things is not one I even considered
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:19:31] If you want to know how the university is doing, ask your favorite professor directly... It's crazy to do fine-grained analysis on the basis of "enumerative combinatorics is now not DMOR but MPPC"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:19:58] cherim_: I doubt I can ask them directly and bluntly
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:20:53] I've classified the faculties into two rough groups. those who seems to have a love for sticking to regulations and these monolithic tome of "policies", and others who are not into that
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[08:21:14] Maybe they won't tell you directly and bluntly (may as well tell), but they will certainly not punish you for asking
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:21:45] most faculties seems to be too polite to be in the latter group, and would usually answer with phrases like "our graduate program provide an excellent opprotunities for students to learn what they want"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:23:39] also I've been burnt before trying to go against the status quo as an undergrad, I'm trying to avoid that. I suspect I already made some enemies there, and I don't plan to make more
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:25:37] (I was trying to take graduate courses as part of my undergrad, that was a battle and a half)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:25:50] (a couple of faculty did most of the work)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:47:50] cherim_: I'm not sure if you're into university politics (I suspect not) but I've always wondered about the "why" unviersities are run the way that they are
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[08:49:02] I think in general universities has become more administrative heavy, and much more regulated with more policies and procedures. its easy to immediately think this is inherently bad, but this change is probably a reaction to something. there has to be a history to why we end up where we are
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[09:45:22] hello
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[09:51:03] an interpolating function for infinitely many points, infinitely differentiable (eventually to a constant), not necessarily differentiable everywhere. The function is expected to take "minimum energy state", that is, without little monsters like sin(x) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#/media/File:Gamma_plus_sin_pi_z.svg
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[09:51:03] Do you know of such a function/method?  It's not a quation I know the answer for.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:02:20] TheWild: I believe every polynomial is infinitely differentiable
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:03:09] What's the standard approach to prove that an algebraic set is irreducible?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:04:11] In particular, I have to show that {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k} is a variety.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:05:50] So I thought I'd first show that it's an algebraic set and then I would show that it's irreducible. I believe it's an algebraic set because it's the zeros of f(x, y, z) = x^3 + xy - 2z
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[10:06:29] the problem with polynomials is that for infinitely many points the... they just do not seem to work in practice because of mindbogglingly huge numbers.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[10:06:57] or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:13:28] tempate: what about (0,1,0)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:13:37] is that a zero of your polynomial?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:17:47] Fangs: I guess it is
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:18:21] tempate: your 'space' is included in the zero of your polynomial, but its not equal to
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:18:28] Fangs: maybe f(x, y, z) = x^3 + sqrt(y^3) - 2z is better?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:18:29] so its not the zeros of your polynomial
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:18:38] that's not apolynomial
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:18:59] Hmmm
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:19:05] tempate: I recall having this conversation before, didn't I gave your variety as the zero of two polynomials?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:19:27] tempate: let's... not get too fancy. lets take the real line in R^3
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:19:40] the real line (t,0,0), t in R
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:19:50] tempate: how would you describe this as an ideal in R[x,y,z]?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:20:10] Fangs: if you want me to be completely honest, and I recall it correctly, I think I wasn't convinced with the answer you gave me
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:20:19] (can you describe the ideal with just one polynomial? i.e. is it a principal ideal? or do you need two?)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:20:40] tempate: its fine, question it. I dont know alg geom, and even if I do always check what other people say
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:21:31] tempate: its imporant to note that R[x,y,z] and C[x,y,z] are not principal ideal domain, meaning there are ideals that are not generated by one element
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:21:36] I guess we could have something like f(x, y, z) = y (or z)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:22:04] just y = 0 gives you the x-z plane, ditto z = 0 with x-y plane
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:22:15] Yeah, right
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:22:47] so... V(y, z) ?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:22:54] tempate: int his case I hope you're convinced that R[x,y,z] / (y = 0, z = 0) is approriate here
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:23:10] and as a ring, R[x] as the set of functions on your x-axis seems to make a lot of sense
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[10:23:10] Fangs: you mean (...,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...)?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[10:23:10] hmm... interesting. Let's put it into formula and check how it looks like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:23:19] Yes, I am
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:23:33] TheWild: I'm sorry but I wasn't answering your question. I don't really know anything about interpolation
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[10:23:51] anyway, it gave me some idea
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:24:21] tempate: here's a heuristics.. I think this is a 'safe' heuristics for algebraic sets over R and C, but when you get over more exotic rings you might want to ask someone more qualified
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:24:43] fair enough
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:24:47] tempate: a k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space will have to be described by (n-k) polynomials
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:25:37] or I guess (n-k) polynomials describes a k dimensional object in R^n or C^n
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:25:49] ok
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:26:05] its a heuristic in the sense that there are singularities, and ofc degenerate cases like (x^2+y^2 = 0) doesnt describe a surface in R^2
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:26:09] so we could have V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) for our original problem?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:26:12] (in R^3 sorry)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:26:35] tempate: you might want to check, show that you dont end up with extra points, and all points are included
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:27:04] how can I make sure that no extra points are included though?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:28:38] it's fairly clear here that y must be x^2 and z must be x^3
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:28:53]  ok.. I don't know the fancy alg geom stuff, I can only work with ideals where the elements are functions on the space itself.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:29:28] tempate: but I thought this statement is true: if x is a pt in V(p1,...,pn) then p1(x) = 0, ..., pn(x) = 0
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:29:47] yes, that's correct
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:29:49] (I thought thats how you define V(I)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:29:51] (I thought thats how you define V(I))
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:30:25] tempate: so let p be a point in V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , and show that p is in {(t, t^2, t^3) | t \in k}
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:30:43] this ammount to finding t such that p = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:31:15] (tempate also if you can't tell I'm a bit aprehensive about alg geom lol)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:31:26] heh, yeah, don't worry
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:31:31] TheWild: did your idea work?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:31:31] you're helping me a lot
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:32:23] In any case, say that V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) works for our case. How would I show that it's irreducible?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:32:49] this would be an area where you're probably more qualified to answer than I am
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[10:32:57] actually I'm bugged by other dude... but I'm going to check that out
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:33:13] tempate: but I thought for certain rings, irreducible <-> prime ideal (or some other condition on the ideal?)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	 *	tempate [10:33:33] checks his notes
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:33:49] tempate: the name of the game is to translate geometric description into a statement about the corresponding ideal/or the quotient ring
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:34:27] tempate: which book are you reading? I might join in lol
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:35:03] Yeah, it's a corollary from Hilbert's Nullstellenstaz apparently: if I is a prime ideal, V(I) is irreducible.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:35:32] (I think it goes both ways but I'm not sure)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[10:35:37] Fangs, cherim_, great question! no idea
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:35:43] Fangs: Algebraic Curves by Fulton
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:36:06] Fangs: I'm in the second chapter now, so you're by no means late to the party
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:36:22] oh thats a commonly recommended one, and its not hearthsorne
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:36:43] *hartshorne
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:37:20] it'd be great for you to join, but no pressure
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:38:32] so the plan now is to show that it's a prime ideal, eh
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:38:47] oh 1.3 even
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:39:10] tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:39:24] or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:39:43] I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:39:55] yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:40:15] I believe you also have to throw in I != R
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:40:29] yeah
2021-07-18 00:01:22	TheWild	[10:42:09] Fangs: this gonna get funny if I somewhat end up with sinc :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:42:55] do you know what a (with a dash hovering over it) is supposed to stand for?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:43:27] as here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2154432/show-that-the-ideal-is-prime
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:44:57] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ApDGvm6e/img.jpg
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:45:03] tempate: I don't really see any dash
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[10:45:10] people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[10:45:12] makes sense?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[10:45:16] the image of a in the quotient
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:45:25] oh nvm I'm an idiot
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:45:30] I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:46:52] also what buster said
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:46:54] acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:47:29] oh, the mean of the mean...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[10:47:38] tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:47:39] then not
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:49:05] acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:50:03] if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[10:50:27] if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:50:28] Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[10:51:45] as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:52:30] C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[10:52:36] i.e. the means just add
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[10:52:47] tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:53:07] tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:53:29] if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:53:39] and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[10:54:06] acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[10:54:28] buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:54:51] oh
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:55:00] tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:55:10] Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:55:19] tempate: no f is a ring hom
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:55:24] ok
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:55:34] it sends polynomials to polynomials
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[10:55:40] one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:55:53] tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:56:38] so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:57:09] (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:57:15] yes, it does make sense
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[10:57:41] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:58:04] if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[10:58:35] my naive self is having trouble thinking about the kernel of such a homomorphism. how's it not just (0, 0, 0) ?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[10:58:58] tempate: remember that C[x,y,z] is a ring of polynomials
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[10:59:36] or x_[1]/3 if you are taking that kind of mean
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:00:08] so elements in there looks like _ 1+ _x + _y + _z + _x^2 + _xy + _xz + _yz + _y^2 + _z^2 + ...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:00:44] where the underlines are just C-coefficients.. I thought using a,b,c, etc for them was confusing and a1 etc are not super intuitive either
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:01:00] _ works
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:01:07] ok, I see
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[11:01:10] per pure count or per ratio, for ratio you can't take (a+b)/(a+b) for instance that would be (a+b)/2 rather
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[11:01:29] oops, that's covariance. the variance one (Welford's) is further up the article
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:02:18] I'm having trouble understanding it because I don't see how f(x) = t is ever going to be zero (given that x is not 0) regardless of what y and z are
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:02:59] tempate: f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:03:08] since f is a ring homomorphism
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:03:40] oh
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:03:47] (well implicitly I also assumed its a C-algebra homomorphism... just means any complex number constants can be pulled outside of the function freely.. f(2x) = 2f(x))
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:04:08] tempate: so with that example that's 3w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:04:20] tempate: have you had a course in abstract algebra?)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:04:39] Fangs: yes, about a year ago
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:04:55] yeah time is a rough thing
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:05:08] :^)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:05:32] hello
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:05:58] with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w ?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:05:59] I can't do any analysis, at all.. you might be able to do this in less than a day: a convex function f: (a,b) -> R is continuous on (a,b)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	zacts	[11:06:00] hello
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:06:10] anyone can rec a book which teaches shannons information theorems?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:06:17] which is afforadble..
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:06:25] tempate: no, "I defined" f(x) = t, f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:06:50] riv: physical book? or pdf?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:06:57] riv: I read https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23057894-information-theory?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=67Ko2IllS2&rank=8 which was decently good
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:07:22] riv: I will send you a pdf of a book if you can tell me what it is (I'll look on libgen)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:07:42] i have PDFs
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:07:42] riv: if its a physical book try abebooks for 2nd hand books
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:07:49] my problem is that I want a real book
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:07:54] and the book I actually like is 90 quid :(
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:08:02] i will check abe books ty
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:08:03] riv: 2ndhand?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:08:06] riv: it's not a purely technical book (I don't recall there being any proofs) but it did a good job of giving an intuitive idea of the theorems
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:08:12] yes happy second hand
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:08:17] i wish I could borrow from a library too
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:08:18] kk
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:08:26] i can't even go in the local uni for reference anymore :/
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:08:32] riv: are you affiliated with a uni?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:08:34] no
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:08:44] but i have a reference card
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:08:48] why can't you go to the local uni?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:08:53] student account? can you use the uni library? they usually have inter-library loan
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:08:54] which does nothing now because the virus
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:08:58] ahhhh
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:09:06] yeah ok that's fair.. I forgot the virus is still a thing
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-18 00:01:22	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-18 00:01:22	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-18 00:01:22	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-18 00:01:22	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-18 00:01:22	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-18 00:01:22	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-18 00:01:22	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-18 00:01:22	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-18 00:01:22	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-18 00:01:22	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-18 00:01:22	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-18 00:01:22	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-18 00:01:22	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-18 00:01:22	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-18 00:01:22	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-18 00:01:22	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-18 00:01:22	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-18 00:01:22	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-18 00:01:22	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-18 00:01:22	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-18 00:01:22	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-18 00:01:22	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-18 00:01:22	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-18 00:01:22	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-18 00:01:22	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.

2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.

2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[18:07:44] if the solution is in creating fiction with half working math (or none at all on close inspection) and danger of more confusion i'd rather stick to the mosaic
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[18:08:07] erm, sorry
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:08:09] it seems my ignore list is empty, so i don't quite understand what is going on
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Inline	[18:10:14] taeaad: that was not to you with your rock stuff
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[18:10:41] Oh, OK.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:11:25] people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	taeaad	[18:11:29] Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:12:54] acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-18 00:01:22	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-18 00:01:22	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors
2021-07-18 00:01:22	int-e	[18:24:00] Z-module: (in addition to restricting to vertical planes)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[18:24:10] anyway, it's neat how merely a well-ordering of R (or of R^3 or of all the circles in R^3, same thing) is what enables all of this, without having to use c = aleph_1. There are other types of magic constructions where you do need CH.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:24:18] johnkeats6: mornfall which one is it?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:24:54] acresearch: let me try a different way… you have surely heard of mapreduce?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:25:07] mornfall: no
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:25:15] damn
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:25:27] mornfall: sorry
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Z-module	[18:25:45] Like my very favorite equivalent of CH:   CH  iff  There exists a single function f:R -> R so that the plane is the union of countably many sets, where each set is either some translate of the graph of f, or a translate of that graph rotated by pi/2 radians.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:26:15] acresearch: compute the sum of squared errors (don't take the square root) of each sub-list, sum up those, then take the root
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mornfall	[18:26:57] acresearch: (don't divide by the number of elements either… think about how you would compute the mean of all the values instead, without loading them all into ram)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	acresearch	[18:26:58] mornfall: ok 1 moment let me code it

2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:31:31] TheWild: did your idea work?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:31:31] you're helping me a lot
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:32:23] In any case, say that V(x^2 - y, x^3 - z) works for our case. How would I show that it's irreducible?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:32:49] this would be an area where you're probably more qualified to answer than I am
2021-07-18 01:15:17	TheWild	[10:32:57] actually I'm bugged by other dude... but I'm going to check that out
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:33:13] tempate: but I thought for certain rings, irreducible <-> prime ideal (or some other condition on the ideal?)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	 *	tempate [10:33:33] checks his notes
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:33:49] tempate: the name of the game is to translate geometric description into a statement about the corresponding ideal/or the quotient ring
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:34:27] tempate: which book are you reading? I might join in lol
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:35:03] Yeah, it's a corollary from Hilbert's Nullstellenstaz apparently: if I is a prime ideal, V(I) is irreducible.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:35:32] (I think it goes both ways but I'm not sure)

2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:38:47] oh 1.3 even
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:39:10] tempate: an ideal is prime iff the quotient is an integral domain iirc
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:39:24] or I guess you could show it more directly
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:39:43] I forgot what the analogue was.. think if xy in I, then x in I or y in I
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:39:55] yeah, I knew that last one
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:40:15] I believe you also have to throw in I != R

2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[10:45:10] people, i have a question regarding order of operations: if i have 3 lists of numbers [X1, X2, X3] and i want to find the mean and SD of all numbers in all the lists.    logically i would first combine the lists into 1 list, then find the mean and SD correct?    would i get the same answer is if calculate the mean/SD of each list  then the mean of the mean and SD of the SD to combine the values?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[10:45:12] makes sense?

2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:45:30] I didn't scrolled down...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:46:52] also what buster said
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:46:54] acresearch: I believe you would. Have you tried it out with any examples?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:47:29] oh, the mean of the mean...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[10:47:38] tempate: so each list in 1M points, and i have 30K lists... sooo experimenting would be difficult hence i am asking here for insight
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:47:39] then not
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:49:05] acresearch: changing my answer to yes once again
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:50:03] if all lists have the same number of elements I don't see why it'd make a difference
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[10:50:27] if you have two lists [x1,x2,x3] and [y1,y2,y3] the mean of the first is [x1/(x1+x2+x3),...] the mean of the second is [y1/(y1+y2+y3),...] now if you want to find the mean of both you get [(x1+y1)/(x1+x2+x3+y1+y2+y3),....]
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:50:28] Fangs & buster: alright, thanks
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[10:51:45] as long as the lists are the same size, otherwise you have to jump in order to correct for the indices....
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:52:30] C[x,y,z]/ (x^2 - y, x^3 - z) , so in this ring x^2 = y and x^3 = z
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[10:52:36] i.e. the means just add
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[10:52:47] tempate: ok let me try
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:53:07] tempate: I propose we try this map f: C[x,y,z] -> C[w] with f(x) = w, f(y) = w^2 and f(z) = w^3
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:53:29] if you can show that the kernel is given by previous ideal, then we can say the quotient ring is iso to C[w]
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:53:39] and C[w] is an integral domain, hence ideal was prime
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[10:54:06] acresearch, you know there's a streaming algorithm (O(1) additional memory) for mean and variance?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[10:54:28] buster: no i do not know, what do you mean? please elaborate
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:54:51] oh
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:55:00] tempate: substitute C[w] with C[t]
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:55:10] Fangs: does f have to be a polynomial?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:55:19] tempate: no f is a ring hom
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:55:24] ok
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:55:34] it sends polynomials to polynomials
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[10:55:40] one of knuth's maybe (he certainly wrote about it). i might have a link somewhere
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:55:53] tempate: in the paramtereization, we end up equating (x,y,z) = (t,t^2,t^3)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:56:38] so the ring homomorphism f: C[x,y,z] -> C[t] with f(x) = t and f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3 seems to make certain sense to my naive self
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:57:09] (and indeed the set you described with t seems to be a line in C^3, so the quotient ring should reflect that)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:57:15] yes, it does make sense
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[10:57:41] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:58:04] if you want to be anal, you might want to prove that C[t] is an integral domain too, it might be a good exercise if you aren't comfortable with ring theory yet
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[10:58:35] my naive self is having trouble thinking about the kernel of such a homomorphism. how's it not just (0, 0, 0) ?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[10:58:58] tempate: remember that C[x,y,z] is a ring of polynomials
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[10:59:36] or x_[1]/3 if you are taking that kind of mean
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:00:08] so elements in there looks like _ 1+ _x + _y + _z + _x^2 + _xy + _xz + _yz + _y^2 + _z^2 + ...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:00:44] where the underlines are just C-coefficients.. I thought using a,b,c, etc for them was confusing and a1 etc are not super intuitive either
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:01:00] _ works
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:01:07] ok, I see
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[11:01:10] per pure count or per ratio, for ratio you can't take (a+b)/(a+b) for instance that would be (a+b)/2 rather
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[11:01:29] oops, that's covariance. the variance one (Welford's) is further up the article
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:02:18] I'm having trouble understanding it because I don't see how f(x) = t is ever going to be zero (given that x is not 0) regardless of what y and z are
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:02:59] tempate: f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:03:08] since f is a ring homomorphism
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:03:40] oh
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:03:47] (well implicitly I also assumed its a C-algebra homomorphism... just means any complex number constants can be pulled outside of the function freely.. f(2x) = 2f(x))
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:04:08] tempate: so with that example that's 3w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:04:20] tempate: have you had a course in abstract algebra?)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:04:39] Fangs: yes, about a year ago
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:04:55] yeah time is a rough thing
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:05:08] :^)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:05:32] hello
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:05:58] with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w ?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:05:59] I can't do any analysis, at all.. you might be able to do this in less than a day: a convex function f: (a,b) -> R is continuous on (a,b)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	zacts	[11:06:00] hello
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:06:10] anyone can rec a book which teaches shannons information theorems?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:06:17] which is afforadble..
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:06:25] tempate: no, "I defined" f(x) = t, f(y) = t^2 and f(z) = t^3
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:06:50] riv: physical book? or pdf?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:06:57] riv: I read https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23057894-information-theory?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=67Ko2IllS2&rank=8 which was decently good
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:07:22] riv: I will send you a pdf of a book if you can tell me what it is (I'll look on libgen)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:07:42] i have PDFs
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:07:42] riv: if its a physical book try abebooks for 2nd hand books
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:07:49] my problem is that I want a real book
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:07:54] and the book I actually like is 90 quid :(
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:08:02] i will check abe books ty
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:08:03] riv: 2ndhand?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:08:06] riv: it's not a purely technical book (I don't recall there being any proofs) but it did a good job of giving an intuitive idea of the theorems
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:08:12] yes happy second hand
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:08:17] i wish I could borrow from a library too
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:08:18] kk
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:08:26] i can't even go in the local uni for reference anymore :/
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:08:32] riv: are you affiliated with a uni?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:08:34] no
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:08:44] but i have a reference card
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:08:48] why can't you go to the local uni?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:08:53] student account? can you use the uni library? they usually have inter-library loan
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:08:54] which does nothing now because the virus
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:08:58] ahhhh
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:09:06] yeah ok that's fair.. I forgot the virus is still a thing
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-18 01:15:17	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-18 01:15:17	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-18 01:15:17	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-18 01:15:17	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-18 01:15:17	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-18 01:15:17	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-18 01:15:17	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-18 01:15:17	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-18 01:15:17	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-18 01:15:17	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-18 01:15:17	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-18 01:15:17	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-18 01:15:17	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-18 01:15:17	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-18 01:15:17	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-18 01:15:17	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-18 01:15:17	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-18 01:15:17	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-18 01:15:17	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-18 01:15:17	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-18 01:15:17	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-18 01:15:17	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-18 01:15:17	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-18 01:15:17	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-18 01:15:17	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[17:47:22] particle-wave duality
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[17:47:23] lol
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.

2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.

2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.

2021-07-18 01:15:17	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)

2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-18 01:15:17	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[18:24:00] Z-module: (in addition to restricting to vertical planes)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[18:24:10] anyway, it's neat how merely a well-ordering of R (or of R^3 or of all the circles in R^3, same thing) is what enables all of this, without having to use c = aleph_1. There are other types of magic constructions where you do need CH.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:24:18] johnkeats6: mornfall which one is it?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:24:54] acresearch: let me try a different way… you have surely heard of mapreduce?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:25:07] mornfall: no
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:25:15] damn
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:25:27] mornfall: sorry
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Z-module	[18:25:45] Like my very favorite equivalent of CH:   CH  iff  There exists a single function f:R -> R so that the plane is the union of countably many sets, where each set is either some translate of the graph of f, or a translate of that graph rotated by pi/2 radians.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:26:15] acresearch: compute the sum of squared errors (don't take the square root) of each sub-list, sum up those, then take the root
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:26:57] acresearch: (don't divide by the number of elements either… think about how you would compute the mean of all the values instead, without loading them all into ram)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:26:58] mornfall: ok 1 moment let me code it
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[18:32:34] johnkeats6, cherim_, with two of the typos fixed, http://mathb.in/60918 . in the first section, the images T(p), T(x) *aren't even in* my 2D space :/
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:34:51] What you struggle with has no specifics of non-commutativity or operators or physics
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:35:26] Actions of a linear transformation on vectors and on coordinates of vectors are different
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:35:49] Given by mutual transposes in terms of matrix elements
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:36:54] If you rewrite the last example (2D affine) in terms of what Te_x, Te_y are for coordinate orts e_x, e_y, you'll get the top matrix
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:38:55] mornfall: ok i tried your method, but i get a totally different number
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:39:20] Or yo can say that your (Weyl) algebra is parametrized by X*x+Y*p+Z*1 and describe transformations in terms of (X', Y', Z')=T(X, Y, Z)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:39:33] That will transpose the top form into bottom form
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:42:26] acresearch: you did the 1/N and the square root at the end, right?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:43:30] mornfall: N= total number of points in all lists right?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:43:36] sure
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:44:17] mornfall: ok i coded it,   but still very different number
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:44:23] first you sum everything in all lists and divide by N to get μ
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:44:34] mornfall: yes
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:45:23] then you compute the sum of (xᵢ - μ)² for each list, add those sums together, divide by N, take a square root
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[18:45:30] thanks cherim_. (coordinate orts? is that a typo? coordinates wrt?)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:45:36] make sure you don't overflow something
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:45:59] those are going to be some big numbers
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:47:20] mornfall: yes,   want to see my code?   it is crappy but follow these steps
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:47:39] Suppose you have a linear map T:R^3 ->R^3. You can define it by Te_1 = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3,  Te_2 = a' e_1 + b' e_2 + c' e_3, Te_3 = a'' e_1 + b'' e_2 + c'' e_3
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:47:46] then you are probably overflowing… consider import fractions if this is python
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[18:48:15] yep.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:48:16] Then T gets a "matrix" with coordinates a, b, c, a', ...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:49:07] mornfall: what do you mean?    here is my code: https://paste.debian.net/1204700/
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:49:15] You can also define the same transformation by saying that a vector with coordinates (x1, x2, x3) is mapped to (Ax1+Bx2+Cx3, A'x1+B'x2+C'x3, A''x1+B''x2+C''x3)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:49:36] Where the coordinates are as in v=x1 e1+x2 e2+x3 e3
2021-07-18 01:15:17	taeaad	[18:49:54] joel135: I think they are an alternative of sorts to a topological space.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:50:00] Then you get another matrix with entries A, B, C, A', ...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:50:03] acresearch: uhh, what?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:50:12] How is it related to the one with entries a, b, c, a'...?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:50:20] acresearch: mean = statistics.stdev(…)?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:50:28] mornfall: is it not?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:50:32] oh wait
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:50:37] dam   i mixed them up
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:50:43] acresearch: also you are not even close to doing what i told you to do
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:51:09] mornfall: i calcualted the standard error right?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:51:26] acresearch: you are calculating a bunch of nonsense, tbh…
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:51:32] mornfall: hmmmm
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:51:57] mornfall: ok let me go back and see how to calculate the standard error, i might have seen the wrong article
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:52:18] acresearch: just do what i told you to do, there isn't anything else to it, really
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[18:52:19] (a b c)^T = (A A' A'')^T, and so on. they are mutually transpose.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:52:28] In you mathbin paste the same happens. p, x, 1 are basis vectors of a Weyl algebra. Not coordinates. As I said, they can't be numbers already by noncommutativity
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:52:50] Like e1, e2, e3
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:53:19] So no wonder you get transposes
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:53:30] mornfall: calculate sum of error for each list, add all sum of errors, divide by N, sqrt  right?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:53:58] acresearch: yes, notice the part where you need the mean of the entire dataset for that
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:54:10] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:54:10] can't just take the mean of the sublist
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:54:24] mornfall: wait,   i am confused now
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:54:54] mornfall: no when calculating the standard error  i value-mean   where mean is of the while dataset?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:55:57] acresearch: for l in [X1, X2, X3]: { means.append(sum(l)); lens.append(len(l)) } ; mean = sum(sums)/sum(lens) ;
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[18:56:06] To be honest, if you are reading a physics book on "operators and canonical quantization" and try to interpret momentum and coordinate as numbers (simultaneously) in the exercises section, the book is not that good
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:56:21] acresearch: as i have explicitly said before… sum _all_ the data points and divide by the size of the entire data set
2021-07-18 01:15:17	loopspace	[18:56:50] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:57:10] acresearch: you are probably going to run into precision problems with floats
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[18:57:44] acresearch: you might want to ask someone more qualified to do this for you :\
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[18:58:39] mornfall: probably,  either way i am not getting the excpeted final SD,,, so i guess the closest approach is to just calculate the SD of each sub list and take a mean of all the SDs
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:00:56] acresearch: you are going to get random garbage
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:01:30] mornfall: there is no alternative, i think your approach works, but... i still need the mean of the whole database, which i cannot get because i cannot import it
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:01:49] *sigh*
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:01:59] mornfall: dealing with data larger than what a supercomputer can handel is frustrating :-(
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:02:13] i literally wrote that part of the program for you
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:02:21] mornfall: which did not work
2021-07-18 01:15:17	fweht	[19:02:33] im a bit confused why these maps F^f_t act on C^\infty(\mathbf{R}^{2n}) as opposed to directly on \mathbf{R}^{2n}? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CYruQnst/image.png
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:02:38] did you try it?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:02:48] to get the _mean_
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:02:50] mornfall: yes   one moment i will paste my code
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:04:46] mornfall: https://paste.debian.net/1204702/
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:06:00] acresearch: you messed up where the loop ends; the mean is obviously computed after the loop, not inside
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:06:09] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:08:26] mornfall: ok that gives me the final mean correctly
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:09:07] of course it does
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:09:53] mornfall: so then what about the final SD?   you said my code is wrong, which part?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[19:11:42] cherim_, i don't doubt you, but i don't follow what you're saying. in my paste, in the first section, p and x are always vectors (elements of the vector space, in this case an algebra), never coordinates. I abused the same letter T for the matrix (with respect to the basis {p,x,1} for a subspace) and the underlying linear transformation.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:14:24] acresearch: i already pointed that out
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:15:26] mornfall:  i fixed it, i still do not get the same number
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:16:14] then you probably didn't fix it right
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:16:55] mornfall: you can see my fix in the last code i sent you      final SD = 1.82  i got 1.59
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[19:16:55] What is your question about the exercise then? Are there any remaining?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mornfall	[19:17:07] (your last paste still uses the wrong mean)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:17:26] mornfall: ah   of each list    ok   let me fix that
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:18:14] mornfall: ok got a closer value    final SD = 1.82  i got 1.75
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[19:18:50] I understood that you don't like that 1) bottom 3x3 is the transpose of the top, 2) that Tp was not in the span <x, p> or some "2D space"
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[19:19:33] cherim_, I'll work on it. probably as soon as I can formulate a question that makes sense, I'll be able to answer it. I appreciate your efforts
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[19:20:02] The first is answered (but it's not even very important since groups tructures are isomorphic), the second is inconsistent with the meaning of p, x
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[19:20:28] p'=ap+bx+c in the statement is already not in a "2D space"
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[19:20:49] Since RHS is a combination of 3 linearly independent objects
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[19:21:59] Well, technically you can glue 1 and one of (p, x) by "fixing a representation as coordinate/momentum". But it's better left untouched
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[19:22:12] acresearch: one subtle detail is that stdev() divides by (n-1), where n is the sample size; so it's the usual unbiased estimator for the standard deviation.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	buster	[19:22:40] mm. i suppose i'm misinterpreting the other part of the question, where it asks for a group of symmetries of the complex 'plane' C^2.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[19:23:10] acresearch: But this whole computation is rather intricate. https://paste.debian.net/1204705/  seems to work
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:24:28] int-e: ok i have to go have dinner, i opened your paste, is it ok to look at it in 2 hour when i return?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	acresearch	[19:24:41] int-e: thank you for your input,    and mornfall thank you for your help too :-)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	int-e	[19:25:21] you don't need my permission... I may not be around then, don't know yet
2021-07-18 01:15:17	cherim_	[19:26:53] If I had to type this exercise, I'd first identify the automorphisms as a subgroup of SL(3, C) as you did, and only then note that the result is the same as complexification of area-preserving affine transformations

2021-07-18 04:50:59	riv	[11:09:24] I just find that im not really studying with it as a PDF, need a real  book
2021-07-18 04:50:59	tempate	[11:09:35] Fangs: oh, so that's what you meant. ok, on it.
2021-07-18 04:50:59	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-18 04:50:59	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-18 04:50:59	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-18 04:50:59	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-18 04:51:00	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-18 04:51:00	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	HisShadow	[11:12:59] astronaut: you can probably download it from wolfram mathematica site
2021-07-18 04:51:00	HisShadow	[11:13:28] astronaut: if it's an older version, that might be unavailable, try torrents
2021-07-18 04:51:00	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-18 04:51:00	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tempate	[11:15:04] thanks for spending so much time with this, Fangs
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	HisShadow	[11:16:02] astronaut: seems like you can just register to get wolfram id
2021-07-18 04:51:00	astronaut	[11:16:19] HisShadow, it is version 12
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-18 04:51:00	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-18 04:51:00	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."
2021-07-18 04:51:00	astronaut	[11:20:47] using my school email says that ''This email doesn't exist.''
2021-07-18 04:51:00	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-18 04:51:00	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-18 04:51:00	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-18 04:51:00	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-18 04:51:00	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-18 04:51:00	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-18 04:51:00	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-18 04:51:00	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-18 04:51:00	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-18 04:51:00	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-18 04:51:00	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-18 04:51:00	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-18 04:51:00	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-18 04:51:00	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-18 04:51:00	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-18 04:51:00	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[17:47:22] particle-wave duality
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[17:47:23] lol
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[17:58:10] *thought
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[18:03:38] why unify ?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[18:07:44] if the solution is in creating fiction with half working math (or none at all on close inspection) and danger of more confusion i'd rather stick to the mosaic
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[18:08:07] erm, sorry
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:08:09] it seems my ignore list is empty, so i don't quite understand what is going on
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Inline	[18:10:14] taeaad: that was not to you with your rock stuff
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[18:10:41] Oh, OK.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:11:25] people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[18:11:29] Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:12:54] acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-18 04:51:00	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[18:24:00] Z-module: (in addition to restricting to vertical planes)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[18:24:10] anyway, it's neat how merely a well-ordering of R (or of R^3 or of all the circles in R^3, same thing) is what enables all of this, without having to use c = aleph_1. There are other types of magic constructions where you do need CH.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:24:18] johnkeats6: mornfall which one is it?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:24:54] acresearch: let me try a different way… you have surely heard of mapreduce?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:25:07] mornfall: no
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:25:15] damn
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:25:27] mornfall: sorry
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Z-module	[18:25:45] Like my very favorite equivalent of CH:   CH  iff  There exists a single function f:R -> R so that the plane is the union of countably many sets, where each set is either some translate of the graph of f, or a translate of that graph rotated by pi/2 radians.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:26:15] acresearch: compute the sum of squared errors (don't take the square root) of each sub-list, sum up those, then take the root
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:26:57] acresearch: (don't divide by the number of elements either… think about how you would compute the mean of all the values instead, without loading them all into ram)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:26:58] mornfall: ok 1 moment let me code it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[18:32:34] johnkeats6, cherim_, with two of the typos fixed, http://mathb.in/60918 . in the first section, the images T(p), T(x) *aren't even in* my 2D space :/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:34:51] What you struggle with has no specifics of non-commutativity or operators or physics
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:35:26] Actions of a linear transformation on vectors and on coordinates of vectors are different
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:35:49] Given by mutual transposes in terms of matrix elements
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:36:54] If you rewrite the last example (2D affine) in terms of what Te_x, Te_y are for coordinate orts e_x, e_y, you'll get the top matrix
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:38:55] mornfall: ok i tried your method, but i get a totally different number
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:39:20] Or yo can say that your (Weyl) algebra is parametrized by X*x+Y*p+Z*1 and describe transformations in terms of (X', Y', Z')=T(X, Y, Z)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:39:33] That will transpose the top form into bottom form
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:42:26] acresearch: you did the 1/N and the square root at the end, right?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:43:30] mornfall: N= total number of points in all lists right?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:43:36] sure
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:44:17] mornfall: ok i coded it,   but still very different number
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:44:23] first you sum everything in all lists and divide by N to get μ
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:44:34] mornfall: yes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:45:23] then you compute the sum of (xᵢ - μ)² for each list, add those sums together, divide by N, take a square root
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[18:45:30] thanks cherim_. (coordinate orts? is that a typo? coordinates wrt?)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:45:36] make sure you don't overflow something
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:45:59] those are going to be some big numbers
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:47:20] mornfall: yes,   want to see my code?   it is crappy but follow these steps
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:47:39] Suppose you have a linear map T:R^3 ->R^3. You can define it by Te_1 = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3,  Te_2 = a' e_1 + b' e_2 + c' e_3, Te_3 = a'' e_1 + b'' e_2 + c'' e_3
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:47:46] then you are probably overflowing… consider import fractions if this is python
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[18:48:15] yep.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:48:16] Then T gets a "matrix" with coordinates a, b, c, a', ...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:49:07] mornfall: what do you mean?    here is my code: https://paste.debian.net/1204700/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:49:15] You can also define the same transformation by saying that a vector with coordinates (x1, x2, x3) is mapped to (Ax1+Bx2+Cx3, A'x1+B'x2+C'x3, A''x1+B''x2+C''x3)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:49:36] Where the coordinates are as in v=x1 e1+x2 e2+x3 e3
2021-07-18 04:51:00	taeaad	[18:49:54] joel135: I think they are an alternative of sorts to a topological space.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:50:00] Then you get another matrix with entries A, B, C, A', ...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:50:03] acresearch: uhh, what?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:50:12] How is it related to the one with entries a, b, c, a'...?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:50:20] acresearch: mean = statistics.stdev(…)?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:50:28] mornfall: is it not?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:50:32] oh wait
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:50:37] dam   i mixed them up
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:50:43] acresearch: also you are not even close to doing what i told you to do
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:51:09] mornfall: i calcualted the standard error right?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:51:26] acresearch: you are calculating a bunch of nonsense, tbh…
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:51:32] mornfall: hmmmm
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:51:57] mornfall: ok let me go back and see how to calculate the standard error, i might have seen the wrong article
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:52:18] acresearch: just do what i told you to do, there isn't anything else to it, really
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[18:52:19] (a b c)^T = (A A' A'')^T, and so on. they are mutually transpose.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:52:28] In you mathbin paste the same happens. p, x, 1 are basis vectors of a Weyl algebra. Not coordinates. As I said, they can't be numbers already by noncommutativity
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:52:50] Like e1, e2, e3
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:53:19] So no wonder you get transposes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:53:30] mornfall: calculate sum of error for each list, add all sum of errors, divide by N, sqrt  right?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:53:58] acresearch: yes, notice the part where you need the mean of the entire dataset for that
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:54:10] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:54:10] can't just take the mean of the sublist
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:54:24] mornfall: wait,   i am confused now
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:54:54] mornfall: no when calculating the standard error  i value-mean   where mean is of the while dataset?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:55:57] acresearch: for l in [X1, X2, X3]: { means.append(sum(l)); lens.append(len(l)) } ; mean = sum(sums)/sum(lens) ;
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[18:56:06] To be honest, if you are reading a physics book on "operators and canonical quantization" and try to interpret momentum and coordinate as numbers (simultaneously) in the exercises section, the book is not that good
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:56:21] acresearch: as i have explicitly said before… sum _all_ the data points and divide by the size of the entire data set
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[18:56:50] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:57:10] acresearch: you are probably going to run into precision problems with floats
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[18:57:44] acresearch: you might want to ask someone more qualified to do this for you :\
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[18:58:39] mornfall: probably,  either way i am not getting the excpeted final SD,,, so i guess the closest approach is to just calculate the SD of each sub list and take a mean of all the SDs
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:00:56] acresearch: you are going to get random garbage
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:01:30] mornfall: there is no alternative, i think your approach works, but... i still need the mean of the whole database, which i cannot get because i cannot import it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:01:49] *sigh*
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:01:59] mornfall: dealing with data larger than what a supercomputer can handel is frustrating :-(
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:02:13] i literally wrote that part of the program for you
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:02:21] mornfall: which did not work
2021-07-18 04:51:00	fweht	[19:02:33] im a bit confused why these maps F^f_t act on C^\infty(\mathbf{R}^{2n}) as opposed to directly on \mathbf{R}^{2n}? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CYruQnst/image.png
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:02:38] did you try it?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:02:48] to get the _mean_
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:02:50] mornfall: yes   one moment i will paste my code
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:04:46] mornfall: https://paste.debian.net/1204702/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:06:00] acresearch: you messed up where the loop ends; the mean is obviously computed after the loop, not inside
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:06:09] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:08:26] mornfall: ok that gives me the final mean correctly
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:09:07] of course it does
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:09:53] mornfall: so then what about the final SD?   you said my code is wrong, which part?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[19:11:42] cherim_, i don't doubt you, but i don't follow what you're saying. in my paste, in the first section, p and x are always vectors (elements of the vector space, in this case an algebra), never coordinates. I abused the same letter T for the matrix (with respect to the basis {p,x,1} for a subspace) and the underlying linear transformation.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:14:24] acresearch: i already pointed that out
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:15:26] mornfall:  i fixed it, i still do not get the same number
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:16:14] then you probably didn't fix it right
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:16:55] mornfall: you can see my fix in the last code i sent you      final SD = 1.82  i got 1.59
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[19:16:55] What is your question about the exercise then? Are there any remaining?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mornfall	[19:17:07] (your last paste still uses the wrong mean)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:17:26] mornfall: ah   of each list    ok   let me fix that
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:18:14] mornfall: ok got a closer value    final SD = 1.82  i got 1.75
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[19:18:50] I understood that you don't like that 1) bottom 3x3 is the transpose of the top, 2) that Tp was not in the span <x, p> or some "2D space"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[19:19:33] cherim_, I'll work on it. probably as soon as I can formulate a question that makes sense, I'll be able to answer it. I appreciate your efforts
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[19:20:02] The first is answered (but it's not even very important since groups tructures are isomorphic), the second is inconsistent with the meaning of p, x
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[19:20:28] p'=ap+bx+c in the statement is already not in a "2D space"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[19:20:49] Since RHS is a combination of 3 linearly independent objects
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[19:21:59] Well, technically you can glue 1 and one of (p, x) by "fixing a representation as coordinate/momentum". But it's better left untouched
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[19:22:12] acresearch: one subtle detail is that stdev() divides by (n-1), where n is the sample size; so it's the usual unbiased estimator for the standard deviation.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[19:22:40] mm. i suppose i'm misinterpreting the other part of the question, where it asks for a group of symmetries of the complex 'plane' C^2.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[19:23:10] acresearch: But this whole computation is rather intricate. https://paste.debian.net/1204705/  seems to work
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:24:28] int-e: ok i have to go have dinner, i opened your paste, is it ok to look at it in 2 hour when i return?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	acresearch	[19:24:41] int-e: thank you for your input,    and mornfall thank you for your help too :-)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[19:25:21] you don't need my permission... I may not be around then, don't know yet
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[19:26:53] If I had to type this exercise, I'd first identify the automorphisms as a subgroup of SL(3, C) as you did, and only then note that the result is the same as complexification of area-preserving affine transformations
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cherim_	[19:27:47] (in 2dimensions)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[19:28:46] ah. that word 'represent'. (<https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS>). I only need a homomorphism. I don't need a physical intuition of what the 2D thing is.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Daemonick	[19:34:11] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=javNyyatPac&list=PLXkgDiMUQalFc7baUr1fypt4UDLsCGL74&index=8

2021-07-18 04:51:00	Daemonick	[19:35:11] Archive - Londinium
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[19:35:24] fine
2021-07-18 04:51:00	greenbagels	[19:40:40] a mute for posting a music playlist?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[19:42:57] yes please
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:01:50] buster, i think you're overcomplicating it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:02:11] you have affine area-preserving maps, that's all the exercise asks you to reealize
2021-07-18 04:51:00	kenthurley	[20:26:25] Are there finite groups of the same cardinality but "completely unisomorphic"?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:28:52] kenthurley: there are two distinct (nonisomorphic) groups of size 4.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:29:26] C_4 and K_4 = C_2^2, where C_n is the cyclic group of order n.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:30:01] (that "the" is justified by considering groups up to isomorphism; take it with a grain of salt)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:34:58] johnkeats6, i'm sure! but now i'm worried about the transpose stuff cherim_ explained. i don't think my linear algebra is *that* lacking. i think i just failed to communicate what i meant. but i'm worried.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:35:51] here's a very belaboured version of an answer, no doubt still full of typos, but emphasizing the transposition as a feature not a bug: https://ibb.co/9sj6zBK
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:36:03] may it be even less fun to read than it was to write :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:36:36] buster, well, if you have a basis e_1, ..., e_n you can think of the 'coordinates' x_1, ..., x_n as really the dual basis, so that's where the transposing is coming from
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:36:47] oh man. i know! :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	kenthurley	[20:37:35] int-e: thank you for example, although I knew about it. For clarity, I'm on purpose asking about "completely unisomorphic". That is, something like for any bijection f between groups we would have f(xy)=f(x)f(y) for nothing except x=e or y=e. Well, that is not fully formal, but something like that
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:37:48] (C^3)^* !! :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:38:10] hopefully you won't be offended if i don't read it :p
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:38:31] i'm cut to the quick
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:40:46] kenthurley: no such group exists
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:40:53]  kenthurley: well, in any two such groups you'll have non-trivial isomorphic subgroups
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:41:15] kenthurley: if you require it for *any* bijection between groups, you can always send e in H to any non-identity element g in G
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:43:16] kenthurley: If p is a prime factor of |G| then G has a subgroup ismorphic to C_p. It's a corollary of the Sylow theorems (is there a more elementary proof without them?)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:43:40] yes, it's called cauchy's theorem
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:43:50] there's a cute proof
2021-07-18 04:51:00	newpy	[20:44:44] how many ways are there to arrange 3 distinguishable balls in 3 buckets?

2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:45:48] newpy: are they distinguishable buckets?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	newpy	[20:45:56] int-e, yes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:46:13] so, for each ball, pick a bucket...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	newpy	[20:46:29] int-e, 4^3?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:46:36] 3^3 as you wrote it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:46:58] it was something like: take the set of p-uples (g_1, ..., g_p) such that g_1 ... g_p = e, and let Z_p act on this by cyclically permuting this tuple.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	newpy	[20:47:10] int-e, whoops, so if we had 4 balls in 3 buckets?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:47:14] that's the one. Exercise 1.10, https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/14/mode/2up
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:47:20] newpy: then 3^4
2021-07-18 04:51:00	newpy	[20:47:21] 3^4?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:47:48] loopspace what's a^-1?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:48:10] a fixed point of this action is an element of order p
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:48:13] ah, they didn't do the bit where you extend it to non-abelian groups
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:48:17] Typo A^-1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:48:25] Presumably
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:48:56] loopspace: det A is -(w^2) right?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:49:06] det b is 1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:49:23] so det inv(A) should be -1/(w^2)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:49:48] and, uh, let me remember
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:49:55] was it orbit stabilizer?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:50:13] Fangs: herp derp. Thx
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:50:23] loopspace: is w^2 = 1/w^2? if w is the (2^{n} - 1)-th root of unity?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:50:25] primitive root
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:50:33] err
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:50:41] 2^{n-1}
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:51:11] Fangs: I stupidly neglected det
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[20:51:41] johnkeats6: "Second proof", bottom of p.84 here: https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/84/mode/2up
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:51:51] loopspace: I genuinely don't remember enough maths to definitely say this means the highlighted relationship is wrong
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:54:36] w^2 = 1/w^2.. so w^4 = 1, nvm its probably wrong
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:54:51] buster, yeah. it's super cute
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:54:59] johnkeats6: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/be3jxDRh/image.png
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:55:20] loopspace: wikipedia uses [w 0; 0 conj(w)] and [0 -1; 1 0] instead
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:55:31] Yeah, that's the usual way
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:55:51] Rotman does it as above in two books for some reason
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:55:56] buster: Cauchy's theorem has a Wikipedia page, which also has that proof.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	int-e	[20:55:58] Thanks
2021-07-18 04:51:00	johnkeats6	[20:56:05] loopspace, indeed. what's your problem?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:56:41] johnkeats6: from earlier:
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:56:41] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:56:43] loopspace: I think you need to conjugate one of the ws to even have a chance
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:57:06] its probably bad OCR or genuine mistake in the text
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:58:19] It's in another book too, in a slightly different form. Also, the above matches my paper copy. Here's the other https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/voxMN1Is/image.png
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:58:33] am I missing something?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:58:44] Where https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NVu6VDpe/image.png
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[20:58:54] Well, Fangs that was my question
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[20:59:59] .. let me try this again.. det(A) = -(w^2) and det(B) = 1 if I haven't mixed up which diagonals are negative
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:00:25] det(BA inv(B)) = -(w^2)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:00:33] but det(inv(A)) = -1/(w^2)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:01:06] Let w=i. "Generalize"  <jk>
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:01:09] so w^2 = 1/w^2 needs to be true, but this is only true if w^4 = 1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:01:31] so w is 2-th root of unity or 4th root of unity?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:01:59] Yeah, this bugged me. On the other side of the balance was its separate appearance in two separate Rotman books
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:02:21] w is a 2^(n-1)-th root of unity
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:02:48] so for n > 3, it seemed problematic
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:02:48] loopspace: its only true for n < 3, not n >= 3.. I think?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	anovick_	[21:02:50] Anybody knows how to use WolframAlpha to find the limit value of a definite integral defined on a paramter? I tried this but it says time exceeded: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lim%28%28integrate+t%5E2+*arctan%28e%5Et%29+dt+from+0+to+sqrt%28x%29%29+%2F+x%5E%283%2F2%29%29+as+x-%3Einf
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:03:00] off by one, you're right
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:03:12] Fangs: it's hardly be generalized quaternions then
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:03:39] loopspace: I recall someone finding a mistake on rotman's homological algebra book too
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:03:51] idk which book you're reading
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:04:12] Yeah, I've found some mistakes there, and there's an errata sheet,  but this isn't in it. The other books it's in is his group theory book (didn't check others)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:04:24] I'm reading both
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:07:10] I don't remember any mistakes in his alg top book, but that's probably because I couldn't detect any
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:07:37] I couldn't detect any if there are any*
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:07:39] There were some. I didn't keep a list, just fixed them in my paper copy
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:08:19] were they all obvious?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Fangs	[21:08:52] if the GL(2,C) example you showed is indeed wrong, I wouldn't call it as 'obvious'
2021-07-18 04:51:00	loopspace	[21:09:09] For the most part, IIRC. Occasional one which was very confusing for topics that I didn't visit in the past, but easily sorted once I questioned them and looked at another sorce
2021-07-18 04:51:00	buster	[21:09:33] int-e, johnkeats6, loopspace, the original is short and sweet, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2310010

2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:09:52] Fangs try to show that convex functions have well-defined right/left hand derivatives
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:10:03] the convexity condition is more directly applicable to showing this
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tempate	[11:10:10] Fangs: I guess f(x, y, z) = x + 2y + y?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:10:15] then you automatically get right/left continuity
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:10:50] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + 2t^2 + t^3
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:10:57] err
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:11:01] tempate: f(x+y+z) = f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = t + t^2 + t^3
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:11:29] tempate: it might be worth it to just grab dummit and foote and do some of the exercises there
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:11:34] or do some exercises with polynomial rings
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tempate	[11:11:39] in my defense you said w + 2w^2 + w^2
2021-07-18 05:12:19	astronaut	[11:12:16] hi. my school provides a math license which I can activate by connecting to school server. but I don't have the installation file. can someone send me the file. thank you very much.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:12:26]  f(3x+2xy+z^2) = 3f(x) + 2f(x)f(y) + f(z)*f(z) = 3w + 2w*w^2 + w^3 w^3
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:12:34] tempate: you're right, I was wrong
2021-07-18 05:12:19	riv	[11:12:43] a math license? never drink and derive
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:12:50] (I said 3w + 2w^2 + w^2)

2021-07-18 05:12:19	astronaut	[11:13:31] HisShadow, they are asking for wolfram id which I don't have
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:13:53] ok this question makes a billion more sense now "21:05 <tempate> with that example isn't f(x) = w, f(y) = w, and f(z) = w"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tempate	[11:14:17] hehe
2021-07-18 05:12:19	HisShadow	[11:14:20] astronaut: you'll have to ask at your school then

2021-07-18 05:12:19	tempate	[11:15:07] I really appreciate it

2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:17:14] tempate: just hoping to have more math discussion here, esp more on the algebraic side of things
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:18:07] rubiksdream: ugh.. differntiable -> continuous
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:18:20] rubiksdream: ok so differentiability is stupid easy
2021-07-18 05:12:19	astronaut	[11:18:21] don't want to create an ID
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:18:54] feel like I either should be able to show it immediately, or I would need to sit down and try to prove differentiable -> cts
2021-07-18 05:12:19	HisShadow	[11:19:21] astronaut: I found this on the sign in page: "You can use your Wolfram ID or organization email."

2021-07-18 05:12:19	astronaut	[11:21:45] seems like there is no way to get Mathematica installer without creating an ID or getting viruses from torrent.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:22:51] Fangs convex functions aren't necessarily differentiable, but what is true is that they have left/right hand derivatives
2021-07-18 05:12:19	zacts	[11:23:10] I'm trying to understand Calculus a bit.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:23:39] but in essence what you are saying is the argument, except with 'differentiable -> continuous' replaced with ' left derivative exists -> left continuous' (and the same with left replaced with right)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:24:05] so left/right derivative existing is easy, you just need to notice that the limits in question are monotone (and bounded below/above_
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:24:08] is |x| convex?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:24:17] or maybe -|x|
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:24:27] yes it is certainly convex
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:24:33] |x|
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:24:52] -|x| is concave
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:24:54] ok, the derivative doesnt exists at 0, left and right is 1 and -1 I think. so thats a counter example for what you said
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:25:08] or an affirmative example rather
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:25:18] its an affirmative example
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:25:24] so the opposite of a counterexample
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:25:30] yeah its getting late here, sorry :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[11:25:30] an example
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:25:41] no worries
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:26:02] anyway, convex basically means increasing secants
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[11:26:11] anticountermeasure
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:26:39] so you can use that to show left/right hand derivatives exist: let h > 0  , and suppose h is decreasing to 0 (staying positive), then f(x+h) - f(x)/h is decreasing and is bounded below
2021-07-18 05:12:19	zacts	[11:26:49] I'm trying to understand how Calculus can be used as a tool within a context.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:26:53] similarly for h<0 and h increasing, f(x+h)-f(x)/h is increasing and bounded above
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:26:59] so both limits exist
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:27:24] I'll copy paste this convo and reread it in the morning
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:28:11] now the trick to showing right differentiable -> right continuous is: [f(x+h)-f(x)/h]*h -> 0 as h->0 from above, because [f(x+h)-f(x)/h] is bounded near 0 from above
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:28:21] and you do the exact same thing for left continuity
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:31:10] rubiksdream: let x, y in (a,b). assume x <= y I was thinking the other day that maybe I want this two picture (x+a)/2 --- x --- (x+y)/2 to get (____?) and to look at x --- (x+y)/2 --- y to get a lower bound on f(y)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:31:21] (I think the former was to get an upper bound on f(x))
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:31:35] then do a comparison, but I have to assume f(x) - f(y) > 0 here
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[11:32:21] yeah the general idea sounds something like what you would do
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:32:51] I'll have to actually finish the proof to see if it'll work
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:33:16] rubiksdream: my difficulty was i kept using the convexivity to end up with f(stuff) <= stuff f(x) + stuff f(y)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:33:27] and I spend a few days trying to "incoperate" delta into stuff
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:34:02] maybe if delta > 1, choose t to be 1/delta or something stupid like that (for that t f(x) + (1-t) f(y))
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:34:43] then I let t_x = t_x a + (1-t_x) b, same for y.. then I got bounds that are constants.. except f(a) and f(b) might not be defined
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:35:45] I think me doing analysis is just entirely an exercise in pain
2021-07-18 05:12:19	zacts	[11:36:05] I'm looking for stuff to tinker Calculus with a bit. Altho, I kind of like discrete mathematics a bit right now.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[11:36:17] anyway I'm heading off, I saved the convo in a text paste, might poke you tomorrow so I'll apologize now beforehand
2021-07-18 05:12:19	zacts	[12:02:57] I want to work thru this book eventually: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241408.Introduction_to_Analytic_Number_Theory
2021-07-18 05:12:19	kmh	[12:04:55] that's the spirit
2021-07-18 05:12:19	riv	[12:06:33] zacts, yes that is a good book
2021-07-18 05:12:19	riv	[12:06:47] i think there was a reading group for it here
2021-07-18 05:12:19	zacts	[12:06:50] I haven't begun analysis yet tho.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[12:12:43] There is a channel for studying Apostol here, #offbeat
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[12:48:14] tempate: not sure if you'll read this but I think we should read ahead of the exercises. the language provided in the subsequent section are usually useful for the problem in previous chapters
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[12:49:56] 1.5, Proposition 1 says an algebraic set is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tempate	[14:00:02] Fangs: I had read that but forgotten. It's usually only after exercises that I remember stuff.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	biberao	[14:05:14] hi
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Daemonick	[14:31:41] Math teachers can be divided in two classes: those who can count and those who cannot
2021-07-18 05:12:19	drazak	[14:32:34] it's funnier if you say three classes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	drazak	[14:32:35] :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Daemonick	[14:34:04] Well and those who can verify the result of computers
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:36:00] someone give me a clue please? https://ibb.co/zPXDFdG (from Sontz, An Introductory Path to Quantum Theory)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:41:48] ae-bd=1 ... I smell SU(2)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:43:24] you can add "• it's got d, e and f on the left-hand side"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[14:44:51] why is C^2 called the complex plane.. lol
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:46:10] ha, yeah. not the Gauss plane, not the Riemann plane
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[14:47:11] yeah its like they used the one phrase reserved for C
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:47:15] that smell was probably SL(2)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:48:07] acrid
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Panther	[14:48:51] I was just struck by the geometric interpretation that pi is transcendental. It's not Earth-shattering, but it did strike me as another odd thing you can't do.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[14:49:20] what does [a,b] mean?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	 *	Panther [14:49:27] shrugs
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rubiksdream	[14:49:37] i meant for busters thing
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Panther	[14:49:42] Give a context.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Panther	[14:49:47] oh..
2021-07-18 05:12:19	 *	Panther [14:49:53] goes back to shrugging.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:50:26] ab-ba. (p and q are operators, on a yet-to-be defined space of functions \psi:C->C. p is (\hbar/i)(\partial/\partial x). x is multiplication by x.)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:50:37] p and *x
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[14:53:47] What's the meaning of what you write after "We can write..."?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:54:13] it's very stupid, please pretend you didn't see it.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[14:54:14] You essentially found the answer after ae-bd=1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[14:54:47] The answer has a form similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[14:57:49] hmm. i did wonder if some sort of homogenization would help, to get affine transformations in there, and maybe fix the dimensionality. i notice he doesn't say it's a group of linear transformations.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[14:58:55] You can realize it a subgroup of SL(3, C) if you want
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[15:07:01] doh. was thinking I need to change (a,b,c) to (d,e,f). but no, (1,0,0,0,1,0) changes to (a,b,c,d,e,f), some of which are redundant. or something
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[15:09:36] What does "transform a, b, c into ..." mean? a, b, c are coefficients of the transformation
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[15:09:58] You transform p, x into p', x'
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Franciman	[15:14:33] Hey all
2021-07-18 05:12:19	HenryTheLongshot	[15:18:04] Hey
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[15:18:41] right, thanks cherim_
2021-07-18 05:12:19	biberao	[15:44:57] buster: rex: busted his jaw while fighting
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[16:11:15] hi
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:17:08] hi johnkeats6
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[16:18:14] Hi. Really fun thing I learned recently. By AC-magic, we previously knew that there exists a partition of R^3 into disjoint unit circles (so each set in the partition is congruent to {(x,y,0) : x^2 + y^2 = 1} ). The new wrinkle, that I never would have imagined possible, is that you can do the same thing but where no two circles in the partition are "linked" through each other.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[16:21:55] Cute. The argument is virtually unchanged...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[16:22:45] Hmm. Oh, no.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[16:24:04] But naturally there are lots of pairs of them where one has a portion poking past the disk bounded by the other... just not in a linking way.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	rak	[16:24:37] This the proof you're talking about? https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/13850
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[16:25:06] yes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[16:37:15] buster, what's up
2021-07-18 05:12:19	anovick_	[16:38:20] Hey guys, I'm trying to understand how to calculate some integral with arctan(x) in it. I found a solution but I don't understand the substitution step. could somebody help with this? https://imgur.com/40FACNX.png
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[16:39:29] Z-module: Ah, that's a really neat restriction of admissible circles.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[16:40:52] anovick_: integration by parts
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[16:41:06] yeah, so all the circles end up being in vertical planes. Naively it feels *impossible* you can make a partition like that.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:42:05] johnkeats6: trying an exercise from Sontz' quantum theory book, and failing
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:42:17] how you doing?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[16:42:25] tipsy
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[16:42:29] which exercise
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[16:43:26] Also int-e, even though I know what it says more or less, I really want to get hold of the paper in his reference 5, from the old Georgian SSR Academy of Science. I can't find this anywhere. (plus I wish the English name of that country/SSR were not "Georgia" -- it's very confusing for US folks)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[16:44:38] I've seen enough instances of proposition 1.3 that I'm over the fact that these results are usually counterintuitive. :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	biberao	[16:45:06] A guy here asked for a degree in quantum computing
2021-07-18 05:12:19	biberao	[16:45:22] we dont have those degrees maybe a master or something
2021-07-18 05:12:19	anovick_	[16:45:33] loopspace: oh I see now, thank you! I didn't know about this but it's in my book so I should use it
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[16:45:38] So it's "just" the restriction of candidate circles that is the tricky part.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[16:45:43] Yeah. ANother fun such application is: There's a collection X of (infinite) lines in the plane so that every point of the plane is on exactly two lines from X, and no two lines from X are parallel.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:46:06] johnkeats, 5.2.3, https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:47:33] cherim_ has given me some help, but it hasn't clicked yet
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:47:52] the blurry bit was basically gibberish
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[16:48:22] It's not help, you probably aren't on the same wavelength with the author
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[17:47:22] particle-wave duality
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[17:47:23] lol
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[17:58:10] *thought
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[18:03:38] why unify ?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[18:07:44] if the solution is in creating fiction with half working math (or none at all on close inspection) and danger of more confusion i'd rather stick to the mosaic
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[18:08:07] erm, sorry
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:08:09] it seems my ignore list is empty, so i don't quite understand what is going on
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Inline	[18:10:14] taeaad: that was not to you with your rock stuff
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[18:10:41] Oh, OK.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:11:25] people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[18:11:29] Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:12:54] acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-18 05:12:19	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[18:24:00] Z-module: (in addition to restricting to vertical planes)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[18:24:10] anyway, it's neat how merely a well-ordering of R (or of R^3 or of all the circles in R^3, same thing) is what enables all of this, without having to use c = aleph_1. There are other types of magic constructions where you do need CH.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:24:18] johnkeats6: mornfall which one is it?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:24:54] acresearch: let me try a different way… you have surely heard of mapreduce?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:25:07] mornfall: no
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:25:15] damn
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:25:27] mornfall: sorry
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Z-module	[18:25:45] Like my very favorite equivalent of CH:   CH  iff  There exists a single function f:R -> R so that the plane is the union of countably many sets, where each set is either some translate of the graph of f, or a translate of that graph rotated by pi/2 radians.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:26:15] acresearch: compute the sum of squared errors (don't take the square root) of each sub-list, sum up those, then take the root
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:26:57] acresearch: (don't divide by the number of elements either… think about how you would compute the mean of all the values instead, without loading them all into ram)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:26:58] mornfall: ok 1 moment let me code it
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[18:32:34] johnkeats6, cherim_, with two of the typos fixed, http://mathb.in/60918 . in the first section, the images T(p), T(x) *aren't even in* my 2D space :/
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:34:51] What you struggle with has no specifics of non-commutativity or operators or physics
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:35:26] Actions of a linear transformation on vectors and on coordinates of vectors are different
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:35:49] Given by mutual transposes in terms of matrix elements
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:36:54] If you rewrite the last example (2D affine) in terms of what Te_x, Te_y are for coordinate orts e_x, e_y, you'll get the top matrix
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:38:55] mornfall: ok i tried your method, but i get a totally different number
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:39:20] Or yo can say that your (Weyl) algebra is parametrized by X*x+Y*p+Z*1 and describe transformations in terms of (X', Y', Z')=T(X, Y, Z)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:39:33] That will transpose the top form into bottom form
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:42:26] acresearch: you did the 1/N and the square root at the end, right?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:43:30] mornfall: N= total number of points in all lists right?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:43:36] sure
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:44:17] mornfall: ok i coded it,   but still very different number
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:44:23] first you sum everything in all lists and divide by N to get μ
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:44:34] mornfall: yes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:45:23] then you compute the sum of (xᵢ - μ)² for each list, add those sums together, divide by N, take a square root
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[18:45:30] thanks cherim_. (coordinate orts? is that a typo? coordinates wrt?)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:45:36] make sure you don't overflow something
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:45:59] those are going to be some big numbers
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:47:20] mornfall: yes,   want to see my code?   it is crappy but follow these steps
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:47:39] Suppose you have a linear map T:R^3 ->R^3. You can define it by Te_1 = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3,  Te_2 = a' e_1 + b' e_2 + c' e_3, Te_3 = a'' e_1 + b'' e_2 + c'' e_3
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:47:46] then you are probably overflowing… consider import fractions if this is python
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[18:48:15] yep.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:48:16] Then T gets a "matrix" with coordinates a, b, c, a', ...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:49:07] mornfall: what do you mean?    here is my code: https://paste.debian.net/1204700/
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:49:15] You can also define the same transformation by saying that a vector with coordinates (x1, x2, x3) is mapped to (Ax1+Bx2+Cx3, A'x1+B'x2+C'x3, A''x1+B''x2+C''x3)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:49:36] Where the coordinates are as in v=x1 e1+x2 e2+x3 e3
2021-07-18 05:12:19	taeaad	[18:49:54] joel135: I think they are an alternative of sorts to a topological space.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:50:00] Then you get another matrix with entries A, B, C, A', ...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:50:03] acresearch: uhh, what?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:50:12] How is it related to the one with entries a, b, c, a'...?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:50:20] acresearch: mean = statistics.stdev(…)?

2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:50:32] oh wait
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:50:37] dam   i mixed them up
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:50:43] acresearch: also you are not even close to doing what i told you to do
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:51:09] mornfall: i calcualted the standard error right?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:51:26] acresearch: you are calculating a bunch of nonsense, tbh…

2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:51:57] mornfall: ok let me go back and see how to calculate the standard error, i might have seen the wrong article
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:52:18] acresearch: just do what i told you to do, there isn't anything else to it, really
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[18:52:19] (a b c)^T = (A A' A'')^T, and so on. they are mutually transpose.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:52:28] In you mathbin paste the same happens. p, x, 1 are basis vectors of a Weyl algebra. Not coordinates. As I said, they can't be numbers already by noncommutativity
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:52:50] Like e1, e2, e3
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:53:19] So no wonder you get transposes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:53:30] mornfall: calculate sum of error for each list, add all sum of errors, divide by N, sqrt  right?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:53:58] acresearch: yes, notice the part where you need the mean of the entire dataset for that
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:54:10] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:54:10] can't just take the mean of the sublist
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:54:24] mornfall: wait,   i am confused now
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:54:54] mornfall: no when calculating the standard error  i value-mean   where mean is of the while dataset?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:55:57] acresearch: for l in [X1, X2, X3]: { means.append(sum(l)); lens.append(len(l)) } ; mean = sum(sums)/sum(lens) ;
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[18:56:06] To be honest, if you are reading a physics book on "operators and canonical quantization" and try to interpret momentum and coordinate as numbers (simultaneously) in the exercises section, the book is not that good
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:56:21] acresearch: as i have explicitly said before… sum _all_ the data points and divide by the size of the entire data set
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[18:56:50] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:57:10] acresearch: you are probably going to run into precision problems with floats
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[18:57:44] acresearch: you might want to ask someone more qualified to do this for you :\
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[18:58:39] mornfall: probably,  either way i am not getting the excpeted final SD,,, so i guess the closest approach is to just calculate the SD of each sub list and take a mean of all the SDs
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:00:56] acresearch: you are going to get random garbage
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:01:30] mornfall: there is no alternative, i think your approach works, but... i still need the mean of the whole database, which i cannot get because i cannot import it
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:01:49] *sigh*
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:01:59] mornfall: dealing with data larger than what a supercomputer can handel is frustrating :-(
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:02:13] i literally wrote that part of the program for you
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:02:21] mornfall: which did not work
2021-07-18 05:12:19	fweht	[19:02:33] im a bit confused why these maps F^f_t act on C^\infty(\mathbf{R}^{2n}) as opposed to directly on \mathbf{R}^{2n}? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CYruQnst/image.png
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:02:38] did you try it?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:02:48] to get the _mean_
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:02:50] mornfall: yes   one moment i will paste my code
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:04:46] mornfall: https://paste.debian.net/1204702/
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:06:00] acresearch: you messed up where the loop ends; the mean is obviously computed after the loop, not inside
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:06:09] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:08:26] mornfall: ok that gives me the final mean correctly
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:09:07] of course it does
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:09:53] mornfall: so then what about the final SD?   you said my code is wrong, which part?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[19:11:42] cherim_, i don't doubt you, but i don't follow what you're saying. in my paste, in the first section, p and x are always vectors (elements of the vector space, in this case an algebra), never coordinates. I abused the same letter T for the matrix (with respect to the basis {p,x,1} for a subspace) and the underlying linear transformation.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:14:24] acresearch: i already pointed that out
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:15:26] mornfall:  i fixed it, i still do not get the same number
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:16:14] then you probably didn't fix it right
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:16:55] mornfall: you can see my fix in the last code i sent you      final SD = 1.82  i got 1.59
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[19:16:55] What is your question about the exercise then? Are there any remaining?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mornfall	[19:17:07] (your last paste still uses the wrong mean)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:17:26] mornfall: ah   of each list    ok   let me fix that
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:18:14] mornfall: ok got a closer value    final SD = 1.82  i got 1.75
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[19:18:50] I understood that you don't like that 1) bottom 3x3 is the transpose of the top, 2) that Tp was not in the span <x, p> or some "2D space"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[19:19:33] cherim_, I'll work on it. probably as soon as I can formulate a question that makes sense, I'll be able to answer it. I appreciate your efforts
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[19:20:02] The first is answered (but it's not even very important since groups tructures are isomorphic), the second is inconsistent with the meaning of p, x
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[19:20:28] p'=ap+bx+c in the statement is already not in a "2D space"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[19:20:49] Since RHS is a combination of 3 linearly independent objects
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[19:21:59] Well, technically you can glue 1 and one of (p, x) by "fixing a representation as coordinate/momentum". But it's better left untouched
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[19:22:12] acresearch: one subtle detail is that stdev() divides by (n-1), where n is the sample size; so it's the usual unbiased estimator for the standard deviation.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[19:22:40] mm. i suppose i'm misinterpreting the other part of the question, where it asks for a group of symmetries of the complex 'plane' C^2.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[19:23:10] acresearch: But this whole computation is rather intricate. https://paste.debian.net/1204705/  seems to work
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:24:28] int-e: ok i have to go have dinner, i opened your paste, is it ok to look at it in 2 hour when i return?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	acresearch	[19:24:41] int-e: thank you for your input,    and mornfall thank you for your help too :-)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[19:25:21] you don't need my permission... I may not be around then, don't know yet
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[19:26:53] If I had to type this exercise, I'd first identify the automorphisms as a subgroup of SL(3, C) as you did, and only then note that the result is the same as complexification of area-preserving affine transformations
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cherim_	[19:27:47] (in 2dimensions)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[19:28:46] ah. that word 'represent'. (<https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS>). I only need a homomorphism. I don't need a physical intuition of what the 2D thing is.

2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[19:34:45] Daemonick: wtf
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Daemonick	[19:35:11] Archive - Londinium
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[19:35:24] fine
2021-07-18 05:12:19	greenbagels	[19:40:40] a mute for posting a music playlist?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[19:42:57] yes please
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:01:50] buster, i think you're overcomplicating it
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:02:11] you have affine area-preserving maps, that's all the exercise asks you to reealize
2021-07-18 05:12:19	kenthurley	[20:26:25] Are there finite groups of the same cardinality but "completely unisomorphic"?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:28:52] kenthurley: there are two distinct (nonisomorphic) groups of size 4.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:29:26] C_4 and K_4 = C_2^2, where C_n is the cyclic group of order n.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:30:01] (that "the" is justified by considering groups up to isomorphism; take it with a grain of salt)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:34:58] johnkeats6, i'm sure! but now i'm worried about the transpose stuff cherim_ explained. i don't think my linear algebra is *that* lacking. i think i just failed to communicate what i meant. but i'm worried.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:35:51] here's a very belaboured version of an answer, no doubt still full of typos, but emphasizing the transposition as a feature not a bug: https://ibb.co/9sj6zBK
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:36:03] may it be even less fun to read than it was to write :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:36:36] buster, well, if you have a basis e_1, ..., e_n you can think of the 'coordinates' x_1, ..., x_n as really the dual basis, so that's where the transposing is coming from
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:36:47] oh man. i know! :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	kenthurley	[20:37:35] int-e: thank you for example, although I knew about it. For clarity, I'm on purpose asking about "completely unisomorphic". That is, something like for any bijection f between groups we would have f(xy)=f(x)f(y) for nothing except x=e or y=e. Well, that is not fully formal, but something like that
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:37:48] (C^3)^* !! :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:38:10] hopefully you won't be offended if i don't read it :p
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:38:31] i'm cut to the quick
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:40:46] kenthurley: no such group exists
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:40:53]  kenthurley: well, in any two such groups you'll have non-trivial isomorphic subgroups
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:41:15] kenthurley: if you require it for *any* bijection between groups, you can always send e in H to any non-identity element g in G
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:43:16] kenthurley: If p is a prime factor of |G| then G has a subgroup ismorphic to C_p. It's a corollary of the Sylow theorems (is there a more elementary proof without them?)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:43:40] yes, it's called cauchy's theorem
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:43:50] there's a cute proof
2021-07-18 05:12:19	newpy	[20:44:44] how many ways are there to arrange 3 distinguishable balls in 3 buckets?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:44:45] Frobenius, 1884
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:44:49] loopspace: still wondering about your question?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:45:22] Sure
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:45:48] newpy: are they distinguishable buckets?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	newpy	[20:45:56] int-e, yes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:46:13] so, for each ball, pick a bucket...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	newpy	[20:46:29] int-e, 4^3?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:46:36] 3^3 as you wrote it
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:46:58] it was something like: take the set of p-uples (g_1, ..., g_p) such that g_1 ... g_p = e, and let Z_p act on this by cyclically permuting this tuple.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	newpy	[20:47:10] int-e, whoops, so if we had 4 balls in 3 buckets?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:47:14] that's the one. Exercise 1.10, https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/14/mode/2up
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:47:20] newpy: then 3^4
2021-07-18 05:12:19	newpy	[20:47:21] 3^4?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:47:48] loopspace what's a^-1?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:48:10] a fixed point of this action is an element of order p
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:48:13] ah, they didn't do the bit where you extend it to non-abelian groups
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:48:17] Typo A^-1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:48:25] Presumably
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:48:56] loopspace: det A is -(w^2) right?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:49:06] det b is 1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:49:23] so det inv(A) should be -1/(w^2)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:49:48] and, uh, let me remember
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:49:55] was it orbit stabilizer?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:50:13] Fangs: herp derp. Thx
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:50:23] loopspace: is w^2 = 1/w^2? if w is the (2^{n} - 1)-th root of unity?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:50:25] primitive root
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:50:33] err
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:50:41] 2^{n-1}
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:51:11] Fangs: I stupidly neglected det
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[20:51:41] johnkeats6: "Second proof", bottom of p.84 here: https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/84/mode/2up
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:51:51] loopspace: I genuinely don't remember enough maths to definitely say this means the highlighted relationship is wrong
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:54:36] w^2 = 1/w^2.. so w^4 = 1, nvm its probably wrong
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:54:51] buster, yeah. it's super cute
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:54:59] johnkeats6: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/be3jxDRh/image.png
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:55:20] loopspace: wikipedia uses [w 0; 0 conj(w)] and [0 -1; 1 0] instead
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:55:31] Yeah, that's the usual way
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:55:51] Rotman does it as above in two books for some reason
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:55:56] buster: Cauchy's theorem has a Wikipedia page, which also has that proof.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	int-e	[20:55:58] Thanks
2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[20:56:05] loopspace, indeed. what's your problem?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:56:41] johnkeats6: from earlier:
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:56:41] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:56:43] loopspace: I think you need to conjugate one of the ws to even have a chance
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:57:06] its probably bad OCR or genuine mistake in the text
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:58:19] It's in another book too, in a slightly different form. Also, the above matches my paper copy. Here's the other https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/voxMN1Is/image.png
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:58:33] am I missing something?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:58:44] Where https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NVu6VDpe/image.png
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[20:58:54] Well, Fangs that was my question
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[20:59:59] .. let me try this again.. det(A) = -(w^2) and det(B) = 1 if I haven't mixed up which diagonals are negative
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:00:25] det(BA inv(B)) = -(w^2)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:00:33] but det(inv(A)) = -1/(w^2)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:01:06] Let w=i. "Generalize"  <jk>
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:01:09] so w^2 = 1/w^2 needs to be true, but this is only true if w^4 = 1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:01:31] so w is 2-th root of unity or 4th root of unity?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:01:59] Yeah, this bugged me. On the other side of the balance was its separate appearance in two separate Rotman books
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:02:21] w is a 2^(n-1)-th root of unity
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:02:48] so for n > 3, it seemed problematic
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:02:48] loopspace: its only true for n < 3, not n >= 3.. I think?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	anovick_	[21:02:50] Anybody knows how to use WolframAlpha to find the limit value of a definite integral defined on a paramter? I tried this but it says time exceeded: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lim%28%28integrate+t%5E2+*arctan%28e%5Et%29+dt+from+0+to+sqrt%28x%29%29+%2F+x%5E%283%2F2%29%29+as+x-%3Einf
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:03:00] off by one, you're right
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:03:12] Fangs: it's hardly be generalized quaternions then
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:03:39] loopspace: I recall someone finding a mistake on rotman's homological algebra book too
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:03:51] idk which book you're reading
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:04:12] Yeah, I've found some mistakes there, and there's an errata sheet,  but this isn't in it. The other books it's in is his group theory book (didn't check others)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:04:24] I'm reading both
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:07:10] I don't remember any mistakes in his alg top book, but that's probably because I couldn't detect any
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:07:37] I couldn't detect any if there are any*
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:07:39] There were some. I didn't keep a list, just fixed them in my paper copy
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:08:19] were they all obvious?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Fangs	[21:08:52] if the GL(2,C) example you showed is indeed wrong, I wouldn't call it as 'obvious'
2021-07-18 05:12:19	loopspace	[21:09:09] For the most part, IIRC. Occasional one which was very confusing for topics that I didn't visit in the past, but easily sorted once I questioned them and looked at another sorce

2021-07-18 05:12:19	johnkeats6	[23:20:37] it's just a fancy schmancy diagonalization
2021-07-18 05:12:19	buster	[23:25:43] if you've sent something to negative imaginary infinity and then thought of it intuitively as infintesimal this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways

2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[16:48:41] i don't get it. haven't you solved it?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[16:48:44] corollary: probably not same frequency either
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[16:48:59] He would ask "so what aren't you satisfied with in your solution?"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[16:50:04] you could say the group of symmetries is like SL(2, C) x| C^2 (i guess) if you wanna be fancy
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[16:51:17] Where's the group of symmetries? I'm sort of nearly there. It's the subgroup of the affine group with ae-bd=1. But if I knew exactly what I meant by that, I would have written it down already :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[16:51:18] Physicists would probably prefer a direct embedding into SL(3, C) as (a b c // d e f // 0 0 1) with the only constraint det=1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[16:52:10] SL(2, C) x| C^2  is more Poincare group style, also OK
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[16:52:19] perhaps a silly question, but what's the 3d vector space there?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[16:52:31] buster, the linear part is an action of SL(2, C), and the affine part is any translation, so i believe it's SL(2, C) x| C^2
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[16:52:36] (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[16:52:54] Standard way to cast affine as linear
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[16:54:11] cherim_, i know of it. I'll have another try, thanks
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[16:54:18] Z-module: do we know whether any of these results *requires* AC? (We basically know for Banach-Tarski because of the work on the Axiom of determinacy)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[16:55:36] he says identify as a group of symmetry of C^2 so he probably wants the semi-direct product
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[16:57:43] just saying mp+nx maps to (a+d+c/p)p + (b+e+f/x)x and showing it's invertible is probably ok. the prerequisites for this book are pretty light.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[16:57:54] ugh. or whatever.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[16:59:19] What does division by p even mean
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[17:00:27] is it so bad? c is a momentum, p is a nonzero momentum in the same direction ... call p "1 kg m s^-1", for example
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[17:01:09] What mathematical object is p so that you can divide by it? Clearly not just a number since p and x do not commute
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[17:01:48] ok
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:01:56] yeah i wouldn't worry too much about this exercise. this non-commutative geometry stuff is esoteric :>
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:02:16] learn the harmonic oscillator carefully, that's the most important thing in the book
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[17:02:17] You can look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512169.pdf to reconsider maybe
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[17:02:49] B-T definitely requires it since at least two of the B-T subsets must be non-measurable. I don't know if this congruent-circles things requires it. THere are (relatively) explicit parititions into different-size circles, though.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[17:06:47] [<cherim_> (p, x, 1) -> (p', x', 1)] does that work? are they vectors of operators?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[17:07:36] Elements of some algebra
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[17:07:57] Can view as operators if you want (in down-to-earth physics style)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:09:39] buster, you're interpreting the action as if it were an action of C^2 (or C^3 if you want), even though p, x are really operators
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:09:48] s/of/on/
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:16:41] Is there a theorem that says a torus has a shorter distance going through the hole that around it?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:16:47] Or is that by definion?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[17:17:44] you mean, you pick two points on the torus and want to find the shortest route between them?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	tempate	[17:19:08] taeaad: I guess it would depend on how high and how wide the torus is?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[17:24:23] https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2180608/walking-on-a-torus-minimum-distance ...the last link http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf looks interesting, it has some nice pictures
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:25:58] yeah geodesics on a round torus are complicated
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:26:04] they are very simple on a flat torus tho....
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:26:06] :>
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[17:28:06] taeaad: taking a more simple-minded guess at what your question is, if the torus is constructed as a surface of revolution, from this sort of arrangement: https://ibb.co/jwDK4bg ... then r < R iff the torus doesn't intersect itself
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mnhrdt	[17:29:37] Consider d:R^n->R^(n^2) the "diagonal" map that puts a vector on the diagonal of a matrix.  Where can I read about the formal properties of d?  Such as d(x)y=d(y)x, d(d(x)y)=... d(Ax)y=...
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mnhrdt	[17:30:14] does it even have a name?  I'm using this stupid notation everyday and I think i'm reinventing the wheel
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[17:32:48] d(x)y  = d(y)x = the coordinatewise product of x and y, right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[17:33:14] i.e. the product in the direct-product ring R^n
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mnhrdt	[17:33:41] Z-module: yes, the point-wise product, written x.*y in octave/matlab
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[17:33:47] not sure what you mean by Ax
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:33:52] people write diag
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mnhrdt	[17:33:56] A is an nxn matrix
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:34:07] well, diag(a, b, c, d, ...) is the diagonal matrix with diagonal a, b, c, d, ...
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mnhrdt	[17:35:04] yes, "diag", but it's too long, I have mammooth expressions with "diag" and I feel I'm doing something wrong
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:38:10] buster, i don't remember if i recommended looking at singer's 'symmetry and prediction in the hydrogen atom' but it's also a nice book about basic QM from a math perspective
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Inline	[17:38:30] aww man
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:39:22] buster: Right, that makes sense.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[17:39:29] :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[17:39:38] thanks johnkeats6, i'll put it on the list
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.

2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:47:33] I mean, artists spend their whole life potentially making shitty art.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:47:53] We spend our whole life pointlessly breathing, too.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Inline	[17:51:19] shitty interpretations and fusions of concepts on steroids
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.

2021-07-18 16:36:23	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Inline	[18:07:44] if the solution is in creating fiction with half working math (or none at all on close inspection) and danger of more confusion i'd rather stick to the mosaic
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Inline	[18:08:07] erm, sorry
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:08:09] it seems my ignore list is empty, so i don't quite understand what is going on
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Inline	[18:10:14] taeaad: that was not to you with your rock stuff
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[18:10:41] Oh, OK.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:11:25] people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[18:11:29] Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:12:54] acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-18 16:36:23	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[18:24:00] Z-module: (in addition to restricting to vertical planes)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[18:24:10] anyway, it's neat how merely a well-ordering of R (or of R^3 or of all the circles in R^3, same thing) is what enables all of this, without having to use c = aleph_1. There are other types of magic constructions where you do need CH.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:24:18] johnkeats6: mornfall which one is it?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:24:54] acresearch: let me try a different way… you have surely heard of mapreduce?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:25:07] mornfall: no
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:25:15] damn
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:25:27] mornfall: sorry
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Z-module	[18:25:45] Like my very favorite equivalent of CH:   CH  iff  There exists a single function f:R -> R so that the plane is the union of countably many sets, where each set is either some translate of the graph of f, or a translate of that graph rotated by pi/2 radians.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:26:15] acresearch: compute the sum of squared errors (don't take the square root) of each sub-list, sum up those, then take the root
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:26:57] acresearch: (don't divide by the number of elements either… think about how you would compute the mean of all the values instead, without loading them all into ram)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:26:58] mornfall: ok 1 moment let me code it
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[18:32:34] johnkeats6, cherim_, with two of the typos fixed, http://mathb.in/60918 . in the first section, the images T(p), T(x) *aren't even in* my 2D space :/
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:34:51] What you struggle with has no specifics of non-commutativity or operators or physics
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:35:26] Actions of a linear transformation on vectors and on coordinates of vectors are different
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:35:49] Given by mutual transposes in terms of matrix elements
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:36:54] If you rewrite the last example (2D affine) in terms of what Te_x, Te_y are for coordinate orts e_x, e_y, you'll get the top matrix
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:38:55] mornfall: ok i tried your method, but i get a totally different number
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:39:20] Or yo can say that your (Weyl) algebra is parametrized by X*x+Y*p+Z*1 and describe transformations in terms of (X', Y', Z')=T(X, Y, Z)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:39:33] That will transpose the top form into bottom form
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:42:26] acresearch: you did the 1/N and the square root at the end, right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:43:30] mornfall: N= total number of points in all lists right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:43:36] sure
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:44:17] mornfall: ok i coded it,   but still very different number
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:44:23] first you sum everything in all lists and divide by N to get μ
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:44:34] mornfall: yes
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:45:23] then you compute the sum of (xᵢ - μ)² for each list, add those sums together, divide by N, take a square root
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[18:45:30] thanks cherim_. (coordinate orts? is that a typo? coordinates wrt?)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:45:36] make sure you don't overflow something
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:45:59] those are going to be some big numbers
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:47:20] mornfall: yes,   want to see my code?   it is crappy but follow these steps
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:47:39] Suppose you have a linear map T:R^3 ->R^3. You can define it by Te_1 = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3,  Te_2 = a' e_1 + b' e_2 + c' e_3, Te_3 = a'' e_1 + b'' e_2 + c'' e_3
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:47:46] then you are probably overflowing… consider import fractions if this is python
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[18:48:15] yep.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:48:16] Then T gets a "matrix" with coordinates a, b, c, a', ...
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:49:07] mornfall: what do you mean?    here is my code: https://paste.debian.net/1204700/
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:49:15] You can also define the same transformation by saying that a vector with coordinates (x1, x2, x3) is mapped to (Ax1+Bx2+Cx3, A'x1+B'x2+C'x3, A''x1+B''x2+C''x3)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:49:36] Where the coordinates are as in v=x1 e1+x2 e2+x3 e3
2021-07-18 16:36:23	taeaad	[18:49:54] joel135: I think they are an alternative of sorts to a topological space.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:50:00] Then you get another matrix with entries A, B, C, A', ...
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:50:03] acresearch: uhh, what?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:50:12] How is it related to the one with entries a, b, c, a'...?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:50:20] acresearch: mean = statistics.stdev(…)?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:50:28] mornfall: is it not?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:50:32] oh wait
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:50:37] dam   i mixed them up
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:50:43] acresearch: also you are not even close to doing what i told you to do
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:51:09] mornfall: i calcualted the standard error right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:51:26] acresearch: you are calculating a bunch of nonsense, tbh…
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:51:32] mornfall: hmmmm
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:51:57] mornfall: ok let me go back and see how to calculate the standard error, i might have seen the wrong article
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:52:18] acresearch: just do what i told you to do, there isn't anything else to it, really
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[18:52:19] (a b c)^T = (A A' A'')^T, and so on. they are mutually transpose.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:52:28] In you mathbin paste the same happens. p, x, 1 are basis vectors of a Weyl algebra. Not coordinates. As I said, they can't be numbers already by noncommutativity
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:52:50] Like e1, e2, e3
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:53:19] So no wonder you get transposes
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:53:30] mornfall: calculate sum of error for each list, add all sum of errors, divide by N, sqrt  right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:53:58] acresearch: yes, notice the part where you need the mean of the entire dataset for that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:54:10] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:54:10] can't just take the mean of the sublist
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:54:24] mornfall: wait,   i am confused now
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:54:54] mornfall: no when calculating the standard error  i value-mean   where mean is of the while dataset?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:55:57] acresearch: for l in [X1, X2, X3]: { means.append(sum(l)); lens.append(len(l)) } ; mean = sum(sums)/sum(lens) ;
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[18:56:06] To be honest, if you are reading a physics book on "operators and canonical quantization" and try to interpret momentum and coordinate as numbers (simultaneously) in the exercises section, the book is not that good
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:56:21] acresearch: as i have explicitly said before… sum _all_ the data points and divide by the size of the entire data set
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[18:56:50] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:57:10] acresearch: you are probably going to run into precision problems with floats
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[18:57:44] acresearch: you might want to ask someone more qualified to do this for you :\
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[18:58:39] mornfall: probably,  either way i am not getting the excpeted final SD,,, so i guess the closest approach is to just calculate the SD of each sub list and take a mean of all the SDs
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:00:56] acresearch: you are going to get random garbage
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:01:30] mornfall: there is no alternative, i think your approach works, but... i still need the mean of the whole database, which i cannot get because i cannot import it
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:01:49] *sigh*
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:01:59] mornfall: dealing with data larger than what a supercomputer can handel is frustrating :-(
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:02:13] i literally wrote that part of the program for you
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:02:21] mornfall: which did not work
2021-07-18 16:36:23	fweht	[19:02:33] im a bit confused why these maps F^f_t act on C^\infty(\mathbf{R}^{2n}) as opposed to directly on \mathbf{R}^{2n}? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CYruQnst/image.png
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:02:38] did you try it?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:02:48] to get the _mean_
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:02:50] mornfall: yes   one moment i will paste my code
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:04:46] mornfall: https://paste.debian.net/1204702/
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:06:00] acresearch: you messed up where the loop ends; the mean is obviously computed after the loop, not inside
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:06:09] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:08:26] mornfall: ok that gives me the final mean correctly
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:09:07] of course it does
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:09:53] mornfall: so then what about the final SD?   you said my code is wrong, which part?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[19:11:42] cherim_, i don't doubt you, but i don't follow what you're saying. in my paste, in the first section, p and x are always vectors (elements of the vector space, in this case an algebra), never coordinates. I abused the same letter T for the matrix (with respect to the basis {p,x,1} for a subspace) and the underlying linear transformation.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:14:24] acresearch: i already pointed that out
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:15:26] mornfall:  i fixed it, i still do not get the same number
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:16:14] then you probably didn't fix it right
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:16:55] mornfall: you can see my fix in the last code i sent you      final SD = 1.82  i got 1.59
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[19:16:55] What is your question about the exercise then? Are there any remaining?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[19:17:07] (your last paste still uses the wrong mean)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:17:26] mornfall: ah   of each list    ok   let me fix that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:18:14] mornfall: ok got a closer value    final SD = 1.82  i got 1.75
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[19:18:50] I understood that you don't like that 1) bottom 3x3 is the transpose of the top, 2) that Tp was not in the span <x, p> or some "2D space"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[19:19:33] cherim_, I'll work on it. probably as soon as I can formulate a question that makes sense, I'll be able to answer it. I appreciate your efforts
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[19:20:02] The first is answered (but it's not even very important since groups tructures are isomorphic), the second is inconsistent with the meaning of p, x
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[19:20:28] p'=ap+bx+c in the statement is already not in a "2D space"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[19:20:49] Since RHS is a combination of 3 linearly independent objects
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[19:21:59] Well, technically you can glue 1 and one of (p, x) by "fixing a representation as coordinate/momentum". But it's better left untouched
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[19:22:12] acresearch: one subtle detail is that stdev() divides by (n-1), where n is the sample size; so it's the usual unbiased estimator for the standard deviation.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[19:22:40] mm. i suppose i'm misinterpreting the other part of the question, where it asks for a group of symmetries of the complex 'plane' C^2.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[19:23:10] acresearch: But this whole computation is rather intricate. https://paste.debian.net/1204705/  seems to work
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:24:28] int-e: ok i have to go have dinner, i opened your paste, is it ok to look at it in 2 hour when i return?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	acresearch	[19:24:41] int-e: thank you for your input,    and mornfall thank you for your help too :-)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[19:25:21] you don't need my permission... I may not be around then, don't know yet
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[19:26:53] If I had to type this exercise, I'd first identify the automorphisms as a subgroup of SL(3, C) as you did, and only then note that the result is the same as complexification of area-preserving affine transformations
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cherim_	[19:27:47] (in 2dimensions)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[19:28:46] ah. that word 'represent'. (<https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS>). I only need a homomorphism. I don't need a physical intuition of what the 2D thing is.

2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[19:34:45] Daemonick: wtf
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Daemonick	[19:35:11] Archive - Londinium
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[19:35:24] fine
2021-07-18 16:36:23	greenbagels	[19:40:40] a mute for posting a music playlist?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[19:42:57] yes please
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:01:50] buster, i think you're overcomplicating it
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:02:11] you have affine area-preserving maps, that's all the exercise asks you to reealize
2021-07-18 16:36:23	kenthurley	[20:26:25] Are there finite groups of the same cardinality but "completely unisomorphic"?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:28:52] kenthurley: there are two distinct (nonisomorphic) groups of size 4.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:29:26] C_4 and K_4 = C_2^2, where C_n is the cyclic group of order n.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:30:01] (that "the" is justified by considering groups up to isomorphism; take it with a grain of salt)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:34:58] johnkeats6, i'm sure! but now i'm worried about the transpose stuff cherim_ explained. i don't think my linear algebra is *that* lacking. i think i just failed to communicate what i meant. but i'm worried.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:35:51] here's a very belaboured version of an answer, no doubt still full of typos, but emphasizing the transposition as a feature not a bug: https://ibb.co/9sj6zBK
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:36:03] may it be even less fun to read than it was to write :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:36:36] buster, well, if you have a basis e_1, ..., e_n you can think of the 'coordinates' x_1, ..., x_n as really the dual basis, so that's where the transposing is coming from
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:36:47] oh man. i know! :D
2021-07-18 16:36:23	kenthurley	[20:37:35] int-e: thank you for example, although I knew about it. For clarity, I'm on purpose asking about "completely unisomorphic". That is, something like for any bijection f between groups we would have f(xy)=f(x)f(y) for nothing except x=e or y=e. Well, that is not fully formal, but something like that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:37:48] (C^3)^* !! :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:38:10] hopefully you won't be offended if i don't read it :p
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:38:31] i'm cut to the quick
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:40:46] kenthurley: no such group exists
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:40:53]  kenthurley: well, in any two such groups you'll have non-trivial isomorphic subgroups
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:41:15] kenthurley: if you require it for *any* bijection between groups, you can always send e in H to any non-identity element g in G
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:43:16] kenthurley: If p is a prime factor of |G| then G has a subgroup ismorphic to C_p. It's a corollary of the Sylow theorems (is there a more elementary proof without them?)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:43:40] yes, it's called cauchy's theorem
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:43:50] there's a cute proof
2021-07-18 16:36:23	newpy	[20:44:44] how many ways are there to arrange 3 distinguishable balls in 3 buckets?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:44:45] Frobenius, 1884
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:44:49] loopspace: still wondering about your question?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:45:22] Sure
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:45:48] newpy: are they distinguishable buckets?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	newpy	[20:45:56] int-e, yes
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:46:13] so, for each ball, pick a bucket...
2021-07-18 16:36:23	newpy	[20:46:29] int-e, 4^3?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:46:36] 3^3 as you wrote it
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:46:58] it was something like: take the set of p-uples (g_1, ..., g_p) such that g_1 ... g_p = e, and let Z_p act on this by cyclically permuting this tuple.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	newpy	[20:47:10] int-e, whoops, so if we had 4 balls in 3 buckets?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:47:14] that's the one. Exercise 1.10, https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/14/mode/2up
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:47:20] newpy: then 3^4
2021-07-18 16:36:23	newpy	[20:47:21] 3^4?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:47:48] loopspace what's a^-1?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:48:10] a fixed point of this action is an element of order p
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:48:13] ah, they didn't do the bit where you extend it to non-abelian groups
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:48:17] Typo A^-1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:48:25] Presumably
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:48:56] loopspace: det A is -(w^2) right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:49:06] det b is 1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:49:23] so det inv(A) should be -1/(w^2)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:49:48] and, uh, let me remember
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:49:55] was it orbit stabilizer?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:50:13] Fangs: herp derp. Thx
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:50:23] loopspace: is w^2 = 1/w^2? if w is the (2^{n} - 1)-th root of unity?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:50:25] primitive root
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:50:33] err
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:50:41] 2^{n-1}
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:51:11] Fangs: I stupidly neglected det
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[20:51:41] johnkeats6: "Second proof", bottom of p.84 here: https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/84/mode/2up
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:51:51] loopspace: I genuinely don't remember enough maths to definitely say this means the highlighted relationship is wrong
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:54:36] w^2 = 1/w^2.. so w^4 = 1, nvm its probably wrong
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:54:51] buster, yeah. it's super cute
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:54:59] johnkeats6: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/be3jxDRh/image.png
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:55:20] loopspace: wikipedia uses [w 0; 0 conj(w)] and [0 -1; 1 0] instead
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:55:31] Yeah, that's the usual way
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:55:51] Rotman does it as above in two books for some reason
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:55:56] buster: Cauchy's theorem has a Wikipedia page, which also has that proof.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	int-e	[20:55:58] Thanks
2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[20:56:05] loopspace, indeed. what's your problem?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:56:41] johnkeats6: from earlier:
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:56:41] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:56:43] loopspace: I think you need to conjugate one of the ws to even have a chance
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:57:06] its probably bad OCR or genuine mistake in the text
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:58:19] It's in another book too, in a slightly different form. Also, the above matches my paper copy. Here's the other https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/voxMN1Is/image.png
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:58:33] am I missing something?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:58:44] Where https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NVu6VDpe/image.png
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[20:58:54] Well, Fangs that was my question
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[20:59:59] .. let me try this again.. det(A) = -(w^2) and det(B) = 1 if I haven't mixed up which diagonals are negative
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:00:25] det(BA inv(B)) = -(w^2)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:00:33] but det(inv(A)) = -1/(w^2)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:01:06] Let w=i. "Generalize"  <jk>
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:01:09] so w^2 = 1/w^2 needs to be true, but this is only true if w^4 = 1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:01:31] so w is 2-th root of unity or 4th root of unity?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:01:59] Yeah, this bugged me. On the other side of the balance was its separate appearance in two separate Rotman books
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:02:21] w is a 2^(n-1)-th root of unity
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:02:48] so for n > 3, it seemed problematic
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:02:48] loopspace: its only true for n < 3, not n >= 3.. I think?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	anovick_	[21:02:50] Anybody knows how to use WolframAlpha to find the limit value of a definite integral defined on a paramter? I tried this but it says time exceeded: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lim%28%28integrate+t%5E2+*arctan%28e%5Et%29+dt+from+0+to+sqrt%28x%29%29+%2F+x%5E%283%2F2%29%29+as+x-%3Einf
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:03:00] off by one, you're right
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:03:12] Fangs: it's hardly be generalized quaternions then
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:03:39] loopspace: I recall someone finding a mistake on rotman's homological algebra book too
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:03:51] idk which book you're reading
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:04:12] Yeah, I've found some mistakes there, and there's an errata sheet,  but this isn't in it. The other books it's in is his group theory book (didn't check others)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:04:24] I'm reading both
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:07:10] I don't remember any mistakes in his alg top book, but that's probably because I couldn't detect any
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:07:37] I couldn't detect any if there are any*
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:07:39] There were some. I didn't keep a list, just fixed them in my paper copy
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:08:19] were they all obvious?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[21:08:52] if the GL(2,C) example you showed is indeed wrong, I wouldn't call it as 'obvious'
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[21:09:09] For the most part, IIRC. Occasional one which was very confusing for topics that I didn't visit in the past, but easily sorted once I questioned them and looked at another sorce

2021-07-18 16:36:23	johnkeats6	[23:20:37] it's just a fancy schmancy diagonalization
2021-07-18 16:36:23	buster	[23:25:43] if you've sent something to negative imaginary infinity and then thought of it intuitively as infintesimal this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:08:44] hello! I've a list of trekking routes and for each one I have many x,y,z points (lat,lon,elevation) to draw them on map (they come from openstreetmap and are publicly available). I already have the total length, the elevation profile, the accumulated ascent and accumulated descent, but what I need to calculate is what is the best *partial* track for persons that have difficulties in handling climbs
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:08:46] and descents, so basically I'm looking for long partial tracks with low accumulated ascent and descent
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:10:27] long story short, I'm looking for portions of tracks where the elevation profile is more or less flat (something I can tune)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:11:55] arkanoid: brute force should work okay
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:15:06] (at least as long as you are okay with absolute thresholds on ascent/descent… relative to total length would be a bit more tricky)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:16:48] mornfall: problem is that the trekking routes I get from openstreetmap are very very long, like 100km or more. I'm not interested in them as a whole, but just on parts that can be enjoyed by the aforementioned persons with some difficulties
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:18:04] so for brute forcing them I'd have to calculate accumulated ascend and descend of all the possible segments (well, up to a maximum total distance)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:19:30] yes, but computers are fast and moving the segment is very simple
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:20:22] ok, but the points composing the tracks are not all the same distance-
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:20:27] well, btw, you're right
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:20:35] probably I just have to hardcode some rules
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:20:42] thanks!
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:20:47] if cur_len + next_len > thresh_len: subtract the ascend/descent of the first segment from the running total
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:21:02] add the ascent/descent of the next segment, shuffle some pointers
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:21:50] more or less the same story for the ascent/descent thresholds
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:22:21] it'd get interesting if you had a teleport
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:23:13] haha
2021-07-18 16:36:23	arkanoid	[00:24:07] I was going the hard way thinking about frequecy patterns and filters on the elevation profile and stuff like that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:31:29] arkanoid: i would perhaps suggest killing segments with the rate of ascent/descent above some threshold, which will both improve the quality of results and make the problem easier (by breaking up the tracks into smaller chunks)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	mornfall	[00:32:01] (bbl, gotta sleep some)

2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:32:05] if lim (x->y) || f(x) - f(y) ||  =   0 , how can I conclude lim x-> y  f(x) = f(y) ?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:33:49] the original problem is to prove that a function that satisfies ||f(x) - f(y) ||  <=  K||x-y ||^alpha   for positive alpha and K and for f: A subset R^n -> R^m is continous in the domain A
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:37:10] what do you have to work with?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:37:32] sometimes you are given that if ||a_n|| goes to zero then a_n goes to zero
2021-07-18 16:36:23	dude12312414	[01:37:58] well this should be an easy consequence of the epsilon-delta definition though
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:38:02] hi powerful frelleck
2021-07-18 16:36:23	 *	frelleck [01:38:10] fires a lightning bolt
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:38:30] the problem is just a multivariable lipschitz boi but he wants us to prove that that implies continuity
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:38:37] https://imgur.com/a/CSMN2bp
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:38:38] the boi
2021-07-18 16:36:23	dude12312414	[01:38:44] like, unrolling the definition for |a_n| -> 0 will turn up the same as the one for a_n -> 0
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:39:18] nothing is coming up for that image
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:40:25] https://imgur.com/a/rsXYmgU
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:40:27] that one works
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:41:10] https://imgur.com/a/4452uPo       this is the kind of proof he wants, (the part it says "prop")
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:41:15] it's something of the form: as y -- > x,  you have y - x --> 0, so ||y - x|| --> 0, so ||y - x||^(alpha) --> 0, so ||f(y) - f(x)|| ---> 0, so f(y) ---> f(x).
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:41:21] but how you do that depends what you're given
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:41:39] you could just do deltas and epsilons like dude12312414 suggested
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:41:39] i found this "reverse" triangle inequality
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:41:46] i think i could use that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:41:59] that gives that ||x|| is continuous
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:42:01] those always destroy me hehe
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:42:12] I have developed allergies to e-d limits
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:42:46] if you start with ||y - x|| < delta you should end out with ||f(y) - f(x)|| < K delta^(alpha)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:42:58] see if you can prove that and then turn it into a delta epsilon
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:43:55] will do
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:44:05] gonna see if i can convince you with reverse triangle f
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:45:23] https://imgur.com/a/w71SMBp
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:45:30] does this  make sense to you?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:49:14] you don't really need the last part
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:49:30] with the reverse triangle inequality
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:49:40] and before that you are assuming the limit exists, but you don't know that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:50:15] but if K and alpha are positive and
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:50:31] K||x-y||^alpha goes to 0
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:50:42] so by squeeze theorem the middle should too right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:51:04] or not necesarilly?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:51:05] you should add that statement
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:51:13] just saying it needs to be justified
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:51:58] so first say 0 <= ||f(x) - f(y)|| <= K||x - y||^(alpha)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:52:04] then use the squeeze theorem to justify
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:52:24] (if you're allowed that)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:54:03] right right
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:54:20] so then with that I conclude lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:54:26] yeah
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:54:29] but i still need to prove continuity
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:55:00] so i need to take the argument of that norm apart to form the lim x->y   f(x) = f(y)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:55:05] that's the definition of continuity
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:55:08] (almost)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:55:27] you should have a statement that lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0 is equivalent to f(x) --> f(y)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:55:52] thats where I thought the triangle boi could be used
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:56:11] to me it seems to do it but im a noob so i go to the powerful frelleck
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:56:18] nah the norms converging isn't enough
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:56:51] you could have (1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (1,-1),...
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:57:43] hmph
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:58:07] it's just that lim ||a_n|| = 0 implies lim a_n = 0 basically
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[01:58:23] ahh
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:58:26] applied to ||f(x_n) - f(y)|| for any x_n converging to y
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[01:58:31] you have to have it in some form somehow
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[02:00:43] how do you remember all this
2021-07-18 16:36:23	frelleck	[02:01:11] I have a vast mind
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Nickssen	[02:01:43]  lightning bolt capability

2021-07-18 16:36:23	paulo_	[02:54:57] hi, is there a book you can suggest for elliptic curves?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	paulo_	[02:55:06] I have college level math (calculus)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[03:05:34] Maybe Silverman/Tate

2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[03:07:59] loopspace: going from calculus to silverman seems.. cruel

2021-07-18 16:36:23	loopspace	[03:09:14] Utm version not that bad was it?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[03:12:03] loopspace: do they explain what rings are?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	noobly`	[04:38:38] given a real reimann integrable and bounded function in [a,b], I'm asked to show that a function g(x), defined as the integral of f(x) from x to b (for x in [a,b]), is continuous. this is obvious to me since the integral doesn't care much if it's integrand isn't continuous; it will continuously return real values regardless. my trouble is in converting this to a proper arguement.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	greenbagels	[05:01:18] noobly`: remember the formal definition of continuity
2021-07-18 16:36:23	noobly`	[05:04:51] greenbagels: is the squeeze theorem not relevant? someone else told me that was where to look. I'm inclined to think you're right, but I think I'm missing an easier path given that it was stated f(x) is bounded
2021-07-18 16:36:23	rsonx	[06:23:11] this text https://i.imgur.com/cKGxteh.png says that there are two conditions for DPDA. What about PDA being in state q, reading 'a' on input and reading no symbol from the stack. will that also not result in non-determinism.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	jmnbtslsQE	[06:45:21] noobly`: without loss of generality can you get within epsilon of the integral at x from one side ?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	jmnbtslsQE	[06:47:02] where x is some fixed point that you want to show continuity at
2021-07-18 16:36:23	jmnbtslsQE	[06:47:52] maybe better to call it x_0
2021-07-18 16:36:23	jmnbtslsQE	[06:48:56] if x_1<x_0, |g(x_1) - g(x_0)| is the integral from x_1 to x_0 of f, and f is bounded
2021-07-18 16:36:23	PlanckWalk	[07:06:56] rsonx: Those symbols are not amazingly meaningful without context of how they're being used. I can probably guess, but it would be nice not to have to guess.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	tusko	[07:07:24] say we have a DE given by M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0 that is exact. Does the solution we find \Phi(x,y) = ... = C give the level curves for any choice of C that is defined?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	tusko	[07:07:49] Or is this what the explicit solution y(t) gives or what?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	PlanckWalk	[07:09:13] phi(x,y) = C does give level curves for phi, which corresponds to possible trajectories for (x,y)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	PlanckWalk	[07:10:27] Particular solutions may only trace out subsets of those level curves, though.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	tusko	[07:12:47] Ok, that's what I was thinking. Once we solve for the particular solution, by plugging y and x values into phi(x,y) we effectively collapse ourselves down to one trajectory on that surface?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	PlanckWalk	[07:13:17] Yes, the initial values will (usually) yield a particular solution.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cadmio	[09:25:24] Hello
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cadmio	[09:27:00] if the canonical projection pi:G -> G/N, with N normal subgroup of G is restricted to a subngroup H. What's the Kernel of the mapping?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:31:33] so you have H <= G, and want to know ker pi|_H
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:32:07] i imagine we should split this into two, maybe 3 cases. N <= H, H <= N and neither maybe
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:32:21] at least to start working on the problem
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cadmio	[09:32:57] let H an arbitrary subgroup of G
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:33:10] I think since H <= G,  H cap N <| H  or something like this
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lisp123	[09:35:13] My brain is wracking me, is a < b same as b > a?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:35:22] yes they are the same
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lisp123	[09:35:32] riv: thanks :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cadmio	[09:36:03] the identity element in G/N is N, right?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:36:11] yes
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cadmio	[09:37:38] so pi|_H : h -> hN
2021-07-18 16:36:23	cadmio	[09:39:35] ok so in order to ger hN = N you need an 'h', which is in N
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:39:53] so kernel pi = { g in G | gN = N } = N
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:40:20] and kernel pi|_H = { h in H | hN = N } = ?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	riv	[09:40:39] yes, something in H and in N
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Fangs	[10:15:59] cadmio: note that if you have two sets A and B, the set A n B = { x | x in A and x in B}

2021-07-18 16:56:23	rendar	i put into wolfram alpha something to solve, and it replied with a strange operator i don't know: # -- what's that? and, what about Root[] ? it means to find the roots of the function? e.g. when x==0?

2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:40:34] But r can get really close to R as the hole gets smaller.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:41:38] As an aside, there are these rock torusses in Southern Africa. I always assumed that academics knew what they were used for, but apparently, no-one has figured out what they were used for.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:42:12] In contrast, there are rocks with depressions in that don't go through the rock, that everyone agrees were used to mill grain.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[17:42:38] i recall reading that archeologists generally don't have any idea what things were used for and most of it are just guesses
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:42:49] But the thing is, to make a rock torus, you need a lot of effort plus it seems that the torus will always be smaller than the rock you make it out of.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[17:43:19] they probably built it as a visual aid for homology computations
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:43:27] johnkeats6: This situation is a bit different, because there was prehistoric cultural appropriation, it seems.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:43:54] So we know about use cases, but we don't know about original reasons for going through all the effort.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[17:44:29] heh 'prehistoric cultural appropriation'
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:44:33] The arrows-without-sticks are also rather well understood. One interesting thing about them is they were made from round rocks, and not from already-arrow-looking-rocks as I had assumed.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:44:58] johnkeats6: It seems like the torusses were left around for future generations to figure out what to use them for.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:45:12] Which is cultural appropriation, isn't it?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:46:12] And in terms of effort... it's like pyramid building levels of effort to made those torusses. Well, that's how I see it at least. It was prehistoric proof of work.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:46:43] But while the pyramids were also proof of slavery, these are well, only proof of work.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[17:46:58] ~aliens~
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:47:16] I think it's simpler to assume that people would spend 5 years making a torus.

2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:48:01] If you take out the staying alive factor.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Inline	[17:48:04] hahahah true that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:48:21] I think the holes are just so you can put a rope through it.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:49:33] It's like algebraically studying topology, right. The holes are just there so that there is some group that can identify the hole by either putting something in the hole, or drawing a path around it.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:50:32] So, actually I agree that they were practical aids for reminding people of holes in rocks. Otherwise, how would you know that you can make a hole in a rock? I would contest it without seeing it.

2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:52:25] Inline: Isn't that what happens when you can't fix at least one truth?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:57:59] But there is some consensus actually in the scientific community, unlike what has happened with Mochizuki, which is that the rocks were made longer ago than initially though. Which may not mean much, but it means at least that current cultures (including the San / Khoi) didn't make them.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[17:58:10] *thought
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Inline	[18:03:38] why unify ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Inline	[18:03:48] i'd be pretty content with mosaics
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Inline	[18:05:22] as long as they purport to describe stuff correctly, instead of this unification craziness as if though unification would entail a property of explanatory power to physics (it does not) physics stays the way it is (i.e. descriptive)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[18:06:47] Inline: Are you talking about stone rocks? The rope comment was because it makes it easy to carry and makes the stone more useful. The other comments were mostly jokes.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:07:19] i think Inline is talking to someone invisible
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Inline	[18:07:44] if the solution is in creating fiction with half working math (or none at all on close inspection) and danger of more confusion i'd rather stick to the mosaic
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Inline	[18:08:07] erm, sorry
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:08:09] it seems my ignore list is empty, so i don't quite understand what is going on
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Inline	[18:10:14] taeaad: that was not to you with your rock stuff
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[18:10:41] Oh, OK.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:11:25] people, i asked a question earlier but then had to leave... if i have 3 lists [X1, X2, X3] and I want the final SD for all values in all the lists... I can either combine all the values into one list and get that SD, or calculate the SD of each list then take their mean... i do not get the same answer, why?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[18:11:29] Have any of you read Peter Scholze's ideas on "condensed sets"?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:12:54] acresearch: why would you expect to get the same answer?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:13:14] acresearch: take the limit where each of the sub-lists only has 1 item
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:13:35] acresearch: then your mean-of-deviations will be 0 for arbitrary inputs
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:14:59] acresearch: or if you want to go about it differently, just plug in the expressions for the 3 sub-deviations into the formula for the mean and notice how it's a different formula from the formula for the devation of the entire list
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:15:56] mornfall: i am sorry, i did not understand the two options
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:16:36] why do i need to take the limit?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:16:43] and which expression are you talking about?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	joel135	[18:17:07] taeaad: what are they good for?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:17:43] acresearch: not limit in the analysis sense
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:19:28] just consider σ([x₁, x₂, …, xₙ]) vs avg([σ([x₁]), σ([x₂]), …, σ([xₙ])])
2021-07-18 20:21:09	joel135	[18:19:40] Ok I guess it is this: "Question 1.1. How to do algebra when rings/modules/groups carry a topology?"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:19:49] mornfall: i see
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[18:19:49] int-e, it took me a bit to figure out why the Jonsson Lemma 2.4 is correct about any given circle s_alpha intersection only finitely many of the admissible circles that go through a given (x,y,z), but I finally did. They really could have used a picture for that part.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[18:20:02] intersecting*
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:20:23] mornfall: so is there no way to calculate the final SD without combining all values of the three lists?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[18:20:51] johnkeats6: cherim_: http://mathb.in/60917 does this explain my difficulty? in my experience, using a 3d space for affine (or projective) stuffs goes like the second part. but what we have is not that.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:20:55] mornfall: i.e get SD seperatly? then combine SD? to get the final SD?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:20:56] acresearch: unless your data has some special form, then no
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[18:21:09] Z-module: you can basically only rotate around the (x,y,z') axis where z' varies, ignoring the xy plane
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:21:50] mornfall: the reason for my question is because i have very large data points    30k lists each with 7M points     i need to find the final SD but i cannot combine the lists into RAM memory
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[18:22:03] Z-module: because z determines where on the circle you are.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:22:15] mornfall: but i can find the SD of individual lists
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[18:22:26] if we can call the missing y's in the second part a "typo"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[18:22:29] all the circles involved having their top point in one horizontal plane and their bottom point in another is what makes that happen.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[18:22:36] Z-module: that was my intuition, I didn't even read the proof after understanding the restriction of the circles.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[18:22:53] acresearch, you can certainly compute sd iteratively without having to hold all values in memory
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:23:01] johnkeats6: hoe?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:23:04] johnkeats6: how?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[18:23:14] Z-module: Yes, that additional restriction is really clever. It's what ensures the non-linking property too.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[18:23:17] just sum (value - mean)^2 over each value?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:23:20] acresearch: just accumulate the squared errors
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[18:24:00] Z-module: (in addition to restricting to vertical planes)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[18:24:10] anyway, it's neat how merely a well-ordering of R (or of R^3 or of all the circles in R^3, same thing) is what enables all of this, without having to use c = aleph_1. There are other types of magic constructions where you do need CH.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:24:18] johnkeats6: mornfall which one is it?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:24:54] acresearch: let me try a different way… you have surely heard of mapreduce?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:25:07] mornfall: no
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:25:15] damn
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:25:27] mornfall: sorry
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[18:25:45] Like my very favorite equivalent of CH:   CH  iff  There exists a single function f:R -> R so that the plane is the union of countably many sets, where each set is either some translate of the graph of f, or a translate of that graph rotated by pi/2 radians.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:26:15] acresearch: compute the sum of squared errors (don't take the square root) of each sub-list, sum up those, then take the root
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:26:57] acresearch: (don't divide by the number of elements either… think about how you would compute the mean of all the values instead, without loading them all into ram)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:26:58] mornfall: ok 1 moment let me code it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[18:32:34] johnkeats6, cherim_, with two of the typos fixed, http://mathb.in/60918 . in the first section, the images T(p), T(x) *aren't even in* my 2D space :/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:34:51] What you struggle with has no specifics of non-commutativity or operators or physics
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:35:26] Actions of a linear transformation on vectors and on coordinates of vectors are different
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:35:49] Given by mutual transposes in terms of matrix elements
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:36:54] If you rewrite the last example (2D affine) in terms of what Te_x, Te_y are for coordinate orts e_x, e_y, you'll get the top matrix
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:38:55] mornfall: ok i tried your method, but i get a totally different number
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:39:20] Or yo can say that your (Weyl) algebra is parametrized by X*x+Y*p+Z*1 and describe transformations in terms of (X', Y', Z')=T(X, Y, Z)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:39:33] That will transpose the top form into bottom form
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:42:26] acresearch: you did the 1/N and the square root at the end, right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:43:30] mornfall: N= total number of points in all lists right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:43:36] sure
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:44:17] mornfall: ok i coded it,   but still very different number
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:44:23] first you sum everything in all lists and divide by N to get μ
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:44:34] mornfall: yes
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:45:23] then you compute the sum of (xᵢ - μ)² for each list, add those sums together, divide by N, take a square root
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[18:45:30] thanks cherim_. (coordinate orts? is that a typo? coordinates wrt?)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:45:36] make sure you don't overflow something
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:45:59] those are going to be some big numbers
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:47:20] mornfall: yes,   want to see my code?   it is crappy but follow these steps
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:47:39] Suppose you have a linear map T:R^3 ->R^3. You can define it by Te_1 = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3,  Te_2 = a' e_1 + b' e_2 + c' e_3, Te_3 = a'' e_1 + b'' e_2 + c'' e_3
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:47:46] then you are probably overflowing… consider import fractions if this is python
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[18:48:15] yep.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:48:16] Then T gets a "matrix" with coordinates a, b, c, a', ...
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:49:07] mornfall: what do you mean?    here is my code: https://paste.debian.net/1204700/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:49:15] You can also define the same transformation by saying that a vector with coordinates (x1, x2, x3) is mapped to (Ax1+Bx2+Cx3, A'x1+B'x2+C'x3, A''x1+B''x2+C''x3)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:49:36] Where the coordinates are as in v=x1 e1+x2 e2+x3 e3
2021-07-18 20:21:09	taeaad	[18:49:54] joel135: I think they are an alternative of sorts to a topological space.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:50:00] Then you get another matrix with entries A, B, C, A', ...
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:50:03] acresearch: uhh, what?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:50:12] How is it related to the one with entries a, b, c, a'...?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:50:20] acresearch: mean = statistics.stdev(…)?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:50:28] mornfall: is it not?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:50:32] oh wait
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:50:37] dam   i mixed them up
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:50:43] acresearch: also you are not even close to doing what i told you to do
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:51:09] mornfall: i calcualted the standard error right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:51:26] acresearch: you are calculating a bunch of nonsense, tbh…
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:51:32] mornfall: hmmmm
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:51:57] mornfall: ok let me go back and see how to calculate the standard error, i might have seen the wrong article
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:52:18] acresearch: just do what i told you to do, there isn't anything else to it, really
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[18:52:19] (a b c)^T = (A A' A'')^T, and so on. they are mutually transpose.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:52:28] In you mathbin paste the same happens. p, x, 1 are basis vectors of a Weyl algebra. Not coordinates. As I said, they can't be numbers already by noncommutativity
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:52:50] Like e1, e2, e3
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:53:19] So no wonder you get transposes
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:53:30] mornfall: calculate sum of error for each list, add all sum of errors, divide by N, sqrt  right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:53:58] acresearch: yes, notice the part where you need the mean of the entire dataset for that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:54:10] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:54:10] can't just take the mean of the sublist
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:54:24] mornfall: wait,   i am confused now
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:54:54] mornfall: no when calculating the standard error  i value-mean   where mean is of the while dataset?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:55:57] acresearch: for l in [X1, X2, X3]: { means.append(sum(l)); lens.append(len(l)) } ; mean = sum(sums)/sum(lens) ;
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[18:56:06] To be honest, if you are reading a physics book on "operators and canonical quantization" and try to interpret momentum and coordinate as numbers (simultaneously) in the exercises section, the book is not that good
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:56:21] acresearch: as i have explicitly said before… sum _all_ the data points and divide by the size of the entire data set
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[18:56:50] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:57:10] acresearch: you are probably going to run into precision problems with floats
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[18:57:44] acresearch: you might want to ask someone more qualified to do this for you :\
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[18:58:39] mornfall: probably,  either way i am not getting the excpeted final SD,,, so i guess the closest approach is to just calculate the SD of each sub list and take a mean of all the SDs
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:00:56] acresearch: you are going to get random garbage
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:01:30] mornfall: there is no alternative, i think your approach works, but... i still need the mean of the whole database, which i cannot get because i cannot import it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:01:49] *sigh*
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:01:59] mornfall: dealing with data larger than what a supercomputer can handel is frustrating :-(
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:02:13] i literally wrote that part of the program for you
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:02:21] mornfall: which did not work
2021-07-18 20:21:09	fweht	[19:02:33] im a bit confused why these maps F^f_t act on C^\infty(\mathbf{R}^{2n}) as opposed to directly on \mathbf{R}^{2n}? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CYruQnst/image.png
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:02:38] did you try it?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:02:48] to get the _mean_
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:02:50] mornfall: yes   one moment i will paste my code
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:04:46] mornfall: https://paste.debian.net/1204702/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:06:00] acresearch: you messed up where the loop ends; the mean is obviously computed after the loop, not inside
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:06:09] mornfall: oh
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:08:26] mornfall: ok that gives me the final mean correctly
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:09:07] of course it does
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:09:53] mornfall: so then what about the final SD?   you said my code is wrong, which part?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[19:11:42] cherim_, i don't doubt you, but i don't follow what you're saying. in my paste, in the first section, p and x are always vectors (elements of the vector space, in this case an algebra), never coordinates. I abused the same letter T for the matrix (with respect to the basis {p,x,1} for a subspace) and the underlying linear transformation.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:14:24] acresearch: i already pointed that out
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:15:26] mornfall:  i fixed it, i still do not get the same number
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:16:14] then you probably didn't fix it right
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:16:55] mornfall: you can see my fix in the last code i sent you      final SD = 1.82  i got 1.59
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[19:16:55] What is your question about the exercise then? Are there any remaining?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[19:17:07] (your last paste still uses the wrong mean)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:17:26] mornfall: ah   of each list    ok   let me fix that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:18:14] mornfall: ok got a closer value    final SD = 1.82  i got 1.75
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[19:18:50] I understood that you don't like that 1) bottom 3x3 is the transpose of the top, 2) that Tp was not in the span <x, p> or some "2D space"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[19:19:33] cherim_, I'll work on it. probably as soon as I can formulate a question that makes sense, I'll be able to answer it. I appreciate your efforts
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[19:20:02] The first is answered (but it's not even very important since groups tructures are isomorphic), the second is inconsistent with the meaning of p, x
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[19:20:28] p'=ap+bx+c in the statement is already not in a "2D space"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[19:20:49] Since RHS is a combination of 3 linearly independent objects
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[19:21:59] Well, technically you can glue 1 and one of (p, x) by "fixing a representation as coordinate/momentum". But it's better left untouched
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[19:22:12] acresearch: one subtle detail is that stdev() divides by (n-1), where n is the sample size; so it's the usual unbiased estimator for the standard deviation.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[19:22:40] mm. i suppose i'm misinterpreting the other part of the question, where it asks for a group of symmetries of the complex 'plane' C^2.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[19:23:10] acresearch: But this whole computation is rather intricate. https://paste.debian.net/1204705/  seems to work
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:24:28] int-e: ok i have to go have dinner, i opened your paste, is it ok to look at it in 2 hour when i return?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	acresearch	[19:24:41] int-e: thank you for your input,    and mornfall thank you for your help too :-)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[19:25:21] you don't need my permission... I may not be around then, don't know yet
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[19:26:53] If I had to type this exercise, I'd first identify the automorphisms as a subgroup of SL(3, C) as you did, and only then note that the result is the same as complexification of area-preserving affine transformations
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[19:27:47] (in 2dimensions)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[19:28:46] ah. that word 'represent'. (<https://ibb.co/FVLWkkS>). I only need a homomorphism. I don't need a physical intuition of what the 2D thing is.

2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[19:34:45] Daemonick: wtf
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Daemonick	[19:35:11] Archive - Londinium
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[19:35:24] fine
2021-07-18 20:21:09	greenbagels	[19:40:40] a mute for posting a music playlist?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[19:42:57] yes please
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:01:50] buster, i think you're overcomplicating it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:02:11] you have affine area-preserving maps, that's all the exercise asks you to reealize
2021-07-18 20:21:09	kenthurley	[20:26:25] Are there finite groups of the same cardinality but "completely unisomorphic"?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:28:52] kenthurley: there are two distinct (nonisomorphic) groups of size 4.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:29:26] C_4 and K_4 = C_2^2, where C_n is the cyclic group of order n.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:30:01] (that "the" is justified by considering groups up to isomorphism; take it with a grain of salt)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:34:58] johnkeats6, i'm sure! but now i'm worried about the transpose stuff cherim_ explained. i don't think my linear algebra is *that* lacking. i think i just failed to communicate what i meant. but i'm worried.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:35:51] here's a very belaboured version of an answer, no doubt still full of typos, but emphasizing the transposition as a feature not a bug: https://ibb.co/9sj6zBK
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:36:03] may it be even less fun to read than it was to write :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:36:36] buster, well, if you have a basis e_1, ..., e_n you can think of the 'coordinates' x_1, ..., x_n as really the dual basis, so that's where the transposing is coming from
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:36:47] oh man. i know! :D
2021-07-18 20:21:09	kenthurley	[20:37:35] int-e: thank you for example, although I knew about it. For clarity, I'm on purpose asking about "completely unisomorphic". That is, something like for any bijection f between groups we would have f(xy)=f(x)f(y) for nothing except x=e or y=e. Well, that is not fully formal, but something like that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:37:48] (C^3)^* !! :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:38:10] hopefully you won't be offended if i don't read it :p
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:38:31] i'm cut to the quick
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:40:46] kenthurley: no such group exists
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:40:53]  kenthurley: well, in any two such groups you'll have non-trivial isomorphic subgroups
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:41:15] kenthurley: if you require it for *any* bijection between groups, you can always send e in H to any non-identity element g in G
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:43:16] kenthurley: If p is a prime factor of |G| then G has a subgroup ismorphic to C_p. It's a corollary of the Sylow theorems (is there a more elementary proof without them?)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:43:40] yes, it's called cauchy's theorem
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:43:50] there's a cute proof
2021-07-18 20:21:09	newpy	[20:44:44] how many ways are there to arrange 3 distinguishable balls in 3 buckets?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:44:45] Frobenius, 1884
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:44:49] loopspace: still wondering about your question?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:45:22] Sure
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:45:48] newpy: are they distinguishable buckets?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	newpy	[20:45:56] int-e, yes
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:46:13] so, for each ball, pick a bucket...
2021-07-18 20:21:09	newpy	[20:46:29] int-e, 4^3?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:46:36] 3^3 as you wrote it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:46:58] it was something like: take the set of p-uples (g_1, ..., g_p) such that g_1 ... g_p = e, and let Z_p act on this by cyclically permuting this tuple.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	newpy	[20:47:10] int-e, whoops, so if we had 4 balls in 3 buckets?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:47:14] that's the one. Exercise 1.10, https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/14/mode/2up
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:47:20] newpy: then 3^4
2021-07-18 20:21:09	newpy	[20:47:21] 3^4?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:47:48] loopspace what's a^-1?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:48:10] a fixed point of this action is an element of order p
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:48:13] ah, they didn't do the bit where you extend it to non-abelian groups
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:48:17] Typo A^-1
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:48:25] Presumably
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:48:56] loopspace: det A is -(w^2) right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:49:06] det b is 1
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:49:23] so det inv(A) should be -1/(w^2)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:49:48] and, uh, let me remember
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:49:55] was it orbit stabilizer?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:50:13] Fangs: herp derp. Thx
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:50:23] loopspace: is w^2 = 1/w^2? if w is the (2^{n} - 1)-th root of unity?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:50:25] primitive root
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:50:33] err
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:50:41] 2^{n-1}
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:51:11] Fangs: I stupidly neglected det
2021-07-18 20:21:09	buster	[20:51:41] johnkeats6: "Second proof", bottom of p.84 here: https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/84/mode/2up
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:51:51] loopspace: I genuinely don't remember enough maths to definitely say this means the highlighted relationship is wrong
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:54:36] w^2 = 1/w^2.. so w^4 = 1, nvm its probably wrong
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:54:51] buster, yeah. it's super cute
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:54:59] johnkeats6: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/be3jxDRh/image.png
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:55:20] loopspace: wikipedia uses [w 0; 0 conj(w)] and [0 -1; 1 0] instead
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:55:31] Yeah, that's the usual way
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:55:51] Rotman does it as above in two books for some reason
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:55:56] buster: Cauchy's theorem has a Wikipedia page, which also has that proof.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	int-e	[20:55:58] Thanks
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[20:56:05] loopspace, indeed. what's your problem?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:56:41] johnkeats6: from earlier:
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:56:41] What am I missing here? The highlighted (typoed) relation doesn't seem to be true https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2HsxSo5c/image.png
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:56:43] loopspace: I think you need to conjugate one of the ws to even have a chance
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:57:06] its probably bad OCR or genuine mistake in the text
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:58:19] It's in another book too, in a slightly different form. Also, the above matches my paper copy. Here's the other https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/voxMN1Is/image.png
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:58:33] am I missing something?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:58:44] Where https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NVu6VDpe/image.png
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[20:58:54] Well, Fangs that was my question
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[20:59:59] .. let me try this again.. det(A) = -(w^2) and det(B) = 1 if I haven't mixed up which diagonals are negative
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:00:25] det(BA inv(B)) = -(w^2)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:00:33] but det(inv(A)) = -1/(w^2)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:01:06] Let w=i. "Generalize"  <jk>
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:01:09] so w^2 = 1/w^2 needs to be true, but this is only true if w^4 = 1
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:01:31] so w is 2-th root of unity or 4th root of unity?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:01:59] Yeah, this bugged me. On the other side of the balance was its separate appearance in two separate Rotman books
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:02:21] w is a 2^(n-1)-th root of unity
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:02:48] so for n > 3, it seemed problematic
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:02:48] loopspace: its only true for n < 3, not n >= 3.. I think?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	anovick_	[21:02:50] Anybody knows how to use WolframAlpha to find the limit value of a definite integral defined on a paramter? I tried this but it says time exceeded: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lim%28%28integrate+t%5E2+*arctan%28e%5Et%29+dt+from+0+to+sqrt%28x%29%29+%2F+x%5E%283%2F2%29%29+as+x-%3Einf
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:03:00] off by one, you're right
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:03:12] Fangs: it's hardly be generalized quaternions then
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:03:39] loopspace: I recall someone finding a mistake on rotman's homological algebra book too
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:03:51] idk which book you're reading
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:04:12] Yeah, I've found some mistakes there, and there's an errata sheet,  but this isn't in it. The other books it's in is his group theory book (didn't check others)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:04:24] I'm reading both
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:07:10] I don't remember any mistakes in his alg top book, but that's probably because I couldn't detect any
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:07:37] I couldn't detect any if there are any*
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:07:39] There were some. I didn't keep a list, just fixed them in my paper copy
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:08:19] were they all obvious?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[21:08:52] if the GL(2,C) example you showed is indeed wrong, I wouldn't call it as 'obvious'
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[21:09:09] For the most part, IIRC. Occasional one which was very confusing for topics that I didn't visit in the past, but easily sorted once I questioned them and looked at another sorce

2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:08:44] hello! I've a list of trekking routes and for each one I have many x,y,z points (lat,lon,elevation) to draw them on map (they come from openstreetmap and are publicly available). I already have the total length, the elevation profile, the accumulated ascent and accumulated descent, but what I need to calculate is what is the best *partial* track for persons that have difficulties in handling climbs
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:08:46] and descents, so basically I'm looking for long partial tracks with low accumulated ascent and descent
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:10:27] long story short, I'm looking for portions of tracks where the elevation profile is more or less flat (something I can tune)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:11:55] arkanoid: brute force should work okay
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:15:06] (at least as long as you are okay with absolute thresholds on ascent/descent… relative to total length would be a bit more tricky)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:16:48] mornfall: problem is that the trekking routes I get from openstreetmap are very very long, like 100km or more. I'm not interested in them as a whole, but just on parts that can be enjoyed by the aforementioned persons with some difficulties
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:18:04] so for brute forcing them I'd have to calculate accumulated ascend and descend of all the possible segments (well, up to a maximum total distance)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:19:30] yes, but computers are fast and moving the segment is very simple
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:20:22] ok, but the points composing the tracks are not all the same distance-
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:20:27] well, btw, you're right
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:20:35] probably I just have to hardcode some rules
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:20:42] thanks!
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:20:47] if cur_len + next_len > thresh_len: subtract the ascend/descent of the first segment from the running total
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:21:02] add the ascent/descent of the next segment, shuffle some pointers
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:21:50] more or less the same story for the ascent/descent thresholds
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:22:21] it'd get interesting if you had a teleport
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:23:13] haha
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:24:07] I was going the hard way thinking about frequecy patterns and filters on the elevation profile and stuff like that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:31:29] arkanoid: i would perhaps suggest killing segments with the rate of ascent/descent above some threshold, which will both improve the quality of results and make the problem easier (by breaking up the tracks into smaller chunks)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mornfall	[00:32:01] (bbl, gotta sleep some)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arkanoid	[00:32:15] mornfall: thanks! goodnight
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:32:05] if lim (x->y) || f(x) - f(y) ||  =   0 , how can I conclude lim x-> y  f(x) = f(y) ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:33:49] the original problem is to prove that a function that satisfies ||f(x) - f(y) ||  <=  K||x-y ||^alpha   for positive alpha and K and for f: A subset R^n -> R^m is continous in the domain A
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:37:10] what do you have to work with?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:37:32] sometimes you are given that if ||a_n|| goes to zero then a_n goes to zero
2021-07-18 20:21:09	dude12312414	[01:37:58] well this should be an easy consequence of the epsilon-delta definition though
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:38:02] hi powerful frelleck
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	frelleck [01:38:10] fires a lightning bolt
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:38:30] the problem is just a multivariable lipschitz boi but he wants us to prove that that implies continuity
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:38:37] https://imgur.com/a/CSMN2bp
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:38:38] the boi
2021-07-18 20:21:09	dude12312414	[01:38:44] like, unrolling the definition for |a_n| -> 0 will turn up the same as the one for a_n -> 0
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:39:18] nothing is coming up for that image
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:40:25] https://imgur.com/a/rsXYmgU
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:40:27] that one works
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:41:10] https://imgur.com/a/4452uPo       this is the kind of proof he wants, (the part it says "prop")
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:41:15] it's something of the form: as y -- > x,  you have y - x --> 0, so ||y - x|| --> 0, so ||y - x||^(alpha) --> 0, so ||f(y) - f(x)|| ---> 0, so f(y) ---> f(x).
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:41:21] but how you do that depends what you're given
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:41:39] you could just do deltas and epsilons like dude12312414 suggested
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:41:39] i found this "reverse" triangle inequality
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:41:46] i think i could use that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:41:59] that gives that ||x|| is continuous
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:42:01] those always destroy me hehe
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:42:12] I have developed allergies to e-d limits
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:42:46] if you start with ||y - x|| < delta you should end out with ||f(y) - f(x)|| < K delta^(alpha)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:42:58] see if you can prove that and then turn it into a delta epsilon
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:43:55] will do
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:44:05] gonna see if i can convince you with reverse triangle f
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:45:23] https://imgur.com/a/w71SMBp
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:45:30] does this  make sense to you?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:49:14] you don't really need the last part
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:49:30] with the reverse triangle inequality
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:49:40] and before that you are assuming the limit exists, but you don't know that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:50:15] but if K and alpha are positive and
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:50:31] K||x-y||^alpha goes to 0
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:50:42] so by squeeze theorem the middle should too right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:51:04] or not necesarilly?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:51:05] you should add that statement
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:51:13] just saying it needs to be justified
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:51:58] so first say 0 <= ||f(x) - f(y)|| <= K||x - y||^(alpha)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:52:04] then use the squeeze theorem to justify
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:52:24] (if you're allowed that)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:54:03] right right
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:54:20] so then with that I conclude lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:54:26] yeah
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:54:29] but i still need to prove continuity
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:55:00] so i need to take the argument of that norm apart to form the lim x->y   f(x) = f(y)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:55:05] that's the definition of continuity
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:55:08] (almost)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:55:27] you should have a statement that lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0 is equivalent to f(x) --> f(y)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:55:52] thats where I thought the triangle boi could be used
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:56:11] to me it seems to do it but im a noob so i go to the powerful frelleck
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:56:18] nah the norms converging isn't enough
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:56:51] you could have (1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (1,-1),...
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:57:43] hmph
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:58:07] it's just that lim ||a_n|| = 0 implies lim a_n = 0 basically
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[01:58:23] ahh
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:58:26] applied to ||f(x_n) - f(y)|| for any x_n converging to y
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[01:58:31] you have to have it in some form somehow
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[02:00:43] how do you remember all this
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[02:01:11] I have a vast mind
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[02:01:43]  lightning bolt capability
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[02:02:01] I'm an AI sitting in a basement in Virginia
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[02:02:04] but enough about me
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[02:02:22] sciencephile the AI?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Nickssen	[02:02:36] (good youtube channel)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frelleck	[02:03:51] I hadn't heard of that one actually
2021-07-18 20:21:09	paulo_	[02:54:57] hi, is there a book you can suggest for elliptic curves?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	paulo_	[02:55:06] I have college level math (calculus)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[03:05:34] Maybe Silverman/Tate
2021-07-18 20:21:09	paulo_	[03:06:57] loopspace: thanks
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[03:07:59] loopspace: going from calculus to silverman seems.. cruel
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[03:08:11] (or maybe I've gone soft. idk)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	loopspace	[03:09:14] Utm version not that bad was it?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[03:12:03] loopspace: do they explain what rings are?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	noobly`	[04:38:38] given a real reimann integrable and bounded function in [a,b], I'm asked to show that a function g(x), defined as the integral of f(x) from x to b (for x in [a,b]), is continuous. this is obvious to me since the integral doesn't care much if it's integrand isn't continuous; it will continuously return real values regardless. my trouble is in converting this to a proper arguement.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	greenbagels	[05:01:18] noobly`: remember the formal definition of continuity
2021-07-18 20:21:09	noobly`	[05:04:51] greenbagels: is the squeeze theorem not relevant? someone else told me that was where to look. I'm inclined to think you're right, but I think I'm missing an easier path given that it was stated f(x) is bounded
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rsonx	[06:23:11] this text https://i.imgur.com/cKGxteh.png says that there are two conditions for DPDA. What about PDA being in state q, reading 'a' on input and reading no symbol from the stack. will that also not result in non-determinism.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jmnbtslsQE	[06:45:21] noobly`: without loss of generality can you get within epsilon of the integral at x from one side ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jmnbtslsQE	[06:47:02] where x is some fixed point that you want to show continuity at
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jmnbtslsQE	[06:47:52] maybe better to call it x_0
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jmnbtslsQE	[06:48:56] if x_1<x_0, |g(x_1) - g(x_0)| is the integral from x_1 to x_0 of f, and f is bounded
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[07:06:56] rsonx: Those symbols are not amazingly meaningful without context of how they're being used. I can probably guess, but it would be nice not to have to guess.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	tusko	[07:07:24] say we have a DE given by M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0 that is exact. Does the solution we find \Phi(x,y) = ... = C give the level curves for any choice of C that is defined?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	tusko	[07:07:49] Or is this what the explicit solution y(t) gives or what?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[07:09:13] phi(x,y) = C does give level curves for phi, which corresponds to possible trajectories for (x,y)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[07:10:27] Particular solutions may only trace out subsets of those level curves, though.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	tusko	[07:12:47] Ok, that's what I was thinking. Once we solve for the particular solution, by plugging y and x values into phi(x,y) we effectively collapse ourselves down to one trajectory on that surface?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[07:13:17] Yes, the initial values will (usually) yield a particular solution.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[09:25:24] Hello
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[09:27:00] if the canonical projection pi:G -> G/N, with N normal subgroup of G is restricted to a subngroup H. What's the Kernel of the mapping?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:31:33] so you have H <= G, and want to know ker pi|_H
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:32:07] i imagine we should split this into two, maybe 3 cases. N <= H, H <= N and neither maybe
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:32:21] at least to start working on the problem
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[09:32:57] let H an arbitrary subgroup of G
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:33:10] I think since H <= G,  H cap N <| H  or something like this
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lisp123	[09:35:13] My brain is wracking me, is a < b same as b > a?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:35:22] yes they are the same
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lisp123	[09:35:32] riv: thanks :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[09:36:03] the identity element in G/N is N, right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:36:11] yes
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[09:37:38] so pi|_H : h -> hN
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[09:39:35] ok so in order to ger hN = N you need an 'h', which is in N
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:39:53] so kernel pi = { g in G | gN = N } = N
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:40:20] and kernel pi|_H = { h in H | hN = N } = ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	riv	[09:40:39] yes, something in H and in N
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[10:15:59] cadmio: note that if you have two sets A and B, the set A n B = { x | x in A and x in B}
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[10:17:26] sure, that was the Ker
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[10:18:29] cadmio: here's a 'fun' exercise, let G be a group and consider the map inv: G -> G given by inv(g) = g^{-1}
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[10:18:35] cadmio: when is this a group homomorphism?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	HisShadow	[10:19:12] Fangs: when the group is commutative?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[10:22:29] HisShadow: spoilers!
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[10:22:49] you ruined my groupical groups punch line
2021-07-18 20:21:09	HisShadow	[10:23:04] Fangs: groupical groups?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[10:23:39] HisShadow: a group object in the category of groups

2021-07-18 20:21:09	HisShadow	[10:27:22] doesn't load right now :(
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[10:30:36] darn
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[10:30:40] here's another 'fun' exercise: Let G = Z24, H = ⟨ [2]⟩, and N = ⟨[6]⟩, what's H/N ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[10:37:29] N = {[6],[12],[18],[24]}, right?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[10:43:15] sure
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[10:48:16] the elements of G/N are the gN
2021-07-18 20:21:09	menace	[11:07:16] when there are theorem provers, are there also theorem/proof DISprovers? like, when i throw something at it, can it say, hey, no, that ist wrong? it does not have to show an error, but it would be interesting to see, if sth can prove errors in calculations or theorems.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[11:17:50] I'm not sure whether to multiply or add the element of G and N in to get one in G/N
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:22:08] cadmio: well, if H is <[2]> = {[0],[2],[4], ...,[22]}, and N = <[6]> = {[0],[6],[12],[18]}, then H/N = {all the cosets  h + H, as h ranges over H} = {([0] + N) + N, ([2] + N) + N ,([4] + N) + N, ..., ([22] + N) + N} = {[0] + N, [2] + N, [4] + N, ..., [22] + N}, but the first three of those are the same as the next three (respectively) and then the same as the next three and then the same as the last three.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[11:23:10] H/N isn't made by hN elements?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:23:17] because  [0] + N = [6] + N = [12] + N = [18] + N ,  and  [2] + N = [8] + N = [14] + N = [20] + N,   etc.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:23:58] oh sorry, yeah, I shouldn't have used  [.] + N  as those H elements
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:24:17] H/N is simply {all  h + N :  h in H}
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:24:44] so that's    {[0] + N, [2] + N, [4] + N, ..., [22] + N}
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:24:58] additive notation being the usual thing here
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[11:25:05] the canonical projection maps h ->Nh
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[11:25:23] is the product in Nh an addition?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:26:08] you can choose either notation, but if you are calling the things in Z_24  [0], [2],  etc. then it's typical to use additive notation
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:26:23] i put into wolfram alpha something to solve, and it replied with a strange operator i don't know: # -- what's that? and, what about Root[] ? it means to find the roots of the function? e.g. when x==0?

2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[11:27:40] # means a free formal variable, like x
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[11:28:40] The notation f=#^2+#-3& means a function with one argument, returning f(x)=x^2+x-3
2021-07-18 20:21:09	johnkeats6	[11:28:58] rendar, https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/19035/what-does-mean-in-mathematica
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:29:39] yes cherim, and if s is just an unknown symbolic quantity, that gives something that would need a general quintic formula, that doesn't exist.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:29:52] Do you know what s is?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cherim_	[11:30:11] It was not me who asked the question
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:30:31] oops
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:37:30] rendar, rearranging the equation you asked it to solve and renaming 1 + y to x, it becomes    100x^5 - sx^4 - sx^3 - sx^2 - sx - s = 0     There's no closed form for solutions of that for x in terms of s, using just radicals.  That's why WA gave you that answer.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[11:42:46] I'm not sure on why [6] + N = [12] + N
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:44:06] i see
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:44:41] Z-module: if i can set s to some real number, x will be the only unknown
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:44:47] cadmio: becauase [6] and [12] differ by something in N
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:44:54] in such a case, i need to solve a 5th polynomials..
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:45:12] i guess with the Newton Method or such algorithms
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:45:13] rendar, for most specific numeric s you give, it won't have a radicals-closed-form solution.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:45:25] for a few specific rationals it will
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:46:23] (or at least can)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:48:06] Z-module https://imgur.com/TI29zr4 check this out, wolfram alpha is smart enough to solve for y
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:48:16] but if i have to solve it programmatically, how could i do that?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:48:19] e.g. in python
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cadmio	[11:49:02] ok so H/N = {N, [2]+N, [4]+N} ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[11:49:09] that's a very difficult question to answer
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:49:13] yes cadmio
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[11:49:38] oh nvm
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[11:50:03] rendar: there are numerical algorithms, one "family" of them are based on newton's algorithm
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:50:14] Fangs: uhm, i see
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:50:29] Fangs: what is the best method to solve quickly those polynomials, in your opinion?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:50:39] rendar: those way equal-signs after each y there means "approximately". Sure, it's approximate numeric solutions; a trivial matter.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:51:03] (well, straightforward anyhow)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:51:17] ok
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[11:51:29] there's no best method. if you need to do this practically I'd import some numerical math library and use w/e is available
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:51:45] there's an entire literature on efficient numeric approximate roots of polynomials.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Fangs	[11:51:51] (and also I don't know much about them)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:52:25] ok
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[11:53:29] rendar: by the way, in your original thing, if s happens to be -100, there are simple closed-form roots.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:57:04] Z-module: point is that i have to find roots for a very large number of different 's'
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rendar	[11:57:12] so i need a basic approach to check that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[12:18:36] noobly: the boundedness of your f is what makes that g continuous: if |f(x)| <= M for all x in the interval, then integrating f across a narrow epsilon-width subinterval can't move the needle by more than M*epsilon.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Z-module	[12:18:50] (in either direction)

2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:41:10] https://imgur.com/a/4452uPo       this is the kind of proof he wants, (the part it says "prop")
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:41:15] it's something of the form: as y -- > x,  you have y - x --> 0, so ||y - x|| --> 0, so ||y - x||^(alpha) --> 0, so ||f(y) - f(x)|| ---> 0, so f(y) ---> f(x).
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:41:21] but how you do that depends what you're given
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:41:39] you could just do deltas and epsilons like dude12312414 suggested
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:41:39] i found this "reverse" triangle inequality
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:41:46] i think i could use that
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:41:59] that gives that ||x|| is continuous
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:42:01] those always destroy me hehe
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:42:12] I have developed allergies to e-d limits
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:42:46] if you start with ||y - x|| < delta you should end out with ||f(y) - f(x)|| < K delta^(alpha)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:42:58] see if you can prove that and then turn it into a delta epsilon
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:43:55] will do
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:44:05] gonna see if i can convince you with reverse triangle f
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:45:23] https://imgur.com/a/w71SMBp
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:45:30] does this  make sense to you?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:49:14] you don't really need the last part
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:49:30] with the reverse triangle inequality
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:49:40] and before that you are assuming the limit exists, but you don't know that
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:50:15] but if K and alpha are positive and
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:50:31] K||x-y||^alpha goes to 0
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:50:42] so by squeeze theorem the middle should too right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:51:04] or not necesarilly?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:51:05] you should add that statement
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:51:13] just saying it needs to be justified
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:51:58] so first say 0 <= ||f(x) - f(y)|| <= K||x - y||^(alpha)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:52:04] then use the squeeze theorem to justify
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:52:24] (if you're allowed that)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:54:03] right right
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:54:20] so then with that I conclude lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:54:26] yeah
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:54:29] but i still need to prove continuity
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:55:00] so i need to take the argument of that norm apart to form the lim x->y   f(x) = f(y)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:55:05] that's the definition of continuity
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:55:08] (almost)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:55:27] you should have a statement that lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0 is equivalent to f(x) --> f(y)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:55:52] thats where I thought the triangle boi could be used
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:56:11] to me it seems to do it but im a noob so i go to the powerful frelleck
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:56:18] nah the norms converging isn't enough
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:56:51] you could have (1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (1,-1),...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:57:43] hmph
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:58:07] it's just that lim ||a_n|| = 0 implies lim a_n = 0 basically
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[01:58:23] ahh
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:58:26] applied to ||f(x_n) - f(y)|| for any x_n converging to y
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:58:31] you have to have it in some form somehow
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[02:00:43] how do you remember all this
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[02:01:11] I have a vast mind
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Nickssen	[02:01:43]  lightning bolt capability

2021-07-19 11:15:18	noobly`	[04:38:38] given a real reimann integrable and bounded function in [a,b], I'm asked to show that a function g(x), defined as the integral of f(x) from x to b (for x in [a,b]), is continuous. this is obvious to me since the integral doesn't care much if it's integrand isn't continuous; it will continuously return real values regardless. my trouble is in converting this to a proper arguement.

2021-07-19 11:15:18	noobly`	[05:04:51] greenbagels: is the squeeze theorem not relevant? someone else told me that was where to look. I'm inclined to think you're right, but I think I'm missing an easier path given that it was stated f(x) is bounded
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rsonx	[06:23:11] this text https://i.imgur.com/cKGxteh.png says that there are two conditions for DPDA. What about PDA being in state q, reading 'a' on input and reading no symbol from the stack. will that also not result in non-determinism.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	jmnbtslsQE	[06:45:21] noobly`: without loss of generality can you get within epsilon of the integral at x from one side ?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	jmnbtslsQE	[06:47:02] where x is some fixed point that you want to show continuity at
2021-07-19 11:15:18	jmnbtslsQE	[06:47:52] maybe better to call it x_0
2021-07-19 11:15:18	jmnbtslsQE	[06:48:56] if x_1<x_0, |g(x_1) - g(x_0)| is the integral from x_1 to x_0 of f, and f is bounded
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[07:06:56] rsonx: Those symbols are not amazingly meaningful without context of how they're being used. I can probably guess, but it would be nice not to have to guess.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	tusko	[07:07:24] say we have a DE given by M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0 that is exact. Does the solution we find \Phi(x,y) = ... = C give the level curves for any choice of C that is defined?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	tusko	[07:07:49] Or is this what the explicit solution y(t) gives or what?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[07:09:13] phi(x,y) = C does give level curves for phi, which corresponds to possible trajectories for (x,y)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[07:10:27] Particular solutions may only trace out subsets of those level curves, though.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	tusko	[07:12:47] Ok, that's what I was thinking. Once we solve for the particular solution, by plugging y and x values into phi(x,y) we effectively collapse ourselves down to one trajectory on that surface?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[07:13:17] Yes, the initial values will (usually) yield a particular solution.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[09:25:24] Hello
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[09:27:00] if the canonical projection pi:G -> G/N, with N normal subgroup of G is restricted to a subngroup H. What's the Kernel of the mapping?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:31:33] so you have H <= G, and want to know ker pi|_H
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:32:07] i imagine we should split this into two, maybe 3 cases. N <= H, H <= N and neither maybe
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:32:21] at least to start working on the problem
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[09:32:57] let H an arbitrary subgroup of G
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:33:10] I think since H <= G,  H cap N <| H  or something like this
2021-07-19 11:15:18	lisp123	[09:35:13] My brain is wracking me, is a < b same as b > a?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:35:22] yes they are the same
2021-07-19 11:15:18	lisp123	[09:35:32] riv: thanks :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[09:36:03] the identity element in G/N is N, right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:36:11] yes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[09:37:38] so pi|_H : h -> hN
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[09:39:35] ok so in order to ger hN = N you need an 'h', which is in N
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:39:53] so kernel pi = { g in G | gN = N } = N
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:40:20] and kernel pi|_H = { h in H | hN = N } = ?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[09:40:39] yes, something in H and in N
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:15:59] cadmio: note that if you have two sets A and B, the set A n B = { x | x in A and x in B}
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[10:17:26] sure, that was the Ker
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:18:29] cadmio: here's a 'fun' exercise, let G be a group and consider the map inv: G -> G given by inv(g) = g^{-1}
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:18:35] cadmio: when is this a group homomorphism?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	HisShadow	[10:19:12] Fangs: when the group is commutative?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:22:29] HisShadow: spoilers!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:22:49] you ruined my groupical groups punch line
2021-07-19 11:15:18	HisShadow	[10:23:04] Fangs: groupical groups?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:23:39] HisShadow: a group object in the category of groups
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:24:42] HisShadow: https://web.archive.org/web/20170703232623/https://structuresheaf.blogspot.com/2017/06/happy-tau-day-and-modest-renaming.html
2021-07-19 11:15:18	HisShadow	[10:27:22] doesn't load right now :(
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:30:36] darn
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[10:30:40] here's another 'fun' exercise: Let G = Z24, H = ⟨ [2]⟩, and N = ⟨[6]⟩, what's H/N ?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[10:37:29] N = {[6],[12],[18],[24]}, right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[10:43:15] sure
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[10:48:16] the elements of G/N are the gN
2021-07-19 11:15:18	menace	[11:07:16] when there are theorem provers, are there also theorem/proof DISprovers? like, when i throw something at it, can it say, hey, no, that ist wrong? it does not have to show an error, but it would be interesting to see, if sth can prove errors in calculations or theorems.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[11:17:50] I'm not sure whether to multiply or add the element of G and N in to get one in G/N
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:22:08] cadmio: well, if H is <[2]> = {[0],[2],[4], ...,[22]}, and N = <[6]> = {[0],[6],[12],[18]}, then H/N = {all the cosets  h + H, as h ranges over H} = {([0] + N) + N, ([2] + N) + N ,([4] + N) + N, ..., ([22] + N) + N} = {[0] + N, [2] + N, [4] + N, ..., [22] + N}, but the first three of those are the same as the next three (respectively) and then the same as the next three and then the same as the last three.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[11:23:10] H/N isn't made by hN elements?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:23:17] because  [0] + N = [6] + N = [12] + N = [18] + N ,  and  [2] + N = [8] + N = [14] + N = [20] + N,   etc.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:23:58] oh sorry, yeah, I shouldn't have used  [.] + N  as those H elements
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:24:17] H/N is simply {all  h + N :  h in H}
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:24:44] so that's    {[0] + N, [2] + N, [4] + N, ..., [22] + N}
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:24:58] additive notation being the usual thing here
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[11:25:05] the canonical projection maps h ->Nh
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[11:25:23] is the product in Nh an addition?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:26:08] you can choose either notation, but if you are calling the things in Z_24  [0], [2],  etc. then it's typical to use additive notation
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:26:23] i put into wolfram alpha something to solve, and it replied with a strange operator i don't know: # -- what's that? and, what about Root[] ? it means to find the roots of the function? e.g. when x==0?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:26:24] https://imgur.com/NWLgycM
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cherim_	[11:27:40] # means a free formal variable, like x
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cherim_	[11:28:40] The notation f=#^2+#-3& means a function with one argument, returning f(x)=x^2+x-3
2021-07-19 11:15:18	johnkeats6	[11:28:58] rendar, https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/19035/what-does-mean-in-mathematica
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:29:39] yes cherim, and if s is just an unknown symbolic quantity, that gives something that would need a general quintic formula, that doesn't exist.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:29:52] Do you know what s is?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cherim_	[11:30:11] It was not me who asked the question
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:30:31] oops
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:37:30] rendar, rearranging the equation you asked it to solve and renaming 1 + y to x, it becomes    100x^5 - sx^4 - sx^3 - sx^2 - sx - s = 0     There's no closed form for solutions of that for x in terms of s, using just radicals.  That's why WA gave you that answer.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[11:42:46] I'm not sure on why [6] + N = [12] + N
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:44:06] i see
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:44:41] Z-module: if i can set s to some real number, x will be the only unknown
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:44:47] cadmio: becauase [6] and [12] differ by something in N
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:44:54] in such a case, i need to solve a 5th polynomials..
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:45:12] i guess with the Newton Method or such algorithms
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:45:13] rendar, for most specific numeric s you give, it won't have a radicals-closed-form solution.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:45:25] for a few specific rationals it will
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:46:23] (or at least can)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:48:06] Z-module https://imgur.com/TI29zr4 check this out, wolfram alpha is smart enough to solve for y
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:48:16] but if i have to solve it programmatically, how could i do that?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:48:19] e.g. in python
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cadmio	[11:49:02] ok so H/N = {N, [2]+N, [4]+N} ?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[11:49:09] that's a very difficult question to answer
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:49:13] yes cadmio
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[11:49:38] oh nvm
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[11:50:03] rendar: there are numerical algorithms, one "family" of them are based on newton's algorithm
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:50:14] Fangs: uhm, i see
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:50:29] Fangs: what is the best method to solve quickly those polynomials, in your opinion?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:50:39] rendar: those way equal-signs after each y there means "approximately". Sure, it's approximate numeric solutions; a trivial matter.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:51:03] (well, straightforward anyhow)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:51:17] ok
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[11:51:29] there's no best method. if you need to do this practically I'd import some numerical math library and use w/e is available
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:51:45] there's an entire literature on efficient numeric approximate roots of polynomials.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[11:51:51] (and also I don't know much about them)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:52:25] ok
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[11:53:29] rendar: by the way, in your original thing, if s happens to be -100, there are simple closed-form roots.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:57:04] Z-module: point is that i have to find roots for a very large number of different 's'
2021-07-19 11:15:18	rendar	[11:57:12] so i need a basic approach to check that
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[12:18:36] noobly: the boundedness of your f is what makes that g continuous: if |f(x)| <= M for all x in the interval, then integrating f across a narrow epsilon-width subinterval can't move the needle by more than M*epsilon.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[12:18:50] (in either direction)

2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[15:55:36] weird
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[15:58:51] mouseghost that's graph theory 101
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[15:59:00] euler cycle I think
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[15:59:12] eulerian
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:01:29] qedders, ye but like, idk why the book author decided to say "now we equipped to solve that" just after introducing a generalization for max edges in k-component graphs
2021-07-19 11:15:18	buster	[16:02:02] hi mouseghost. there are more bridges in kaliningrad now than there were then. which theorem?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[16:02:02] well time to read the rest of the book
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:02:14] wait konigsberg is kaliningrad?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[16:02:14] you can read it in a walk through combinatorics, I like that book
2021-07-19 11:15:18	buster	[16:02:21] yep
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[16:02:22] or in the douglas west book
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[16:02:29] introdcuction to graph theory
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:02:40] hmm i was looking at, lemme see the title
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:03:17] NARSINGH DEO "Graph Theory with applications to engineering and computer science" ;v
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:04:05] but okie, ill look at the books by authors with more pronouncable names
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cherim__	[16:04:05] The most difficult thing with the Konigsberg bridges for me was figuring out whether the author was joking or not
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[16:04:16] I solved a 10 year old problem of douglas west a few months ago, it will be online in the elecronic journal of combinatorics in 2-3 weeks
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:04:26] wo nice
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cherim__	[16:04:34] It was 1736, about the same time Euler could do pentagonal theorem
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cherim__	[16:04:55] The disparity between technical levels of that and of 7 bridges is so huge
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cherim__	[16:05:39] I always though it's some hoax, and nobody ever considered the bridges above kids level
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:05:53] buster, are these bridges in the same place, though? or in some other parts of the city?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	|smlckz|	[16:06:15] qedders: which problem?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	buster	[16:06:24] i don't know, i'd have to check. google earth?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qedders	[16:07:47] |smlckz| the main conjecture in https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v16i1r7
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:08:16] now i want a postcard from there lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	buster	[16:08:45] mouseghost, as far as I remember, the problem is even less interesting today
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:08:58] yeah so apparently the more pronouncable name, though not quite, author, actually made it without confusing me; thanks a lot
2021-07-19 11:15:18	buster	[16:09:13] great :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[16:09:30] well, i am looking from a perspective of a hs-er who will do graph theory 101 :D

2021-07-19 11:15:18	RedNifre	[19:21:22] It seems unlikely, given that 7 is prime and month have weird lengths, huh?

2021-07-19 11:15:18	RedNifre	[19:35:44] Hm... let's simplify it to just knowing the month... then you have 12 weeks that move between months. There are 7 different starts of the week, adding leap years makes 14 different weeks... learning 162 bits of look up table seems not feasible.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	RedNifre	[19:36:40] Well, leap years don't matter that much, you would just use a different table for mid february to the end of the year, so 84 bits to remember?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	RedNifre	[19:37:12] Maybe it's easier to create a custom watch face for the smart watch that displays the week number :/
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[19:37:14] RedNifre, doomsday algorithm maybe
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pikapika	[19:48:38] RedNifre, do you have a sidereal clock?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mornfall	[19:58:08] riv: different problem
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[19:59:02] argh i hate calendars
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[19:59:06] and clocks also
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mornfall	[19:59:35] who doesn't
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mornfall	[19:59:42] it's hard to come up with something more convoluted
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[20:00:06] leap seconds :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[20:00:35] they literally can't even be predicted, they are just agreed upon by a comittee from measuring the actual length of each earth day
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[20:03:00] :_:
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mornfall	[20:03:20] i don't think anybody who was around when timekeeping and calendars were being settled had any inkling that rotation of Earth randomly deviates by tiny fractions of a second from revolution to revolution
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[20:03:26] RedNifre: it's messy, but haven't we done this before?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[20:04:53] we haven't had a leap second since 2016, so should get some soon
2021-07-19 11:15:18	RedNifre	[20:06:02] int-e: Huh?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	RedNifre	[20:07:10] Well, I think the doomsday algorithm could work, if you remembered 7 different lookup tables with 12 entries each, telling you which of the month-edge weeks fall into which month.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mornfall	[20:07:21] riv: time to strap some rockets to the equator so that we can have an anti-leap second
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[20:08:52] RedNifre: Maybe it was a different person with the same kind of problem. It happens.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[20:08:53] hahaha
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[20:08:57] that sa great way to solve the problem
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cherim__	[20:12:40] Which way?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[20:41:02] is the pair (S,Sigma) (where Sigma is a sigma-algebra on S) called a measurable space because a measure can always be shown to exist given those two objects?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[20:41:57] i vaguely recall something called the counting measure; isn't that a measure that works for any measurable space?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[20:43:37] ah, it is
2021-07-19 11:15:18	blackfield	[21:09:54] from Bruckner: one often uses the terminology "(X,M) is a measurable space" to suggest the possibility that there are many measures nu that make (X,M,nu) into a measure space (albeit the terminology in other languages might not reflect this nuance i'm afraid)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[21:10:46] that makes sense
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[21:11:10] i think a measure theory book probably hits the nuances right, this is just the "tl;dr:" definitions from a probability text
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[21:17:49] what is the categorical intuition behind closed sets
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[21:23:36] or i suppose, more generally: open/closed maps
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[21:24:49] what's an open map?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[21:25:03] nvm found wiki page on it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	loopspace	[21:25:05] Coequalizers maybe have some connection
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[21:52:25] i was thinking of it in terms of a topos, with object classifiers and maps to the spirspenski space
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[21:52:46] Sierpiński*
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[21:53:17] because one of the main characteristics of an open subset is that its charasteristic map to the Sierpiński space is continuous, right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[21:55:52] wow !! why did nobody tell me this before
2021-07-19 11:15:18	riv	[21:55:56] that's really interesting
2021-07-19 11:15:18	johnkeats6	[22:08:40] i like to think of open sets as 'if you take a point and nudge it a little you're still in the set'
2021-07-19 11:15:18	johnkeats6	[22:08:48] but you do you :p
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:21:46] johnkeats6: yeah but this is response to my earlier question of thinking about open subsets in a categorial sense
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:22:31] e.g. i just read a friends proof of the following: "Suppose X,Y are topological spaces and Y is hausdorf. Let f,g:X->Y. Prove {x\in X: f(x)=g(x)} is closed"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:23:00] which i think would be very easy to prove using diagrams in category theory
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:23:11] that is if i knew how to represent closed/open subsets
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:24:23] (not that it's _necessarily_ that difficult using classical logic, i just think it'd be a fun exercise)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	tempate	[22:30:26] I'm guessing the open ball representation doesn't suit your needs?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:33:51] well that wouldn't make much sense, right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:33:55] how would you represent an open ball
2021-07-19 11:15:18	johnkeats6	[22:35:10] Y is hausdorff iff the diagonal is closed in YxY. your thing is the pullback of the diagonal under (f, g) : X --> Y x Y
2021-07-19 11:15:18	johnkeats6	[22:35:36] (f, g) is continuous, and so pre-image of a closed set is closed
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:37:11] wow
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pounce	[22:37:16] thank you :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	johnkeats6	[22:37:45] np, if i can get someone to not use category theory, it's an honest day's work
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dude12312414	[22:40:50] does it count if i never used it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pikapika	[22:46:46] how did people make angle instruments before jesse ramsden?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:37:41] Hey guys I just tried to integrate some function with sin and cos functions, using substitution method, but the result is not the same as WolframAlpha. could somebody help me look for a mistake in my initial part here? https://imgur.com/a/gQVFkHq
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:38:21] the later part of the integration I already verified to be fine, so I assume the mistake must be here
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:40:11] the final result I got was: -1/2 * cos(x)^2 + 1/2 * log(cos(x)^2+1)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:40:24] but the WolframAlpha result is: 1/4(2log(cos(2x)+3)-cos(2x))
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[23:40:56] isnt it that these can differ with c?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[23:40:58] idk
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:41:25] yea there is a C constant in the end of both results there
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:42:05] but there is no constant that makes the two results equivalent so it's a difference of more than a constant
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[23:42:47] ye nvm
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:43:25] anovick: it's right
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:44:14] qergle: thank you for checking!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:44:16] integrating -y^3/(y^2+1) gives -y^2/2+ln(1+y^2)/2
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:44:32] and if you sub back in cos(x) for y, you get what you would expect.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:45:31] qergle: yep exactly what I calculated there too...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:45:44] so frustrating that WolframAlpha tells me I'm wrong :-(
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:46:21] as for W|A, check if cos(2x)=2cos^2(x)-1 makes it all work
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:46:34] ok one sec
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:47:17] (1/4)*-cos(2x) = (1/4)*(2*cos^2(x)-1) = 1/2*cos^2-1/4
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:47:36] oops, sign issue
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:47:51] (1/4)*-cos(2x) = (1/4)*(-2*cos^2(x)+1) = -1/2*cos^2+1/4
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:48:11] so now you've got a +1/4 that's off, see if you get from the other term
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[23:49:19] cant +1/4 be accounted in c tho?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mouseghost	[23:49:25] idk im not thinking
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:49:53] yes, if it's indefinite it can. anyways, work it all out
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:50:18] qergle: very well done!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:50:30] I forgot about the cos(2x) identity with cos(x)^2
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:50:38] came in handy there
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:51:12] so I guess I wasn't wrong, and the two solutions are equivalent after all...! what a relief
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[23:51:39] the balance of the universe is restored
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:51:59] my faith in myself has also been restored :-)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:58:09] I have another question... if I integrate S(cos(x)dx) from 0 to pi/2 , and then substitute y = cos(x), is the new range for S(cos(x)dx) from cos(0)=1 to cos(pi/2)=0 ?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[23:58:31] I mean for S(ydy)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[00:01:32] new limits are 0 and 1
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meingtsla	[00:02:03] cos(x) dx does not simply become y dy, though
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[00:02:18] lower limit is 1 and upper limit is 0, in your case
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[00:02:31] meingtsla: yes you're right i'm sorry for providing a contrived example there
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[00:02:37] but y=cos(x) -> dy=sin(x)dx, so your sub is off
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:02:53] the eigenspace has per definition 1 degree of freedom, i.e. the spanning basis consists out of a vector in the eigenspace
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:02:55] right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[00:03:10] qergle: yes the substitution is off I'm aware
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[00:03:33] qergle: it is important which is the lower limit and which is the upper limit right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[00:04:02] if it was from 0 to pi/2, then it should be from 1 to 0 after substitution
2021-07-19 11:15:18	anovick	[00:04:26] if I calculate from 0 to 1 it would be the negative result
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[00:05:24] yes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:06:32] CuriousErnestBro: One eigenvalue can have a more than one-dimensional eigenspace.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:07:01] E.g. the identity transformation has eigenvalue 1, and the corresponding eigenspace is the whole space.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:07:24] PlanckWalk so rickyrick just told me you'd have to solve for ker(A - lambda I), idk why you'd do that
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:07:32] To find the eigensapce
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:07:50] to attempt to obtain the (hopefully) linearly independent eigenvectors
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:08:26] PlanckWalk yes, that is clear, but how does eigenspace come from A - lambda I?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:08:26] All the (nonzero) vectors in that kernel are eigenvectors for eigenvalue lambda
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:08:52] sure, that's what the theorems state
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:09:01] A v = lambda v  iff  A v = lambda I v  iff  (A - lambda I) v = 0
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:09:08] what is the logic behind it though?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:09:15] I.e. v is in the kernel of  A - lambda I
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:09:48] is the matrix -vector product distributive and commutative?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:10:03] yes. no.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:10:11] Distributive, yes, and is commutative for addition
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:10:19] (But not for multiplication)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:21] and subtraction
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:27] that's what you use here
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:10:31] No, I don't
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:10:35] suutraction is not commutative either
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:10:41] Nowhere do I use  A - B = B - A
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:51] oh
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:11:07] ok, you do use distributive though right
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:11:10] Yes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:11:26] (A - B) v = A v - B v
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:12:02] That comes from the transformation being linear.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:12:41] there's also this associativity-like property of multiplication by a scalar... lambda (I v) = (lambda I) v
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:12:49] Well, I suppose it's also the fact that the space of transformations is itself linear.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:13:08] I also remember something with a determinant in eigenvalue/vector stuff
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:13:36] Yes, you often use determinant (in principle) to find eigenvalues
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:13:36] ok so v ∈ Ker(A - λI) iff Av=λv
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:14:07] det(A - lambda I) != 0 would imply that Av = lambda v only for v = 0
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:14:22] while det(A - lambda I) = 0 ensures a non-empty kernel
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:14:33] so there are eigenvectors corresponding to lambda
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:14:47] that's the determinant connection
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:14:50] ahh
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:07] determinant measures the volume
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:08] that's why
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:46] det(A - λI) != 0 => empty nullspace of A-λI
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:58] because the matrix transformation preserves its volume
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:18:02] so I guess it's possible to have no eigenvalues?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:19:44] you always have complex eigenvalues but there can be no real eigenvalues
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:19:48] Well, if A is an nxn matrix then det(A - λI) is a polynomial of degree n in λ. If you're working over an algebraically complete field like the complex numbers, that gives you n eigenvalues (not necessarily distinct)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[00:19:49] [0 -1;1 0] has no evalues over R
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:20:24] so having an eigenvalue means that your linear transformation matrix A is kind of degenerate in the sense that the "range" can have less "degrees of freedom" than the domain
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[00:20:26] you can come up with many quadratics with no real roots, that was just a simple one
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:14] int-e idk what a "field" is
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:21] I guess it's not important
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:21:28] A - λI  is "degenerate", but A doesn't need to be
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:40] hmmm
2021-07-19 11:15:18	PlanckWalk	[00:21:42] A is "degenerate" if it has 0 as an eigenvalue
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:22:02] wait a second
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:22:09] degenerate means there's a nonzero vector v with Av = 0
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:22:14] equivalently it's not one to one
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:22:25] people consider that "degenerate" behavior
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:22:42] idk I just came up with the term "degenerate"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:22:53] heh well that's real terminology
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:20] I guess the real terminology would be non invertible
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:28] because you lose info you can't get back
2021-07-19 11:15:18	buster	[00:23:33] or singular
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:23:33] right
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:48] singular is a synonym for non invertible afaik
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[00:24:30] singular means odd or out-of-the-ordinary
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:24:45] in a nonmathematical setting, qergle
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:24:48] oh, I always found that term to be odd
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:24:50] (lol)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	qergle	[00:25:08] frelleck: yes, and i believe that's the mathematical etymology. det()=0 is rare.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:25:36] so a λ of 0 would mean there's an eigenspace that is the number 0
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:25:38] {0}
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:25:53] eigenvalue is zero
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:26:05] eigenspace is the span of one or more nonzero vectors
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:26:28] is the eigenspace defined on the domain or range?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	buster	[00:26:29] if anything, {0} is the eigenspace corresponding to all the non-eigenvalues
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mandanguita	[00:26:33] Hello, I want to show that if {(x_n, y_n)} is a sequence in the prehilbert space H1xH2 that converges to (x, y) in H1xH2, then {(x_b)} -> x in H1
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:27:23] buster if by non-eigenvalues you mean λ=0 then yes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mandanguita	[00:27:44] the solution it says that it is enought to see that ||x_n - x||_1 <= ||(x_n, y_n) - (x, y)||, but I don't know where this inequality comes from
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:23] Thank you all for teaching me
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:34] I will probably die before I know where det() comes from
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:28:44] mandanguita: how is ||.|| defined for H1xH2?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:44] it is enough to know it's a volume measurement
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:50] time to move on with my life :D
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mandanguita	[00:29:11] int-e: ||(x,y)|| = sqrt(||x||_1^2+||y||_2^2)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:29:34] mandanguita: so you're asking why ||x||_1 <= sqrt(||x||_1^2 + ||y||_2^2)?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mandanguita	[00:31:25] I see
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[00:33:22] hi
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[00:34:37] natural integers form a group under addition, right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[00:34:52] paulo_: what's the inverse operation?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[00:34:53] no
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[00:49:55] but they do form a monoid, if you include 0 in that set
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[00:55:09] if I include 0 and negative numbers?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[00:55:31] each element's inverse is it's negative
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[00:55:36] and the identify element is 0
2021-07-19 11:15:18	CuriousErnestBro	[00:56:55] most math books, like most math students, are mediocre
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:11:08] paulo_: if it has all positive and negative integers and 0, that is just "Z", or "the integers".  You wouldn't call that the "natural integers" because we have a term "natural numbers" to mean only the positive ones, or the non-negative ones, in an alternate meaning.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:11:20] but yes, Z with addition is a group
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:13:06] Simple exercise I read recently, that never seems to come anywhere (maybe it's too easy): Show that if A is an abelian group all of whose proper nonzero subgroups are =~ Z, then A =~ Z.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:13:34] (also, A is infinite so it does *have* some proper nonzero subgroups)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	alphamul2	[01:19:30] I'll make an extended hypothesis:  Like most real numbers are irrational, most possible books are nonsense.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	alphamul2	[01:19:35] :D
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:21:54] I can think of a Zorn's lemma proof Z-module
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:22:13] just order the proper subgroups by inclusion and choose a maximal subgroup
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:22:40] I should say proper subgroups along with the whole group
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:23:13] hm something along those lines
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:23:43] I dunno maybe I'm being dumb
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	frelleck [01:23:55] goes back to simple activities
2021-07-19 11:15:18	alphamul2	[01:24:22] For 0<x,1, no overlap of say 0.90 and 0.9:   2-digit numbers are 10 times as common as 1-digit numbers.  3-digit numbers are 10 times as common as 2-digit numbers.  And so on.  <---  Isn't ths this true?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	alphamul2	[01:24:41] Oh right
2021-07-19 11:15:18	alphamul2	[01:24:45] actually, 9x
2021-07-19 11:15:18	alphamul2	[01:24:51] Becuase 0 case, duh
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:27:05] Z-module: I'm missing something... how does that work for {x/p^n | x in Z, n in N}?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:28:42] oh, because we can restrict x to qZ for some q != p and get a subgroup.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:28:53] *proper* subgroup
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:29:33] (those p,q are supposed to be primes)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:31:03] frelleck: why is the union of a chain of proper subgroups a *proper* subgroup?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:31:16] that's why I tacked the whole group on
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:32:21] then it all became meaningless
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:35:21] Ah, okay. I was just wondering what a proper maximal proper subgroup of Q would look like, and afaics there is none.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:35:39] int-e, yeah (well, you should say q has some prime divisor other than p)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:35:57] right, divisible abelian groups don't have maximal subgroups
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:36:20] Z-module: I don't need to say that; all the other factors come from Z in qZ.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:37:57] if q is some p^m or some -p^m, your subgroup is actually the full group
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:38:49] But this means I'm done. I can consider {x+x | x in A} which is a proper subgroup of A unless every element of A is divisible by 2; in the latter case there's a subgroup isomorphic to {x/2^n | x in Z, n in N} and we've just seen that that has a *proper* subgroup not isomorphic to Z.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:39:19] Z-module: "(those p,q are supposed to be primes)"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:40:16] oh, missed that q was supposed to be
2021-07-19 11:15:18	alphamul2	[01:42:31] A nice way to generate a list:   Increment loop starting with 1, and then place the digit in the output as OPPOSITE place.  So, 0.1,0.2,...,0.9,0.01,0.11,0.21,...,0.02,and so on.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	alphamul2	[01:43:27] As a sort of canon order to describe said situation from earlier.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:43:52] dumb question if A + A is cyclic why is A cyclic?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:44:17] I should say {x + x: x in A}
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:44:42] that's not true
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:45:12] so that might be a proper subgroup of A which is cyclic, but A itself is not
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:45:27] Yes.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[01:45:44] so why are you done? :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:45:53] Good question.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	frelleck [01:47:41] slithers off
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:47:59] frelleck: Well {x+x | x in A} is isomorphic to A unless there's an element of order 2 in A.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:48:50] Because that map is injective otherwise: x+x = y+y implies 2(x-y) = 0.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:49:34] Anyhow, the proof someone else posted, that might be too hammer-using, is:  For all nonzero a in A, either <a> = A or <a> =~ Z  so a has infinite order. We can't have nA = A for all integers n > 1, since this would make A divisible, but all nonzero torsionfree divisible groups are vector spaces over Q so those have non-cyclic nonzero proper subgroups. So say mA is a proper subgroup of A, for some fixed m > 1.  The homomorphism  x |-> mx
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:49:34] has 0 kernel since A is torsionfree, so mA =~ Z.  But also mA =~ A because of that map I just menteioned. So A =~ Z.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:52:16] frelleck: I did actually consider that part. But yeah, I didn't mention it in my (pretty rough) sketch.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:53:28] apparently there do exist (as somewhat-cousins of Tarski Monsters) nonabelian infinite groups all of whose nonzero proper subgroups are =~ Z.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:53:47] eww
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:57:08] Z-module: unpacking that... it's not all that different from my proof, except I fixed m=2 so I didn't get all of Q when mA = A.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:57:14] "a Tarski monster for the prime aleph_0"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[01:57:22] s/proof/proof sketch/
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[01:57:32] yeah, yours is more parimonious
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[02:01:06] and I'm reminded now of the occasionally handy fact that every infinite group G (including non-ab) has at least |G| many distinct subgroups.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[02:02:10] ...all cyclic...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[02:02:39] I mean, you can restrict those subgroups to be cyclic. Unless I'm missing something again?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[02:03:38] that's right
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[02:05:39] why is thathandy
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[02:07:21] when messing around the structural facts about infinite groups
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[02:07:29] i.e., "not often"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[02:09:07] Let g ~ g' iff <g> = <g'>, then all the equivalence classes are finite, so |G/~| = |G| (that's just equivalence classes, not a group quotient)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[02:09:43] And each equivalence class corresponds to a distinct cyclic subgroup of G.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	int-e	[02:10:12] (that's how the relation is constructed)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[02:10:36] oh wow, there are even uncountable nonabelian groups all of whose proper subgroups are countable.  (but abelian groups don't have this anomaly)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Z-module	[02:21:46] int-e, that ~ way is quite pretty. My unpretty way was:  If G is infinite, then either:  (i) G is countable, and (i.a) all its cyclic subgroups are finite so there have to be at least aleph_0 of those, or else (i.b) it has a subgroup =~ Z which itself has aleph_0 distinct subroups;    or    (ii) G is uncountable in which case there must be |G| many distinct cyclic subgroups since those are all countable.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[02:22:05] are you guys working on a problem?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Fangs	[02:23:20] Z-module: I think you can say a lot of stuff about profinite groups, so I wouldn't count 'structural facts abotu infinite groups' as inherently something that doesn't come up often
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[02:50:45] > Warning. Intuition is usually OK for finite measures, and adapts well for sigma-finite measures. However, measures which are not sigma-finite can be crazy; fortunately, there are no such measures in this book.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[02:51:02] Do non-sigma-finite measures come up often in other fields like real analysis or something?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Galois	[02:59:24] the usual example of a non-sigma-finite measure is: you want to assign probabilities to a countable set of events, such that any single event has probability 0, but the entire set has probability 1.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Galois	[02:59:43] for example, "pick a random rational number in the interval [0,1]"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Galois	[03:00:09] for what should be obvious reasons, there does not exist any sigma-finite measure satisfying the stated properties
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:02:43] i think im missing the obvious reasons; wouldn't [0,1] be a countable union of intervals with finite length?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:03:30] i guess i cant really think about that, i don't exactly know what lebesgue measure is, even though i think im invoking it by talking about length
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Galois	[03:03:43] oh, sorry, I messed up. The problem is that this isn't a measure, not that it isn't a sigma-finite measure
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[03:04:50] just use the discrete measure on an uncountable set
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[03:05:02] I don't know how natural that is but it's an easy example
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:05:15] i think i might be asking this question prematurely; maybe i should get comfortable with different examples of measures before thinking about it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Galois	[03:06:33] you can also take the borel/lebesgue measure on the long line
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:06:58] its kind of cool that any countably additive function on an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the sigma algebra generated by that algebra; that seems like a strong statement to make
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:07:18] i cant wait for the appendix to hit me with a 5 page proof
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[03:07:30] it's pretty icky iirc
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[03:07:33] uses outer measures
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:08:45] it is in fact a 5 page proof
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:08:50] and does in fact use outer measures
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frelleck	[03:09:43] short but icky I guess
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:10:10] i guess short depends on how many assumptions you take for granted or include as part of the proof heh
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:10:15] lemmas, i mean
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:11:13] cauchy's integral theorem is trivial if you just use green's theorem :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mefistofeles	[03:11:48] green's theorem tastes better with a bagel, btw
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:11:54] ;)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:12:18] this does make me want to learn some measure theory before going further, since it seems like there's a lot of development im taking for granted
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:12:24] probably a rabbit hole though, ill come back to it later lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:17:33] WOAH
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:17:51] i remember my analysis text giving a first glance at the cosntruction of lebesgue measure
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:18:21] but this book just hits you with the "it's the unique measure obtained by extending the countably additive "length" function on unions of intervals"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:18:24] woaaaaah
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Galois	[03:19:23] I think that theorem is at https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/measure_theory/outer_measure.lean#L961
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Galois	[03:20:14] and yes, lean uses what you just said: def lebesgue_outer : outer_measure ℝ := outer_measure.of_function lebesgue_length lebesgue_length_empty
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:20:59] yeah my text calls it caratheodory's extension theorem
2021-07-19 11:15:18	greenbagels	[03:21:16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem

2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:41:21] but how you do that depends what you're given
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:41:39] you could just do deltas and epsilons like dude12312414 suggested
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:41:39] i found this "reverse" triangle inequality
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:41:46] i think i could use that
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:41:59] that gives that ||x|| is continuous
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:42:01] those always destroy me hehe
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:42:12] I have developed allergies to e-d limits
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:42:46] if you start with ||y - x|| < delta you should end out with ||f(y) - f(x)|| < K delta^(alpha)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:42:58] see if you can prove that and then turn it into a delta epsilon
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:43:55] will do
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:44:05] gonna see if i can convince you with reverse triangle f
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:45:23] https://imgur.com/a/w71SMBp
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:45:30] does this  make sense to you?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:49:14] you don't really need the last part
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:49:30] with the reverse triangle inequality
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:49:40] and before that you are assuming the limit exists, but you don't know that
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:50:15] but if K and alpha are positive and
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:50:31] K||x-y||^alpha goes to 0
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:50:42] so by squeeze theorem the middle should too right?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:51:04] or not necesarilly?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:51:05] you should add that statement
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:51:13] just saying it needs to be justified
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:51:58] so first say 0 <= ||f(x) - f(y)|| <= K||x - y||^(alpha)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:52:04] then use the squeeze theorem to justify
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:52:24] (if you're allowed that)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:54:03] right right
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:54:20] so then with that I conclude lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:54:26] yeah
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:54:29] but i still need to prove continuity
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:55:00] so i need to take the argument of that norm apart to form the lim x->y   f(x) = f(y)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:55:05] that's the definition of continuity
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:55:08] (almost)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:55:27] you should have a statement that lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0 is equivalent to f(x) --> f(y)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:55:52] thats where I thought the triangle boi could be used
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:56:11] to me it seems to do it but im a noob so i go to the powerful frelleck
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:56:18] nah the norms converging isn't enough
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:56:51] you could have (1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (1,-1),...
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:57:43] hmph
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:58:07] it's just that lim ||a_n|| = 0 implies lim a_n = 0 basically
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[01:58:23] ahh
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:58:26] applied to ||f(x_n) - f(y)|| for any x_n converging to y
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[01:58:31] you have to have it in some form somehow
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[02:00:43] how do you remember all this
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[02:01:11] I have a vast mind
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[02:01:43]  lightning bolt capability
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[02:02:01] I'm an AI sitting in a basement in Virginia
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[02:02:04] but enough about me
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[02:02:22] sciencephile the AI?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Nickssen	[02:02:36] (good youtube channel)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	frelleck	[02:03:51] I hadn't heard of that one actually
2021-07-19 11:45:30	paulo_	[02:54:57] hi, is there a book you can suggest for elliptic curves?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	paulo_	[02:55:06] I have college level math (calculus)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	loopspace	[03:05:34] Maybe Silverman/Tate
2021-07-19 11:45:30	paulo_	[03:06:57] loopspace: thanks
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[03:07:59] loopspace: going from calculus to silverman seems.. cruel
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[03:08:11] (or maybe I've gone soft. idk)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	loopspace	[03:09:14] Utm version not that bad was it?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[03:12:03] loopspace: do they explain what rings are?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	noobly`	[04:38:38] given a real reimann integrable and bounded function in [a,b], I'm asked to show that a function g(x), defined as the integral of f(x) from x to b (for x in [a,b]), is continuous. this is obvious to me since the integral doesn't care much if it's integrand isn't continuous; it will continuously return real values regardless. my trouble is in converting this to a proper arguement.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	greenbagels	[05:01:18] noobly`: remember the formal definition of continuity
2021-07-19 11:45:30	noobly`	[05:04:51] greenbagels: is the squeeze theorem not relevant? someone else told me that was where to look. I'm inclined to think you're right, but I think I'm missing an easier path given that it was stated f(x) is bounded
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rsonx	[06:23:11] this text https://i.imgur.com/cKGxteh.png says that there are two conditions for DPDA. What about PDA being in state q, reading 'a' on input and reading no symbol from the stack. will that also not result in non-determinism.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	jmnbtslsQE	[06:45:21] noobly`: without loss of generality can you get within epsilon of the integral at x from one side ?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	jmnbtslsQE	[06:47:02] where x is some fixed point that you want to show continuity at
2021-07-19 11:45:30	jmnbtslsQE	[06:47:52] maybe better to call it x_0
2021-07-19 11:45:30	jmnbtslsQE	[06:48:56] if x_1<x_0, |g(x_1) - g(x_0)| is the integral from x_1 to x_0 of f, and f is bounded
2021-07-19 11:45:30	PlanckWalk	[07:06:56] rsonx: Those symbols are not amazingly meaningful without context of how they're being used. I can probably guess, but it would be nice not to have to guess.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	tusko	[07:07:24] say we have a DE given by M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0 that is exact. Does the solution we find \Phi(x,y) = ... = C give the level curves for any choice of C that is defined?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	tusko	[07:07:49] Or is this what the explicit solution y(t) gives or what?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	PlanckWalk	[07:09:13] phi(x,y) = C does give level curves for phi, which corresponds to possible trajectories for (x,y)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	PlanckWalk	[07:10:27] Particular solutions may only trace out subsets of those level curves, though.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	tusko	[07:12:47] Ok, that's what I was thinking. Once we solve for the particular solution, by plugging y and x values into phi(x,y) we effectively collapse ourselves down to one trajectory on that surface?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	PlanckWalk	[07:13:17] Yes, the initial values will (usually) yield a particular solution.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[09:25:24] Hello
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[09:27:00] if the canonical projection pi:G -> G/N, with N normal subgroup of G is restricted to a subngroup H. What's the Kernel of the mapping?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:31:33] so you have H <= G, and want to know ker pi|_H
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:32:07] i imagine we should split this into two, maybe 3 cases. N <= H, H <= N and neither maybe
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:32:21] at least to start working on the problem
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[09:32:57] let H an arbitrary subgroup of G
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:33:10] I think since H <= G,  H cap N <| H  or something like this
2021-07-19 11:45:30	lisp123	[09:35:13] My brain is wracking me, is a < b same as b > a?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:35:22] yes they are the same
2021-07-19 11:45:30	lisp123	[09:35:32] riv: thanks :)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[09:36:03] the identity element in G/N is N, right?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:36:11] yes
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[09:37:38] so pi|_H : h -> hN
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[09:39:35] ok so in order to ger hN = N you need an 'h', which is in N
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:39:53] so kernel pi = { g in G | gN = N } = N
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:40:20] and kernel pi|_H = { h in H | hN = N } = ?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[09:40:39] yes, something in H and in N
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[10:15:59] cadmio: note that if you have two sets A and B, the set A n B = { x | x in A and x in B}
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[10:17:26] sure, that was the Ker
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[10:18:29] cadmio: here's a 'fun' exercise, let G be a group and consider the map inv: G -> G given by inv(g) = g^{-1}
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[10:18:35] cadmio: when is this a group homomorphism?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	HisShadow	[10:19:12] Fangs: when the group is commutative?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[10:22:29] HisShadow: spoilers!
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[10:22:49] you ruined my groupical groups punch line
2021-07-19 11:45:30	HisShadow	[10:23:04] Fangs: groupical groups?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[10:23:39] HisShadow: a group object in the category of groups

2021-07-19 11:45:30	HisShadow	[10:27:22] doesn't load right now :(
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[10:30:36] darn
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[10:30:40] here's another 'fun' exercise: Let G = Z24, H = ⟨ [2]⟩, and N = ⟨[6]⟩, what's H/N ?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[10:37:29] N = {[6],[12],[18],[24]}, right?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[10:43:15] sure
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[10:48:16] the elements of G/N are the gN
2021-07-19 11:45:30	menace	[11:07:16] when there are theorem provers, are there also theorem/proof DISprovers? like, when i throw something at it, can it say, hey, no, that ist wrong? it does not have to show an error, but it would be interesting to see, if sth can prove errors in calculations or theorems.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[11:17:50] I'm not sure whether to multiply or add the element of G and N in to get one in G/N
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:22:08] cadmio: well, if H is <[2]> = {[0],[2],[4], ...,[22]}, and N = <[6]> = {[0],[6],[12],[18]}, then H/N = {all the cosets  h + H, as h ranges over H} = {([0] + N) + N, ([2] + N) + N ,([4] + N) + N, ..., ([22] + N) + N} = {[0] + N, [2] + N, [4] + N, ..., [22] + N}, but the first three of those are the same as the next three (respectively) and then the same as the next three and then the same as the last three.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[11:23:10] H/N isn't made by hN elements?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:23:17] because  [0] + N = [6] + N = [12] + N = [18] + N ,  and  [2] + N = [8] + N = [14] + N = [20] + N,   etc.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:23:58] oh sorry, yeah, I shouldn't have used  [.] + N  as those H elements
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:24:17] H/N is simply {all  h + N :  h in H}
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:24:44] so that's    {[0] + N, [2] + N, [4] + N, ..., [22] + N}
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:24:58] additive notation being the usual thing here
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[11:25:05] the canonical projection maps h ->Nh
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[11:25:23] is the product in Nh an addition?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:26:08] you can choose either notation, but if you are calling the things in Z_24  [0], [2],  etc. then it's typical to use additive notation
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:26:23] i put into wolfram alpha something to solve, and it replied with a strange operator i don't know: # -- what's that? and, what about Root[] ? it means to find the roots of the function? e.g. when x==0?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:26:24] https://imgur.com/NWLgycM
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cherim_	[11:27:40] # means a free formal variable, like x
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cherim_	[11:28:40] The notation f=#^2+#-3& means a function with one argument, returning f(x)=x^2+x-3
2021-07-19 11:45:30	johnkeats6	[11:28:58] rendar, https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/19035/what-does-mean-in-mathematica
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:29:39] yes cherim, and if s is just an unknown symbolic quantity, that gives something that would need a general quintic formula, that doesn't exist.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:29:52] Do you know what s is?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cherim_	[11:30:11] It was not me who asked the question
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:30:31] oops
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:37:30] rendar, rearranging the equation you asked it to solve and renaming 1 + y to x, it becomes    100x^5 - sx^4 - sx^3 - sx^2 - sx - s = 0     There's no closed form for solutions of that for x in terms of s, using just radicals.  That's why WA gave you that answer.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[11:42:46] I'm not sure on why [6] + N = [12] + N
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:44:06] i see
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:44:41] Z-module: if i can set s to some real number, x will be the only unknown
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:44:47] cadmio: becauase [6] and [12] differ by something in N
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:44:54] in such a case, i need to solve a 5th polynomials..
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:45:12] i guess with the Newton Method or such algorithms
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:45:13] rendar, for most specific numeric s you give, it won't have a radicals-closed-form solution.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:45:25] for a few specific rationals it will
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:46:23] (or at least can)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:48:06] Z-module https://imgur.com/TI29zr4 check this out, wolfram alpha is smart enough to solve for y
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:48:16] but if i have to solve it programmatically, how could i do that?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:48:19] e.g. in python
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cadmio	[11:49:02] ok so H/N = {N, [2]+N, [4]+N} ?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[11:49:09] that's a very difficult question to answer
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:49:13] yes cadmio
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[11:49:38] oh nvm
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[11:50:03] rendar: there are numerical algorithms, one "family" of them are based on newton's algorithm
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:50:14] Fangs: uhm, i see
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:50:29] Fangs: what is the best method to solve quickly those polynomials, in your opinion?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:50:39] rendar: those way equal-signs after each y there means "approximately". Sure, it's approximate numeric solutions; a trivial matter.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:51:03] (well, straightforward anyhow)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:51:17] ok
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[11:51:29] there's no best method. if you need to do this practically I'd import some numerical math library and use w/e is available
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:51:45] there's an entire literature on efficient numeric approximate roots of polynomials.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Fangs	[11:51:51] (and also I don't know much about them)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:52:25] ok
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[11:53:29] rendar: by the way, in your original thing, if s happens to be -100, there are simple closed-form roots.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:57:04] Z-module: point is that i have to find roots for a very large number of different 's'
2021-07-19 11:45:30	rendar	[11:57:12] so i need a basic approach to check that
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[12:18:36] noobly: the boundedness of your f is what makes that g continuous: if |f(x)| <= M for all x in the interval, then integrating f across a narrow epsilon-width subinterval can't move the needle by more than M*epsilon.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[12:18:50] (in either direction)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[15:18:09] ff
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[15:18:12] oops

2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[15:55:34] lol i am reading a book and theyve introduced a theorem saying that it will help solving kooooonigsberg bridge problem (just duh build another bridge somewhere...) but i dont see wheres the relationship ;v
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[15:55:36] weird
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[15:58:51] mouseghost that's graph theory 101
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[15:59:00] euler cycle I think
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[15:59:12] eulerian
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:01:29] qedders, ye but like, idk why the book author decided to say "now we equipped to solve that" just after introducing a generalization for max edges in k-component graphs
2021-07-19 11:45:30	buster	[16:02:02] hi mouseghost. there are more bridges in kaliningrad now than there were then. which theorem?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[16:02:02] well time to read the rest of the book
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:02:14] wait konigsberg is kaliningrad?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[16:02:14] you can read it in a walk through combinatorics, I like that book
2021-07-19 11:45:30	buster	[16:02:21] yep
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[16:02:22] or in the douglas west book
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[16:02:29] introdcuction to graph theory
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:02:40] hmm i was looking at, lemme see the title
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:03:17] NARSINGH DEO "Graph Theory with applications to engineering and computer science" ;v
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:04:05] but okie, ill look at the books by authors with more pronouncable names
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cherim__	[16:04:05] The most difficult thing with the Konigsberg bridges for me was figuring out whether the author was joking or not
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[16:04:16] I solved a 10 year old problem of douglas west a few months ago, it will be online in the elecronic journal of combinatorics in 2-3 weeks
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:04:26] wo nice
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cherim__	[16:04:34] It was 1736, about the same time Euler could do pentagonal theorem
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cherim__	[16:04:55] The disparity between technical levels of that and of 7 bridges is so huge
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cherim__	[16:05:39] I always though it's some hoax, and nobody ever considered the bridges above kids level
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:05:53] buster, are these bridges in the same place, though? or in some other parts of the city?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	|smlckz|	[16:06:15] qedders: which problem?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	buster	[16:06:24] i don't know, i'd have to check. google earth?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	qedders	[16:07:47] |smlckz| the main conjecture in https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v16i1r7
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:08:16] now i want a postcard from there lol
2021-07-19 11:45:30	buster	[16:08:45] mouseghost, as far as I remember, the problem is even less interesting today
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:08:58] yeah so apparently the more pronouncable name, though not quite, author, actually made it without confusing me; thanks a lot
2021-07-19 11:45:30	buster	[16:09:13] great :)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[16:09:30] well, i am looking from a perspective of a hs-er who will do graph theory 101 :D
2021-07-19 11:45:30	johnkeats6	[18:29:49] yello
2021-07-19 11:45:30	Z-module	[18:31:53] hi
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[18:41:42] qedders++
2021-07-19 11:45:30	biberao	[18:46:20] hi
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[18:46:34] hi
2021-07-19 11:45:30	biberao	[18:46:41] riv: hows the pup
2021-07-19 11:45:30	biberao	[18:46:53] nvm it wasnt you
2021-07-19 11:45:30	RedNifre	[19:19:16] Is there a trick for easily relating week number (first Thursday of the year is week 1) to the regular month and day of the month format?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	RedNifre	[19:21:22] It seems unlikely, given that 7 is prime and month have weird lengths, huh?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mornfall	[19:28:22] RedNifre: in your head or using a computer?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	RedNifre	[19:34:13] In my head.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mornfall	[19:35:12] seems unlikely (calendars usually have week numbers in them tho)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	RedNifre	[19:35:44] Hm... let's simplify it to just knowing the month... then you have 12 weeks that move between months. There are 7 different starts of the week, adding leap years makes 14 different weeks... learning 162 bits of look up table seems not feasible.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	RedNifre	[19:36:40] Well, leap years don't matter that much, you would just use a different table for mid february to the end of the year, so 84 bits to remember?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	RedNifre	[19:37:12] Maybe it's easier to create a custom watch face for the smart watch that displays the week number :/
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[19:37:14] RedNifre, doomsday algorithm maybe
2021-07-19 11:45:30	pikapika	[19:48:38] RedNifre, do you have a sidereal clock?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mornfall	[19:58:08] riv: different problem
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[19:59:02] argh i hate calendars
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[19:59:06] and clocks also
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mornfall	[19:59:35] who doesn't
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mornfall	[19:59:42] it's hard to come up with something more convoluted
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[20:00:06] leap seconds :)
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[20:00:35] they literally can't even be predicted, they are just agreed upon by a comittee from measuring the actual length of each earth day
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mouseghost	[20:03:00] :_:
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mornfall	[20:03:20] i don't think anybody who was around when timekeeping and calendars were being settled had any inkling that rotation of Earth randomly deviates by tiny fractions of a second from revolution to revolution
2021-07-19 11:45:30	int-e	[20:03:26] RedNifre: it's messy, but haven't we done this before?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[20:04:53] we haven't had a leap second since 2016, so should get some soon
2021-07-19 11:45:30	RedNifre	[20:06:02] int-e: Huh?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	RedNifre	[20:07:10] Well, I think the doomsday algorithm could work, if you remembered 7 different lookup tables with 12 entries each, telling you which of the month-edge weeks fall into which month.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	mornfall	[20:07:21] riv: time to strap some rockets to the equator so that we can have an anti-leap second
2021-07-19 11:45:30	int-e	[20:08:52] RedNifre: Maybe it was a different person with the same kind of problem. It happens.
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[20:08:53] hahaha
2021-07-19 11:45:30	riv	[20:08:57] that sa great way to solve the problem
2021-07-19 11:45:30	cherim__	[20:12:40] Which way?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	greenbagels	[20:41:02] is the pair (S,Sigma) (where Sigma is a sigma-algebra on S) called a measurable space because a measure can always be shown to exist given those two objects?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	greenbagels	[20:41:57] i vaguely recall something called the counting measure; isn't that a measure that works for any measurable space?
2021-07-19 11:45:30	greenbagels	[20:43:37] ah, it is
2021-07-19 11:45:31	blackfield	[21:09:54] from Bruckner: one often uses the terminology "(X,M) is a measurable space" to suggest the possibility that there are many measures nu that make (X,M,nu) into a measure space (albeit the terminology in other languages might not reflect this nuance i'm afraid)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[21:10:46] that makes sense
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[21:11:10] i think a measure theory book probably hits the nuances right, this is just the "tl;dr:" definitions from a probability text
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[21:17:49] what is the categorical intuition behind closed sets
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[21:23:36] or i suppose, more generally: open/closed maps
2021-07-19 11:45:31	riv	[21:24:49] what's an open map?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	riv	[21:25:03] nvm found wiki page on it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	loopspace	[21:25:05] Coequalizers maybe have some connection
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[21:52:25] i was thinking of it in terms of a topos, with object classifiers and maps to the spirspenski space
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[21:52:46] Sierpiński*
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[21:53:17] because one of the main characteristics of an open subset is that its charasteristic map to the Sierpiński space is continuous, right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	riv	[21:55:52] wow !! why did nobody tell me this before
2021-07-19 11:45:31	riv	[21:55:56] that's really interesting
2021-07-19 11:45:31	johnkeats6	[22:08:40] i like to think of open sets as 'if you take a point and nudge it a little you're still in the set'
2021-07-19 11:45:31	johnkeats6	[22:08:48] but you do you :p
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:21:46] johnkeats6: yeah but this is response to my earlier question of thinking about open subsets in a categorial sense
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:22:31] e.g. i just read a friends proof of the following: "Suppose X,Y are topological spaces and Y is hausdorf. Let f,g:X->Y. Prove {x\in X: f(x)=g(x)} is closed"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:23:00] which i think would be very easy to prove using diagrams in category theory
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:23:11] that is if i knew how to represent closed/open subsets
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:24:23] (not that it's _necessarily_ that difficult using classical logic, i just think it'd be a fun exercise)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	tempate	[22:30:26] I'm guessing the open ball representation doesn't suit your needs?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:33:51] well that wouldn't make much sense, right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:33:55] how would you represent an open ball
2021-07-19 11:45:31	johnkeats6	[22:35:10] Y is hausdorff iff the diagonal is closed in YxY. your thing is the pullback of the diagonal under (f, g) : X --> Y x Y
2021-07-19 11:45:31	johnkeats6	[22:35:36] (f, g) is continuous, and so pre-image of a closed set is closed
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:37:11] wow
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pounce	[22:37:16] thank you :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	johnkeats6	[22:37:45] np, if i can get someone to not use category theory, it's an honest day's work
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dude12312414	[22:40:50] does it count if i never used it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pikapika	[22:46:46] how did people make angle instruments before jesse ramsden?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:37:41] Hey guys I just tried to integrate some function with sin and cos functions, using substitution method, but the result is not the same as WolframAlpha. could somebody help me look for a mistake in my initial part here? https://imgur.com/a/gQVFkHq
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:38:21] the later part of the integration I already verified to be fine, so I assume the mistake must be here
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:40:11] the final result I got was: -1/2 * cos(x)^2 + 1/2 * log(cos(x)^2+1)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:40:24] but the WolframAlpha result is: 1/4(2log(cos(2x)+3)-cos(2x))
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mouseghost	[23:40:56] isnt it that these can differ with c?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mouseghost	[23:40:58] idk
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:41:25] yea there is a C constant in the end of both results there
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:42:05] but there is no constant that makes the two results equivalent so it's a difference of more than a constant
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mouseghost	[23:42:47] ye nvm
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:43:25] anovick: it's right
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:44:14] qergle: thank you for checking!
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:44:16] integrating -y^3/(y^2+1) gives -y^2/2+ln(1+y^2)/2
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:44:32] and if you sub back in cos(x) for y, you get what you would expect.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:45:31] qergle: yep exactly what I calculated there too...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:45:44] so frustrating that WolframAlpha tells me I'm wrong :-(
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:46:21] as for W|A, check if cos(2x)=2cos^2(x)-1 makes it all work
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:46:34] ok one sec
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:47:17] (1/4)*-cos(2x) = (1/4)*(2*cos^2(x)-1) = 1/2*cos^2-1/4
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:47:36] oops, sign issue
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:47:51] (1/4)*-cos(2x) = (1/4)*(-2*cos^2(x)+1) = -1/2*cos^2+1/4
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:48:11] so now you've got a +1/4 that's off, see if you get from the other term
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mouseghost	[23:49:19] cant +1/4 be accounted in c tho?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mouseghost	[23:49:25] idk im not thinking
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:49:53] yes, if it's indefinite it can. anyways, work it all out
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:50:18] qergle: very well done!
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:50:30] I forgot about the cos(2x) identity with cos(x)^2
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:50:38] came in handy there
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:51:12] so I guess I wasn't wrong, and the two solutions are equivalent after all...! what a relief
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[23:51:39] the balance of the universe is restored
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:51:59] my faith in myself has also been restored :-)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:58:09] I have another question... if I integrate S(cos(x)dx) from 0 to pi/2 , and then substitute y = cos(x), is the new range for S(cos(x)dx) from cos(0)=1 to cos(pi/2)=0 ?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[23:58:31] I mean for S(ydy)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[00:01:32] new limits are 0 and 1
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meingtsla	[00:02:03] cos(x) dx does not simply become y dy, though
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[00:02:18] lower limit is 1 and upper limit is 0, in your case
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[00:02:31] meingtsla: yes you're right i'm sorry for providing a contrived example there
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[00:02:37] but y=cos(x) -> dy=sin(x)dx, so your sub is off
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:02:53] the eigenspace has per definition 1 degree of freedom, i.e. the spanning basis consists out of a vector in the eigenspace
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:02:55] right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[00:03:10] qergle: yes the substitution is off I'm aware
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[00:03:33] qergle: it is important which is the lower limit and which is the upper limit right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[00:04:02] if it was from 0 to pi/2, then it should be from 1 to 0 after substitution
2021-07-19 11:45:31	anovick	[00:04:26] if I calculate from 0 to 1 it would be the negative result
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[00:05:24] yes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:06:32] CuriousErnestBro: One eigenvalue can have a more than one-dimensional eigenspace.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:07:01] E.g. the identity transformation has eigenvalue 1, and the corresponding eigenspace is the whole space.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:07:24] PlanckWalk so rickyrick just told me you'd have to solve for ker(A - lambda I), idk why you'd do that
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:07:32] To find the eigensapce
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:07:50] to attempt to obtain the (hopefully) linearly independent eigenvectors
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:08:26] PlanckWalk yes, that is clear, but how does eigenspace come from A - lambda I?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:08:26] All the (nonzero) vectors in that kernel are eigenvectors for eigenvalue lambda
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:08:52] sure, that's what the theorems state
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:09:01] A v = lambda v  iff  A v = lambda I v  iff  (A - lambda I) v = 0
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:09:08] what is the logic behind it though?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:09:15] I.e. v is in the kernel of  A - lambda I
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:09:48] is the matrix -vector product distributive and commutative?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:10:03] yes. no.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:10:11] Distributive, yes, and is commutative for addition
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:10:19] (But not for multiplication)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:21] and subtraction
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:27] that's what you use here
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:10:31] No, I don't
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:10:35] suutraction is not commutative either
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:10:41] Nowhere do I use  A - B = B - A
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:51] oh
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:11:07] ok, you do use distributive though right
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:11:10] Yes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:11:26] (A - B) v = A v - B v
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:12:02] That comes from the transformation being linear.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:12:41] there's also this associativity-like property of multiplication by a scalar... lambda (I v) = (lambda I) v
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:12:49] Well, I suppose it's also the fact that the space of transformations is itself linear.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:13:08] I also remember something with a determinant in eigenvalue/vector stuff
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:13:36] Yes, you often use determinant (in principle) to find eigenvalues
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:13:36] ok so v ∈ Ker(A - λI) iff Av=λv
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:14:07] det(A - lambda I) != 0 would imply that Av = lambda v only for v = 0
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:14:22] while det(A - lambda I) = 0 ensures a non-empty kernel
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:14:33] so there are eigenvectors corresponding to lambda
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:14:47] that's the determinant connection
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:14:50] ahh
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:07] determinant measures the volume
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:08] that's why
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:46] det(A - λI) != 0 => empty nullspace of A-λI
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:58] because the matrix transformation preserves its volume
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:18:02] so I guess it's possible to have no eigenvalues?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:19:44] you always have complex eigenvalues but there can be no real eigenvalues
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:19:48] Well, if A is an nxn matrix then det(A - λI) is a polynomial of degree n in λ. If you're working over an algebraically complete field like the complex numbers, that gives you n eigenvalues (not necessarily distinct)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[00:19:49] [0 -1;1 0] has no evalues over R
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:20:24] so having an eigenvalue means that your linear transformation matrix A is kind of degenerate in the sense that the "range" can have less "degrees of freedom" than the domain
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[00:20:26] you can come up with many quadratics with no real roots, that was just a simple one
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:14] int-e idk what a "field" is
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:21] I guess it's not important
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:21:28] A - λI  is "degenerate", but A doesn't need to be
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:40] hmmm
2021-07-19 11:45:31	PlanckWalk	[00:21:42] A is "degenerate" if it has 0 as an eigenvalue
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:22:02] wait a second
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:22:09] degenerate means there's a nonzero vector v with Av = 0
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:22:14] equivalently it's not one to one
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:22:25] people consider that "degenerate" behavior
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:22:42] idk I just came up with the term "degenerate"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:22:53] heh well that's real terminology
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:20] I guess the real terminology would be non invertible
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:28] because you lose info you can't get back
2021-07-19 11:45:31	buster	[00:23:33] or singular
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:23:33] right
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:48] singular is a synonym for non invertible afaik
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[00:24:30] singular means odd or out-of-the-ordinary
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:24:45] in a nonmathematical setting, qergle
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:24:48] oh, I always found that term to be odd
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:24:50] (lol)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	qergle	[00:25:08] frelleck: yes, and i believe that's the mathematical etymology. det()=0 is rare.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:25:36] so a λ of 0 would mean there's an eigenspace that is the number 0
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:25:38] {0}
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:25:53] eigenvalue is zero
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:26:05] eigenspace is the span of one or more nonzero vectors
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:26:28] is the eigenspace defined on the domain or range?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	buster	[00:26:29] if anything, {0} is the eigenspace corresponding to all the non-eigenvalues
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mandanguita	[00:26:33] Hello, I want to show that if {(x_n, y_n)} is a sequence in the prehilbert space H1xH2 that converges to (x, y) in H1xH2, then {(x_b)} -> x in H1
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:27:23] buster if by non-eigenvalues you mean λ=0 then yes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mandanguita	[00:27:44] the solution it says that it is enought to see that ||x_n - x||_1 <= ||(x_n, y_n) - (x, y)||, but I don't know where this inequality comes from
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:23] Thank you all for teaching me
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:34] I will probably die before I know where det() comes from
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:28:44] mandanguita: how is ||.|| defined for H1xH2?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:44] it is enough to know it's a volume measurement
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:50] time to move on with my life :D
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mandanguita	[00:29:11] int-e: ||(x,y)|| = sqrt(||x||_1^2+||y||_2^2)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:29:34] mandanguita: so you're asking why ||x||_1 <= sqrt(||x||_1^2 + ||y||_2^2)?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mandanguita	[00:31:25] I see
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[00:33:22] hi
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[00:34:37] natural integers form a group under addition, right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[00:34:52] paulo_: what's the inverse operation?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[00:34:53] no
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[00:49:55] but they do form a monoid, if you include 0 in that set
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[00:55:09] if I include 0 and negative numbers?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[00:55:31] each element's inverse is it's negative
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[00:55:36] and the identify element is 0
2021-07-19 11:45:31	CuriousErnestBro	[00:56:55] most math books, like most math students, are mediocre
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:11:08] paulo_: if it has all positive and negative integers and 0, that is just "Z", or "the integers".  You wouldn't call that the "natural integers" because we have a term "natural numbers" to mean only the positive ones, or the non-negative ones, in an alternate meaning.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:11:20] but yes, Z with addition is a group
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:13:06] Simple exercise I read recently, that never seems to come anywhere (maybe it's too easy): Show that if A is an abelian group all of whose proper nonzero subgroups are =~ Z, then A =~ Z.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:13:34] (also, A is infinite so it does *have* some proper nonzero subgroups)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	alphamul2	[01:19:30] I'll make an extended hypothesis:  Like most real numbers are irrational, most possible books are nonsense.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	alphamul2	[01:19:35] :D
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:21:54] I can think of a Zorn's lemma proof Z-module
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:22:13] just order the proper subgroups by inclusion and choose a maximal subgroup
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:22:40] I should say proper subgroups along with the whole group
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:23:13] hm something along those lines
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:23:43] I dunno maybe I'm being dumb
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	frelleck [01:23:55] goes back to simple activities
2021-07-19 11:45:31	alphamul2	[01:24:22] For 0<x,1, no overlap of say 0.90 and 0.9:   2-digit numbers are 10 times as common as 1-digit numbers.  3-digit numbers are 10 times as common as 2-digit numbers.  And so on.  <---  Isn't ths this true?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	alphamul2	[01:24:41] Oh right
2021-07-19 11:45:31	alphamul2	[01:24:45] actually, 9x
2021-07-19 11:45:31	alphamul2	[01:24:51] Becuase 0 case, duh
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:27:05] Z-module: I'm missing something... how does that work for {x/p^n | x in Z, n in N}?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:28:42] oh, because we can restrict x to qZ for some q != p and get a subgroup.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:28:53] *proper* subgroup
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:29:33] (those p,q are supposed to be primes)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:31:03] frelleck: why is the union of a chain of proper subgroups a *proper* subgroup?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:31:16] that's why I tacked the whole group on
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:32:21] then it all became meaningless
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:35:21] Ah, okay. I was just wondering what a proper maximal proper subgroup of Q would look like, and afaics there is none.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:35:39] int-e, yeah (well, you should say q has some prime divisor other than p)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:35:57] right, divisible abelian groups don't have maximal subgroups
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:36:20] Z-module: I don't need to say that; all the other factors come from Z in qZ.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:37:57] if q is some p^m or some -p^m, your subgroup is actually the full group
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:38:49] But this means I'm done. I can consider {x+x | x in A} which is a proper subgroup of A unless every element of A is divisible by 2; in the latter case there's a subgroup isomorphic to {x/2^n | x in Z, n in N} and we've just seen that that has a *proper* subgroup not isomorphic to Z.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:39:19] Z-module: "(those p,q are supposed to be primes)"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:40:16] oh, missed that q was supposed to be
2021-07-19 11:45:31	alphamul2	[01:42:31] A nice way to generate a list:   Increment loop starting with 1, and then place the digit in the output as OPPOSITE place.  So, 0.1,0.2,...,0.9,0.01,0.11,0.21,...,0.02,and so on.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	alphamul2	[01:43:27] As a sort of canon order to describe said situation from earlier.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:43:52] dumb question if A + A is cyclic why is A cyclic?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:44:17] I should say {x + x: x in A}
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:44:42] that's not true
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:45:12] so that might be a proper subgroup of A which is cyclic, but A itself is not
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:45:27] Yes.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[01:45:44] so why are you done? :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:45:53] Good question.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	frelleck [01:47:41] slithers off
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:47:59] frelleck: Well {x+x | x in A} is isomorphic to A unless there's an element of order 2 in A.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:48:50] Because that map is injective otherwise: x+x = y+y implies 2(x-y) = 0.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:49:34] Anyhow, the proof someone else posted, that might be too hammer-using, is:  For all nonzero a in A, either <a> = A or <a> =~ Z  so a has infinite order. We can't have nA = A for all integers n > 1, since this would make A divisible, but all nonzero torsionfree divisible groups are vector spaces over Q so those have non-cyclic nonzero proper subgroups. So say mA is a proper subgroup of A, for some fixed m > 1.  The homomorphism  x |-> mx
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:49:34] has 0 kernel since A is torsionfree, so mA =~ Z.  But also mA =~ A because of that map I just menteioned. So A =~ Z.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:52:16] frelleck: I did actually consider that part. But yeah, I didn't mention it in my (pretty rough) sketch.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:53:28] apparently there do exist (as somewhat-cousins of Tarski Monsters) nonabelian infinite groups all of whose nonzero proper subgroups are =~ Z.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:53:47] eww
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:57:08] Z-module: unpacking that... it's not all that different from my proof, except I fixed m=2 so I didn't get all of Q when mA = A.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:57:14] "a Tarski monster for the prime aleph_0"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[01:57:22] s/proof/proof sketch/
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[01:57:32] yeah, yours is more parimonious
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[02:01:06] and I'm reminded now of the occasionally handy fact that every infinite group G (including non-ab) has at least |G| many distinct subgroups.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[02:02:10] ...all cyclic...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[02:02:39] I mean, you can restrict those subgroups to be cyclic. Unless I'm missing something again?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[02:03:38] that's right
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Fangs	[02:05:39] why is thathandy
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[02:07:21] when messing around the structural facts about infinite groups
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[02:07:29] i.e., "not often"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[02:09:07] Let g ~ g' iff <g> = <g'>, then all the equivalence classes are finite, so |G/~| = |G| (that's just equivalence classes, not a group quotient)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[02:09:43] And each equivalence class corresponds to a distinct cyclic subgroup of G.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	int-e	[02:10:12] (that's how the relation is constructed)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[02:10:36] oh wow, there are even uncountable nonabelian groups all of whose proper subgroups are countable.  (but abelian groups don't have this anomaly)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Z-module	[02:21:46] int-e, that ~ way is quite pretty. My unpretty way was:  If G is infinite, then either:  (i) G is countable, and (i.a) all its cyclic subgroups are finite so there have to be at least aleph_0 of those, or else (i.b) it has a subgroup =~ Z which itself has aleph_0 distinct subroups;    or    (ii) G is uncountable in which case there must be |G| many distinct cyclic subgroups since those are all countable.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Fangs	[02:22:05] are you guys working on a problem?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Fangs	[02:23:20] Z-module: I think you can say a lot of stuff about profinite groups, so I wouldn't count 'structural facts abotu infinite groups' as inherently something that doesn't come up often
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[02:50:45] > Warning. Intuition is usually OK for finite measures, and adapts well for sigma-finite measures. However, measures which are not sigma-finite can be crazy; fortunately, there are no such measures in this book.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[02:51:02] Do non-sigma-finite measures come up often in other fields like real analysis or something?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Galois	[02:59:24] the usual example of a non-sigma-finite measure is: you want to assign probabilities to a countable set of events, such that any single event has probability 0, but the entire set has probability 1.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Galois	[02:59:43] for example, "pick a random rational number in the interval [0,1]"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Galois	[03:00:09] for what should be obvious reasons, there does not exist any sigma-finite measure satisfying the stated properties
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:02:43] i think im missing the obvious reasons; wouldn't [0,1] be a countable union of intervals with finite length?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:03:30] i guess i cant really think about that, i don't exactly know what lebesgue measure is, even though i think im invoking it by talking about length
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Galois	[03:03:43] oh, sorry, I messed up. The problem is that this isn't a measure, not that it isn't a sigma-finite measure
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[03:04:50] just use the discrete measure on an uncountable set
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[03:05:02] I don't know how natural that is but it's an easy example
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:05:15] i think i might be asking this question prematurely; maybe i should get comfortable with different examples of measures before thinking about it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Galois	[03:06:33] you can also take the borel/lebesgue measure on the long line
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:06:58] its kind of cool that any countably additive function on an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the sigma algebra generated by that algebra; that seems like a strong statement to make
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:07:18] i cant wait for the appendix to hit me with a 5 page proof
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[03:07:30] it's pretty icky iirc
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[03:07:33] uses outer measures
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:08:45] it is in fact a 5 page proof
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:08:50] and does in fact use outer measures
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frelleck	[03:09:43] short but icky I guess
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:10:10] i guess short depends on how many assumptions you take for granted or include as part of the proof heh
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:10:15] lemmas, i mean
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:11:13] cauchy's integral theorem is trivial if you just use green's theorem :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mefistofeles	[03:11:48] green's theorem tastes better with a bagel, btw
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:11:54] ;)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:12:18] this does make me want to learn some measure theory before going further, since it seems like there's a lot of development im taking for granted
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:12:24] probably a rabbit hole though, ill come back to it later lol
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:17:33] WOAH
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:17:51] i remember my analysis text giving a first glance at the cosntruction of lebesgue measure
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:18:21] but this book just hits you with the "it's the unique measure obtained by extending the countably additive "length" function on unions of intervals"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:18:24] woaaaaah
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Galois	[03:19:23] I think that theorem is at https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/measure_theory/outer_measure.lean#L961
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Galois	[03:20:14] and yes, lean uses what you just said: def lebesgue_outer : outer_measure ℝ := outer_measure.of_function lebesgue_length lebesgue_length_empty
2021-07-19 11:45:31	greenbagels	[03:20:59] yeah my text calls it caratheodory's extension theorem

2021-07-19 14:39:05	qergle	if the sum is ≤ n it's not a padding issue at all. what's happened is you've not counted all the "kinds".

2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[15:55:36] weird
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[15:58:51] mouseghost that's graph theory 101
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[15:59:00] euler cycle I think
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[15:59:12] eulerian
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[16:01:29] qedders, ye but like, idk why the book author decided to say "now we equipped to solve that" just after introducing a generalization for max edges in k-component graphs
2021-07-19 18:40:02	buster	[16:02:02] hi mouseghost. there are more bridges in kaliningrad now than there were then. which theorem?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[16:02:02] well time to read the rest of the book
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[16:02:14] wait konigsberg is kaliningrad?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[16:02:14] you can read it in a walk through combinatorics, I like that book
2021-07-19 18:40:02	buster	[16:02:21] yep
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[16:02:22] or in the douglas west book
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[16:02:29] introdcuction to graph theory
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[16:02:40] hmm i was looking at, lemme see the title

2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[16:04:05] but okie, ill look at the books by authors with more pronouncable names
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[16:04:05] The most difficult thing with the Konigsberg bridges for me was figuring out whether the author was joking or not
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[16:04:16] I solved a 10 year old problem of douglas west a few months ago, it will be online in the elecronic journal of combinatorics in 2-3 weeks
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[16:04:26] wo nice
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[16:04:34] It was 1736, about the same time Euler could do pentagonal theorem
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[16:04:55] The disparity between technical levels of that and of 7 bridges is so huge
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[16:05:39] I always though it's some hoax, and nobody ever considered the bridges above kids level
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[16:05:53] buster, are these bridges in the same place, though? or in some other parts of the city?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	|smlckz|	[16:06:15] qedders: which problem?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	buster	[16:06:24] i don't know, i'd have to check. google earth?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qedders	[16:07:47] |smlckz| the main conjecture in https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v16i1r7
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[16:08:16] now i want a postcard from there lol
2021-07-19 18:40:02	buster	[16:08:45] mouseghost, as far as I remember, the problem is even less interesting today
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[16:08:58] yeah so apparently the more pronouncable name, though not quite, author, actually made it without confusing me; thanks a lot
2021-07-19 18:40:02	buster	[16:09:13] great :)

2021-07-19 18:40:02	RedNifre	[19:19:16] Is there a trick for easily relating week number (first Thursday of the year is week 1) to the regular month and day of the month format?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	RedNifre	[19:21:22] It seems unlikely, given that 7 is prime and month have weird lengths, huh?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mornfall	[19:28:22] RedNifre: in your head or using a computer?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	RedNifre	[19:34:13] In my head.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mornfall	[19:35:12] seems unlikely (calendars usually have week numbers in them tho)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	RedNifre	[19:35:44] Hm... let's simplify it to just knowing the month... then you have 12 weeks that move between months. There are 7 different starts of the week, adding leap years makes 14 different weeks... learning 162 bits of look up table seems not feasible.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	RedNifre	[19:36:40] Well, leap years don't matter that much, you would just use a different table for mid february to the end of the year, so 84 bits to remember?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	RedNifre	[19:37:12] Maybe it's easier to create a custom watch face for the smart watch that displays the week number :/
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[19:37:14] RedNifre, doomsday algorithm maybe
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pikapika	[19:48:38] RedNifre, do you have a sidereal clock?

2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[19:59:02] argh i hate calendars

2021-07-19 18:40:02	mornfall	[19:59:35] who doesn't
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mornfall	[19:59:42] it's hard to come up with something more convoluted
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[20:00:06] leap seconds :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[20:00:35] they literally can't even be predicted, they are just agreed upon by a comittee from measuring the actual length of each earth day
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[20:03:00] :_:
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mornfall	[20:03:20] i don't think anybody who was around when timekeeping and calendars were being settled had any inkling that rotation of Earth randomly deviates by tiny fractions of a second from revolution to revolution
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[20:03:26] RedNifre: it's messy, but haven't we done this before?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[20:04:53] we haven't had a leap second since 2016, so should get some soon
2021-07-19 18:40:02	RedNifre	[20:06:02] int-e: Huh?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	RedNifre	[20:07:10] Well, I think the doomsday algorithm could work, if you remembered 7 different lookup tables with 12 entries each, telling you which of the month-edge weeks fall into which month.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mornfall	[20:07:21] riv: time to strap some rockets to the equator so that we can have an anti-leap second
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[20:08:52] RedNifre: Maybe it was a different person with the same kind of problem. It happens.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[20:08:53] hahaha
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[20:08:57] that sa great way to solve the problem
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[20:12:40] Which way?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[20:41:02] is the pair (S,Sigma) (where Sigma is a sigma-algebra on S) called a measurable space because a measure can always be shown to exist given those two objects?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[20:41:57] i vaguely recall something called the counting measure; isn't that a measure that works for any measurable space?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[20:43:37] ah, it is
2021-07-19 18:40:02	blackfield	[21:09:54] from Bruckner: one often uses the terminology "(X,M) is a measurable space" to suggest the possibility that there are many measures nu that make (X,M,nu) into a measure space (albeit the terminology in other languages might not reflect this nuance i'm afraid)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[21:10:46] that makes sense
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[21:11:10] i think a measure theory book probably hits the nuances right, this is just the "tl;dr:" definitions from a probability text
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[21:17:49] what is the categorical intuition behind closed sets
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[21:23:36] or i suppose, more generally: open/closed maps
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[21:24:49] what's an open map?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[21:25:03] nvm found wiki page on it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	loopspace	[21:25:05] Coequalizers maybe have some connection
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[21:52:25] i was thinking of it in terms of a topos, with object classifiers and maps to the spirspenski space
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[21:52:46] Sierpiński*
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[21:53:17] because one of the main characteristics of an open subset is that its charasteristic map to the Sierpiński space is continuous, right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[21:55:52] wow !! why did nobody tell me this before
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[21:55:56] that's really interesting
2021-07-19 18:40:02	johnkeats6	[22:08:40] i like to think of open sets as 'if you take a point and nudge it a little you're still in the set'
2021-07-19 18:40:02	johnkeats6	[22:08:48] but you do you :p
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:21:46] johnkeats6: yeah but this is response to my earlier question of thinking about open subsets in a categorial sense
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:22:31] e.g. i just read a friends proof of the following: "Suppose X,Y are topological spaces and Y is hausdorf. Let f,g:X->Y. Prove {x\in X: f(x)=g(x)} is closed"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:23:00] which i think would be very easy to prove using diagrams in category theory
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:23:11] that is if i knew how to represent closed/open subsets
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:24:23] (not that it's _necessarily_ that difficult using classical logic, i just think it'd be a fun exercise)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	tempate	[22:30:26] I'm guessing the open ball representation doesn't suit your needs?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:33:51] well that wouldn't make much sense, right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:33:55] how would you represent an open ball
2021-07-19 18:40:02	johnkeats6	[22:35:10] Y is hausdorff iff the diagonal is closed in YxY. your thing is the pullback of the diagonal under (f, g) : X --> Y x Y
2021-07-19 18:40:02	johnkeats6	[22:35:36] (f, g) is continuous, and so pre-image of a closed set is closed
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:37:11] wow
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pounce	[22:37:16] thank you :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	johnkeats6	[22:37:45] np, if i can get someone to not use category theory, it's an honest day's work
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dude12312414	[22:40:50] does it count if i never used it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pikapika	[22:46:46] how did people make angle instruments before jesse ramsden?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:37:41] Hey guys I just tried to integrate some function with sin and cos functions, using substitution method, but the result is not the same as WolframAlpha. could somebody help me look for a mistake in my initial part here? https://imgur.com/a/gQVFkHq
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:38:21] the later part of the integration I already verified to be fine, so I assume the mistake must be here
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:40:11] the final result I got was: -1/2 * cos(x)^2 + 1/2 * log(cos(x)^2+1)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:40:24] but the WolframAlpha result is: 1/4(2log(cos(2x)+3)-cos(2x))
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[23:40:56] isnt it that these can differ with c?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[23:40:58] idk
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:41:25] yea there is a C constant in the end of both results there
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:42:05] but there is no constant that makes the two results equivalent so it's a difference of more than a constant
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[23:42:47] ye nvm
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:43:25] anovick: it's right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:44:14] qergle: thank you for checking!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:44:16] integrating -y^3/(y^2+1) gives -y^2/2+ln(1+y^2)/2
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:44:32] and if you sub back in cos(x) for y, you get what you would expect.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:45:31] qergle: yep exactly what I calculated there too...
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:45:44] so frustrating that WolframAlpha tells me I'm wrong :-(
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:46:21] as for W|A, check if cos(2x)=2cos^2(x)-1 makes it all work
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:46:34] ok one sec
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:47:17] (1/4)*-cos(2x) = (1/4)*(2*cos^2(x)-1) = 1/2*cos^2-1/4
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:47:36] oops, sign issue
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:47:51] (1/4)*-cos(2x) = (1/4)*(-2*cos^2(x)+1) = -1/2*cos^2+1/4
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:48:11] so now you've got a +1/4 that's off, see if you get from the other term
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[23:49:19] cant +1/4 be accounted in c tho?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mouseghost	[23:49:25] idk im not thinking
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:49:53] yes, if it's indefinite it can. anyways, work it all out
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:50:18] qergle: very well done!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:50:30] I forgot about the cos(2x) identity with cos(x)^2
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:50:38] came in handy there
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:51:12] so I guess I wasn't wrong, and the two solutions are equivalent after all...! what a relief
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[23:51:39] the balance of the universe is restored
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:51:59] my faith in myself has also been restored :-)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:58:09] I have another question... if I integrate S(cos(x)dx) from 0 to pi/2 , and then substitute y = cos(x), is the new range for S(cos(x)dx) from cos(0)=1 to cos(pi/2)=0 ?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[23:58:31] I mean for S(ydy)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[00:01:32] new limits are 0 and 1
2021-07-19 18:40:02	meingtsla	[00:02:03] cos(x) dx does not simply become y dy, though
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[00:02:18] lower limit is 1 and upper limit is 0, in your case
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[00:02:31] meingtsla: yes you're right i'm sorry for providing a contrived example there
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[00:02:37] but y=cos(x) -> dy=sin(x)dx, so your sub is off
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:02:53] the eigenspace has per definition 1 degree of freedom, i.e. the spanning basis consists out of a vector in the eigenspace
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:02:55] right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[00:03:10] qergle: yes the substitution is off I'm aware
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[00:03:33] qergle: it is important which is the lower limit and which is the upper limit right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[00:04:02] if it was from 0 to pi/2, then it should be from 1 to 0 after substitution
2021-07-19 18:40:02	anovick	[00:04:26] if I calculate from 0 to 1 it would be the negative result
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[00:05:24] yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:06:32] CuriousErnestBro: One eigenvalue can have a more than one-dimensional eigenspace.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:07:01] E.g. the identity transformation has eigenvalue 1, and the corresponding eigenspace is the whole space.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:07:24] PlanckWalk so rickyrick just told me you'd have to solve for ker(A - lambda I), idk why you'd do that
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:07:32] To find the eigensapce
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:07:50] to attempt to obtain the (hopefully) linearly independent eigenvectors
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:08:26] PlanckWalk yes, that is clear, but how does eigenspace come from A - lambda I?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:08:26] All the (nonzero) vectors in that kernel are eigenvectors for eigenvalue lambda
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:08:52] sure, that's what the theorems state
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:09:01] A v = lambda v  iff  A v = lambda I v  iff  (A - lambda I) v = 0
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:09:08] what is the logic behind it though?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:09:15] I.e. v is in the kernel of  A - lambda I
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:09:48] is the matrix -vector product distributive and commutative?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:10:03] yes. no.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:10:11] Distributive, yes, and is commutative for addition
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:10:19] (But not for multiplication)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:21] and subtraction
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:27] that's what you use here
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:10:31] No, I don't
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:10:35] suutraction is not commutative either
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:10:41] Nowhere do I use  A - B = B - A
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:10:51] oh
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:11:07] ok, you do use distributive though right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:11:10] Yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:11:26] (A - B) v = A v - B v
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:12:02] That comes from the transformation being linear.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:12:41] there's also this associativity-like property of multiplication by a scalar... lambda (I v) = (lambda I) v
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:12:49] Well, I suppose it's also the fact that the space of transformations is itself linear.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:13:08] I also remember something with a determinant in eigenvalue/vector stuff
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:13:36] Yes, you often use determinant (in principle) to find eigenvalues
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:13:36] ok so v ∈ Ker(A - λI) iff Av=λv
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:14:07] det(A - lambda I) != 0 would imply that Av = lambda v only for v = 0
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:14:22] while det(A - lambda I) = 0 ensures a non-empty kernel
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:14:33] so there are eigenvectors corresponding to lambda
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:14:47] that's the determinant connection
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:14:50] ahh
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:07] determinant measures the volume
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:08] that's why
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:46] det(A - λI) != 0 => empty nullspace of A-λI
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:15:58] because the matrix transformation preserves its volume
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:18:02] so I guess it's possible to have no eigenvalues?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:19:44] you always have complex eigenvalues but there can be no real eigenvalues
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:19:48] Well, if A is an nxn matrix then det(A - λI) is a polynomial of degree n in λ. If you're working over an algebraically complete field like the complex numbers, that gives you n eigenvalues (not necessarily distinct)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[00:19:49] [0 -1;1 0] has no evalues over R
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:20:24] so having an eigenvalue means that your linear transformation matrix A is kind of degenerate in the sense that the "range" can have less "degrees of freedom" than the domain
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[00:20:26] you can come up with many quadratics with no real roots, that was just a simple one
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:14] int-e idk what a "field" is
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:21] I guess it's not important
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:21:28] A - λI  is "degenerate", but A doesn't need to be
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:21:40] hmmm
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[00:21:42] A is "degenerate" if it has 0 as an eigenvalue
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:22:02] wait a second
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:22:09] degenerate means there's a nonzero vector v with Av = 0
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:22:14] equivalently it's not one to one
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:22:25] people consider that "degenerate" behavior
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:22:42] idk I just came up with the term "degenerate"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:22:53] heh well that's real terminology
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:20] I guess the real terminology would be non invertible
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:28] because you lose info you can't get back
2021-07-19 18:40:02	buster	[00:23:33] or singular
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:23:33] right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:23:48] singular is a synonym for non invertible afaik
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[00:24:30] singular means odd or out-of-the-ordinary
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:24:45] in a nonmathematical setting, qergle
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:24:48] oh, I always found that term to be odd
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:24:50] (lol)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[00:25:08] frelleck: yes, and i believe that's the mathematical etymology. det()=0 is rare.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:25:36] so a λ of 0 would mean there's an eigenspace that is the number 0
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:25:38] {0}
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:25:53] eigenvalue is zero
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:26:05] eigenspace is the span of one or more nonzero vectors
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:26:28] is the eigenspace defined on the domain or range?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	buster	[00:26:29] if anything, {0} is the eigenspace corresponding to all the non-eigenvalues
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mandanguita	[00:26:33] Hello, I want to show that if {(x_n, y_n)} is a sequence in the prehilbert space H1xH2 that converges to (x, y) in H1xH2, then {(x_b)} -> x in H1
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:27:23] buster if by non-eigenvalues you mean λ=0 then yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mandanguita	[00:27:44] the solution it says that it is enought to see that ||x_n - x||_1 <= ||(x_n, y_n) - (x, y)||, but I don't know where this inequality comes from
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:23] Thank you all for teaching me
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:34] I will probably die before I know where det() comes from
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:28:44] mandanguita: how is ||.|| defined for H1xH2?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:44] it is enough to know it's a volume measurement
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:28:50] time to move on with my life :D
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mandanguita	[00:29:11] int-e: ||(x,y)|| = sqrt(||x||_1^2+||y||_2^2)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:29:34] mandanguita: so you're asking why ||x||_1 <= sqrt(||x||_1^2 + ||y||_2^2)?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mandanguita	[00:31:25] I see
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[00:33:22] hi
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[00:34:37] natural integers form a group under addition, right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[00:34:52] paulo_: what's the inverse operation?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[00:34:53] no
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[00:49:55] but they do form a monoid, if you include 0 in that set
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[00:55:09] if I include 0 and negative numbers?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[00:55:31] each element's inverse is it's negative
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[00:55:36] and the identify element is 0
2021-07-19 18:40:02	CuriousErnestBro	[00:56:55] most math books, like most math students, are mediocre
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:11:08] paulo_: if it has all positive and negative integers and 0, that is just "Z", or "the integers".  You wouldn't call that the "natural integers" because we have a term "natural numbers" to mean only the positive ones, or the non-negative ones, in an alternate meaning.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:11:20] but yes, Z with addition is a group
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:13:06] Simple exercise I read recently, that never seems to come anywhere (maybe it's too easy): Show that if A is an abelian group all of whose proper nonzero subgroups are =~ Z, then A =~ Z.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:13:34] (also, A is infinite so it does *have* some proper nonzero subgroups)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[01:19:30] I'll make an extended hypothesis:  Like most real numbers are irrational, most possible books are nonsense.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[01:19:35] :D
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:21:54] I can think of a Zorn's lemma proof Z-module
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:22:13] just order the proper subgroups by inclusion and choose a maximal subgroup
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:22:40] I should say proper subgroups along with the whole group
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:23:13] hm something along those lines
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:23:43] I dunno maybe I'm being dumb
2021-07-19 18:40:02	 *	frelleck [01:23:55] goes back to simple activities
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[01:24:22] For 0<x,1, no overlap of say 0.90 and 0.9:   2-digit numbers are 10 times as common as 1-digit numbers.  3-digit numbers are 10 times as common as 2-digit numbers.  And so on.  <---  Isn't ths this true?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[01:24:41] Oh right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[01:24:45] actually, 9x
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[01:24:51] Becuase 0 case, duh
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:27:05] Z-module: I'm missing something... how does that work for {x/p^n | x in Z, n in N}?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:28:42] oh, because we can restrict x to qZ for some q != p and get a subgroup.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:28:53] *proper* subgroup
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:29:33] (those p,q are supposed to be primes)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:31:03] frelleck: why is the union of a chain of proper subgroups a *proper* subgroup?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:31:16] that's why I tacked the whole group on
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:32:21] then it all became meaningless
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:35:21] Ah, okay. I was just wondering what a proper maximal proper subgroup of Q would look like, and afaics there is none.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:35:39] int-e, yeah (well, you should say q has some prime divisor other than p)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:35:57] right, divisible abelian groups don't have maximal subgroups
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:36:20] Z-module: I don't need to say that; all the other factors come from Z in qZ.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:37:57] if q is some p^m or some -p^m, your subgroup is actually the full group
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:38:49] But this means I'm done. I can consider {x+x | x in A} which is a proper subgroup of A unless every element of A is divisible by 2; in the latter case there's a subgroup isomorphic to {x/2^n | x in Z, n in N} and we've just seen that that has a *proper* subgroup not isomorphic to Z.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:39:19] Z-module: "(those p,q are supposed to be primes)"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:40:16] oh, missed that q was supposed to be
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[01:42:31] A nice way to generate a list:   Increment loop starting with 1, and then place the digit in the output as OPPOSITE place.  So, 0.1,0.2,...,0.9,0.01,0.11,0.21,...,0.02,and so on.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[01:43:27] As a sort of canon order to describe said situation from earlier.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:43:52] dumb question if A + A is cyclic why is A cyclic?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:44:17] I should say {x + x: x in A}
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:44:42] that's not true
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:45:12] so that might be a proper subgroup of A which is cyclic, but A itself is not
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:45:27] Yes.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[01:45:44] so why are you done? :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:45:53] Good question.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	 *	frelleck [01:47:41] slithers off
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:47:59] frelleck: Well {x+x | x in A} is isomorphic to A unless there's an element of order 2 in A.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:48:50] Because that map is injective otherwise: x+x = y+y implies 2(x-y) = 0.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:49:34] Anyhow, the proof someone else posted, that might be too hammer-using, is:  For all nonzero a in A, either <a> = A or <a> =~ Z  so a has infinite order. We can't have nA = A for all integers n > 1, since this would make A divisible, but all nonzero torsionfree divisible groups are vector spaces over Q so those have non-cyclic nonzero proper subgroups. So say mA is a proper subgroup of A, for some fixed m > 1.  The homomorphism  x |-> mx
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:49:34] has 0 kernel since A is torsionfree, so mA =~ Z.  But also mA =~ A because of that map I just menteioned. So A =~ Z.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:52:16] frelleck: I did actually consider that part. But yeah, I didn't mention it in my (pretty rough) sketch.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:53:28] apparently there do exist (as somewhat-cousins of Tarski Monsters) nonabelian infinite groups all of whose nonzero proper subgroups are =~ Z.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:53:47] eww
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:57:08] Z-module: unpacking that... it's not all that different from my proof, except I fixed m=2 so I didn't get all of Q when mA = A.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:57:14] "a Tarski monster for the prime aleph_0"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[01:57:22] s/proof/proof sketch/
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[01:57:32] yeah, yours is more parimonious
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[02:01:06] and I'm reminded now of the occasionally handy fact that every infinite group G (including non-ab) has at least |G| many distinct subgroups.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[02:02:10] ...all cyclic...
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[02:02:39] I mean, you can restrict those subgroups to be cyclic. Unless I'm missing something again?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[02:03:38] that's right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Fangs	[02:05:39] why is thathandy
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[02:07:21] when messing around the structural facts about infinite groups
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[02:07:29] i.e., "not often"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[02:09:07] Let g ~ g' iff <g> = <g'>, then all the equivalence classes are finite, so |G/~| = |G| (that's just equivalence classes, not a group quotient)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[02:09:43] And each equivalence class corresponds to a distinct cyclic subgroup of G.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[02:10:12] (that's how the relation is constructed)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[02:10:36] oh wow, there are even uncountable nonabelian groups all of whose proper subgroups are countable.  (but abelian groups don't have this anomaly)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Z-module	[02:21:46] int-e, that ~ way is quite pretty. My unpretty way was:  If G is infinite, then either:  (i) G is countable, and (i.a) all its cyclic subgroups are finite so there have to be at least aleph_0 of those, or else (i.b) it has a subgroup =~ Z which itself has aleph_0 distinct subroups;    or    (ii) G is uncountable in which case there must be |G| many distinct cyclic subgroups since those are all countable.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Fangs	[02:22:05] are you guys working on a problem?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Fangs	[02:23:20] Z-module: I think you can say a lot of stuff about profinite groups, so I wouldn't count 'structural facts abotu infinite groups' as inherently something that doesn't come up often
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[02:50:45] > Warning. Intuition is usually OK for finite measures, and adapts well for sigma-finite measures. However, measures which are not sigma-finite can be crazy; fortunately, there are no such measures in this book.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[02:51:02] Do non-sigma-finite measures come up often in other fields like real analysis or something?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Galois	[02:59:24] the usual example of a non-sigma-finite measure is: you want to assign probabilities to a countable set of events, such that any single event has probability 0, but the entire set has probability 1.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Galois	[02:59:43] for example, "pick a random rational number in the interval [0,1]"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Galois	[03:00:09] for what should be obvious reasons, there does not exist any sigma-finite measure satisfying the stated properties
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:02:43] i think im missing the obvious reasons; wouldn't [0,1] be a countable union of intervals with finite length?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:03:30] i guess i cant really think about that, i don't exactly know what lebesgue measure is, even though i think im invoking it by talking about length
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Galois	[03:03:43] oh, sorry, I messed up. The problem is that this isn't a measure, not that it isn't a sigma-finite measure
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[03:04:50] just use the discrete measure on an uncountable set
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[03:05:02] I don't know how natural that is but it's an easy example
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:05:15] i think i might be asking this question prematurely; maybe i should get comfortable with different examples of measures before thinking about it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Galois	[03:06:33] you can also take the borel/lebesgue measure on the long line
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:06:58] its kind of cool that any countably additive function on an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the sigma algebra generated by that algebra; that seems like a strong statement to make
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:07:18] i cant wait for the appendix to hit me with a 5 page proof
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[03:07:30] it's pretty icky iirc
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[03:07:33] uses outer measures
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:08:45] it is in fact a 5 page proof
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:08:50] and does in fact use outer measures
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frelleck	[03:09:43] short but icky I guess
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:10:10] i guess short depends on how many assumptions you take for granted or include as part of the proof heh
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:10:15] lemmas, i mean
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:11:13] cauchy's integral theorem is trivial if you just use green's theorem :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mefistofeles	[03:11:48] green's theorem tastes better with a bagel, btw
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:11:54] ;)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:12:18] this does make me want to learn some measure theory before going further, since it seems like there's a lot of development im taking for granted
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:12:24] probably a rabbit hole though, ill come back to it later lol
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:17:33] WOAH
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:17:51] i remember my analysis text giving a first glance at the cosntruction of lebesgue measure
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:18:21] but this book just hits you with the "it's the unique measure obtained by extending the countably additive "length" function on unions of intervals"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:18:24] woaaaaah
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Galois	[03:19:23] I think that theorem is at https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/measure_theory/outer_measure.lean#L961
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Galois	[03:20:14] and yes, lean uses what you just said: def lebesgue_outer : outer_measure ℝ := outer_measure.of_function lebesgue_length lebesgue_length_empty
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:20:59] yeah my text calls it caratheodory's extension theorem
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[03:21:16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem
2021-07-19 18:40:02	darwin	[05:01:48] who was the guy who recited pi for 80 days?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	darwin	[05:48:33] i saw a UK billboard sign "Football: It's Our Religion" (football in most the world, but in USA a.k.a. soccer) so I want to see a billboard sign with people in ancient/Classical Greek clothes "Mathematics: It's Our Religion"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[06:14:38] people in antiquity used to sometimes kill each other over math disputes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	astronaut	[06:22:02] pascal lost an eye in a math dispute
2021-07-19 18:40:02	astronaut	[06:22:08] or was it cardano?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[06:34:58] i dont think it was pascal
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[06:55:09] there are uncountably many strictly increasing maps from N to N, right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[06:56:01] since, given such a function f, for any n in the domain of f, there are countably many choices for f, even when considering the increasing constraint
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[06:56:59] yeah that's obvious; man i feel so rusty already
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lieven	[07:00:14] one way of easily seeing this is noting that each such function is uniquely described by its increment at each point of N
2021-07-19 18:40:02	greenbagels	[07:01:46] that's a nice way of looking at it, yeah
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lieven	[07:02:35] well, its increments and its starting value of course
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[07:03:43] huh, x^2+x+1 | x^4n - x^n
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[07:03:45] thats crazy
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[07:03:59] There are even uncountably many that just increase by 1 or 2 at each step.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	PlanckWalk	[07:05:58] (x-1)(x^2+x+1) = x^3 - 1, x^(4n) - x^n = x^n (x^(3n) - 1), and x^3-1 divides x^(3n) - 1.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	riv	[07:06:10] nice!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[07:13:24] Hmm, wasn't there a school that got burned down because they wouldn't let this one guy go to it, that then spread the teachings across the continent because of fleeing students?  XD
2021-07-19 18:40:02	alphamul2	[07:13:48] Man, that was Greece, wasn't it?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[08:20:16] how do I prove that x^2 - y^3 = 1 has no integer solutions?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[08:26:10] that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[08:27:24] anyways x=3, y=2 solves. you probably mean no other than that.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[08:32:21] what about the special case: y can't be odd
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[08:32:47] x=3,y=2 is the only solution
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[08:33:07] yeah, I'm trying to prove that y can't be odd
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[08:35:56] x^2 - 1 = y^3 <=> (x+1)(x-1) = y^3
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[08:40:17] assuming y is odd, then x+1 and x-1 are consecutive odd numbers. so x+1 and x-1 are coprime
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[08:40:45] this also implies that x+1 and x-1 are cubes. but this is impossible since there are not 2-apart cubes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[08:40:54] "that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time" -- what?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[08:41:07] Mixing with 3^x-2^y=1?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[08:41:35] we arrive at a contradiction, so y can't be odd
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[08:41:40] is my proof correct?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[08:53:11] n!/n1!*n2!*..*nk!    gives me the total permutations of a set of n objects, with k "kinds" of these objects, right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[08:54:51] yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[08:55:02] rendar ^
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[08:55:25] now my question is:
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[08:55:33] n1+n2+...+nk must be = n ?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[08:55:39] yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[08:55:55] otherwise if it's different than n, what am i getting?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[08:56:10] nᵢ is the number of objects of type i. the sum over the types must be the total amount.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[08:56:55] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem#Number_of_unique_permutations_of_words
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:02:23] yeah
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:02:49] but if i specify a number different than n, i'm not getting permutations, but some other result.. not related to permutations i guess
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[09:05:55] Possibly not even integer, so not necessarily combinatorially interpretable
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[09:07:35] If the sum is <=n, you can assume it's padded with 1!1!..1! though
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cherim__	[09:07:51] With a clear combinatorial meaning
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:09:05] if the sum is ≤ n it's not a padding issue at all. what's happened is you've not counted all the "kinds".
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:09:24] or it's a mispecified problem
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:09:37] at that point it's no longer math but sorcery to determine what is happening.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:14:40] qergle: but if i have a set of 10 objects, 7 of a kind, 1 of a kind, 1 of a kind and 1 of a kind, i'll get: 10!/7!1!1!1! = 10!/7!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:14:42] right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:15:00] yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:15:21] so it's not math sorcery, it's a real thing
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:15:34] it's not
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:15:39] this still holds: <rendar> n1+n2+...+nk must be = n
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:15:44] 7+1+1+1=10
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:15:53] yeah
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:16:07] ok bbl.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:16:14] so cherim__ was right that if we have <n we can consider that with padding 1!1!1!..!1
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:16:29] if what is <n?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:17:11] n1+n2+...+nk < n
2021-07-19 18:40:02	qergle	[09:17:18] you don't have that
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:17:53] ok
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:39:15] if i have 10 sports game and 5 arcade games, if i pick 5 games, how many ways are there that i get 3 arcade games and 2 sports game? nCr(10,3)*nCr(5,2) = 120*10 = 1200
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:39:20] this is correct, right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:40:38] i can't get why the book uses nCr operation 2 times
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[09:44:55] rendar: C(10,3) * C(5,2) is correct, but what is the question?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:45:28] int-e: my calculator calls that C() operation nCr
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[09:45:40] that's fine, I'm too lazy to type that
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[09:46:02] and I don't like the look of 10C3 * 5C2 (which is the notation that that nCr derives from)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:46:50] right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:47:05] int-e: my question is: why i have to use C() 2 times?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[09:47:43] rendar: Because you're selecting 3 aracde games (that's one C) and 2 sports games (that's the other one)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:48:35] sorry, i misread the excersise!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[09:48:43] yeah, it's clear now
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:51:07] Hi all, a question
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:51:56] I want to understand better how to determine whether an assumption in a set of assumptions is REQUIRED for a proof or is superfluous to the probelm at hand
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:52:25] e.g.  x = 5 & y = 6 & z = 7, therefore x + y = 11 (z is completely unrelated)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:52:40] But not just for this simple example, but more generally to all proofs
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:52:50] Can anybody point me in the right direction?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lieven	[09:55:16] you can try to find counterexamples to theorems if you leave out one of the assumptions
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[09:55:51] lisp123: well, an assumption is superfluous if there's a proof not using the assumption. so identifying required assumptions seems more useful, and you can do that by finding counterexamples to the theorem without the assumption in question
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[09:56:32] (note that required assumptions may still be stronger than necessary)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lieven	[09:57:11] in a more advanced way there's the field of reverse mathematics that works out to what extent theorems have equivalent logical power to their assumptions. Stillwell wrote a fairly accessible account on it.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:58:12] thanks int-e & lieven
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:58:53] I'm trying to find a way of identifying superfluous conditions without prior knowledge of the required assumptions
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:59:14] lieven: thanks for this reverse mathematics lead, I will look into Stillwell now
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[09:59:58] One thing I was thinking, was that if the result of a theorem is expressed in certain variables, e.g. x & y, then checking all the input assumptions - one could disregard any assumption that has no relation AT ALL to the variables used in the result?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[10:00:52] heh, even if a theorem is equivalent to its assumptions, the assumptions may be redundant.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[10:02:16] int-e: thanks, i agree. However would my approach at least strip out some basic assumptions (i.e. some but not all), or would you know if it could be flawed in the sense that some assumptions are incorrectly kicked out?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	int-e	[10:02:20] s/a theorem/a theorem's conclusion/
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Fangs	[10:13:00] lieven: if your assumption is never used in the proof, then it is superfluous (to the proof, and hence the result)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Fangs	[10:13:06] oh they left
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Fangs	[10:14:16] their question had two levels to it. whether something is not needed for the proof, or whether something is not needed for the result. if its not needed for the proof, obv its not needed for the result. if its not needed for the result, it could still be needed for that particular proof
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Fangs	[10:14:58] the 1st seems fairly easy enough, the latter is hard.. their last line seems to indicate they are interested in the former
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[10:29:18] how many permutations the letters of the word COLUMNS? 7!  -- how many of them starts with letter 'C' ? (7-1)! ?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[10:36:47] yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[10:38:57] rendar: do you understand why?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	rendar	[10:39:05] yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lisp123	[10:39:15] cool :-)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lieven	[12:07:07] there's a famous result in number theory where the proof goes as follows: assume the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows. Assume the negation of the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:07:18] If X_j are random variables on R^n with law P and g is a function on R^n, then we know the expectation of Y_j = g(X_j) is int g(x) dP(x). But what about the expectaion of a sum, Z_j = (1/j) sum_k=1^j X_j? is it the anticipated double integral?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lieven	[12:07:24] intuitively one feels there should be a proof not mentioning RH
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mornfall	[12:10:10] lieven: would you say that any proof with case analysis should intuitively exist in a version without case analysis?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:10:28] Capso: more or less the same formula but with P being the law of the vector (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:11:23] ∫ g((x1+···+xj)/j) dP(x1,…,xj)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:13:43] oops, I need another variable: if k is a function on R^2n and we define, Z_j = (1/j) sum^j k(x,X_k) k(X_j, X_k)? what is E[Z]?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:15:33] nejimban: sorry, i boofed the original Q. how about this corrected Z_j? I would anticipate a double integral, but I've not seen it stated
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:16:07] what is x there?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:17:00] a fixed point, indeoendent of samples
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:17:11] I'm assuming X_j are iid
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:17:24] assuming k measurable, Z_j is a measurable function of (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:20:37] is j the summing variable?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:21:08] Capso: or you are summing from k=1 up to j
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:21:17] nejimban: the latter
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:21:51] so if the X_k are iid then E[Z] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:23:01] nejimban: how do we get a j in the expectation of Z?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:23:33] sorry it's Z_j not Z
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:24:20] (isn't Z=Z_j? what's Z otherwise?)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:25:14] I don't understand how the expectation of an rv can depend on j
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:26:22] j seems fixed here
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:26:30] nejimban: if X_j are iid then their expectation is int x dP(x) do you agree?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:26:41] you don't need iid
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:26:54] if X_j has law P then E[X_j] = ∫ xdP(x) yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:27:15] nejimban: now I'm defining a new rv, Z_j as above and I want its expectation
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:27:58] I just gave it to you
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:28:16] E[Z_j] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:28:37] I dont see how there can be a dependence on j?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:28:43] because Z_j depends on j?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:29:07] I might have not parsed your math correctly, could you use e.g. mathb.in?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:39:58] nejimban: mathb.in/61088
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:41:42] nejimban: there should be a (1/j) factor in the def of Z_j, but hopefully you get the idea now
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:43:16] Capso: my computation simplifies to (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:43:27] but I don't agree with the anticipated result you wrote
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:43:53] because the last summand of that sum is k(p, X_j)k(X_j,X_j)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:44:46] ok, i could be wrong, but do you agree that E[Z] can't depend on j?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:45:01] ah, wait, Z is the limit of Z_j?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:45:19] ah no I see
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:45:38] I hadn't got the def of Z, sorry
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:45:58] so yeah, E[Z] does not depend on j
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:46:19] it's (E[Z_1],E[Z_2],…) with E[Z_j] as I gave
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:46:43] I mean that would make no sense... law of large numbers says E[Z] = lim_N (1/N) sum_j^N Z_j
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:48:09] hm
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:48:17] nejimban: couldn't we just iterate LLN and see my result?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:48:34] there is a difference with Z = (Z_1,Z_2,…) and Z = lim Z_j
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:48:38] which is it?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:49:19] nejimban: could you clarify the difference?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:49:58] the first is a sequence of random variables, the second is just one random variable
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:51:13] nejimban: when you compute the expectation of X_j, which def do you use?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:51:48] i think it should be Z = (Z_1, ...)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:53:35] I don't understand what you mean
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:53:54] E[Z_j] = (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) tends to ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) as j \to ∞
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:54:12] so you get the value of E[Z] you wrote
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:56:15] ok, so by taking the E of each Z_j as a function of X_j' and then the E of E[Z_j]
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:57:42] yes one needs to distinguish the cases X_j ≠ X_j' and X_j = X_j'
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:57:58] because the laws of (X_j,X_j') differ
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:58:06] a
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nejimban	[12:58:51] (but as j->infinity the case X_j = X_j' becomes negligible)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[12:59:01] I see
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Capso	[13:03:14] nejimban: thanks, that was useful

2021-07-20 10:40:19	Galois	[02:59:43] for example, "pick a random rational number in the interval [0,1]"
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Galois	[03:00:09] for what should be obvious reasons, there does not exist any sigma-finite measure satisfying the stated properties
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:02:43] i think im missing the obvious reasons; wouldn't [0,1] be a countable union of intervals with finite length?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:03:30] i guess i cant really think about that, i don't exactly know what lebesgue measure is, even though i think im invoking it by talking about length
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Galois	[03:03:43] oh, sorry, I messed up. The problem is that this isn't a measure, not that it isn't a sigma-finite measure
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[03:04:50] just use the discrete measure on an uncountable set

2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:05:15] i think i might be asking this question prematurely; maybe i should get comfortable with different examples of measures before thinking about it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Galois	[03:06:33] you can also take the borel/lebesgue measure on the long line
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:06:58] its kind of cool that any countably additive function on an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the sigma algebra generated by that algebra; that seems like a strong statement to make
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:07:18] i cant wait for the appendix to hit me with a 5 page proof
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[03:07:30] it's pretty icky iirc
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[03:07:33] uses outer measures
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:08:45] it is in fact a 5 page proof
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:08:50] and does in fact use outer measures
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[03:09:43] short but icky I guess
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:10:10] i guess short depends on how many assumptions you take for granted or include as part of the proof heh
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:10:15] lemmas, i mean
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:11:13] cauchy's integral theorem is trivial if you just use green's theorem :)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	mefistofeles	[03:11:48] green's theorem tastes better with a bagel, btw
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:11:54] ;)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:12:18] this does make me want to learn some measure theory before going further, since it seems like there's a lot of development im taking for granted
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:12:24] probably a rabbit hole though, ill come back to it later lol
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:17:33] WOAH
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:17:51] i remember my analysis text giving a first glance at the cosntruction of lebesgue measure
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:18:21] but this book just hits you with the "it's the unique measure obtained by extending the countably additive "length" function on unions of intervals"
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:18:24] woaaaaah
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Galois	[03:19:23] I think that theorem is at https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/measure_theory/outer_measure.lean#L961
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Galois	[03:20:14] and yes, lean uses what you just said: def lebesgue_outer : outer_measure ℝ := outer_measure.of_function lebesgue_length lebesgue_length_empty
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:20:59] yeah my text calls it caratheodory's extension theorem
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[03:21:16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem
2021-07-20 10:40:19	darwin	[05:01:48] who was the guy who recited pi for 80 days?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	darwin	[05:48:33] i saw a UK billboard sign "Football: It's Our Religion" (football in most the world, but in USA a.k.a. soccer) so I want to see a billboard sign with people in ancient/Classical Greek clothes "Mathematics: It's Our Religion"
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[06:14:38] people in antiquity used to sometimes kill each other over math disputes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	astronaut	[06:22:02] pascal lost an eye in a math dispute
2021-07-20 10:40:19	astronaut	[06:22:08] or was it cardano?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[06:34:58] i dont think it was pascal
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[06:55:09] there are uncountably many strictly increasing maps from N to N, right
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[06:56:01] since, given such a function f, for any n in the domain of f, there are countably many choices for f, even when considering the increasing constraint
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[06:56:59] yeah that's obvious; man i feel so rusty already
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lieven	[07:00:14] one way of easily seeing this is noting that each such function is uniquely described by its increment at each point of N
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[07:01:46] that's a nice way of looking at it, yeah
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lieven	[07:02:35] well, its increments and its starting value of course
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[07:03:43] huh, x^2+x+1 | x^4n - x^n
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[07:03:45] thats crazy
2021-07-20 10:40:19	PlanckWalk	[07:03:59] There are even uncountably many that just increase by 1 or 2 at each step.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	PlanckWalk	[07:05:58] (x-1)(x^2+x+1) = x^3 - 1, x^(4n) - x^n = x^n (x^(3n) - 1), and x^3-1 divides x^(3n) - 1.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[07:06:10] nice!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	alphamul2	[07:13:24] Hmm, wasn't there a school that got burned down because they wouldn't let this one guy go to it, that then spread the teachings across the continent because of fleeing students?  XD
2021-07-20 10:40:19	alphamul2	[07:13:48] Man, that was Greece, wasn't it?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[08:20:16] how do I prove that x^2 - y^3 = 1 has no integer solutions?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[08:26:10] that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[08:27:24] anyways x=3, y=2 solves. you probably mean no other than that.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[08:32:21] what about the special case: y can't be odd
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[08:32:47] x=3,y=2 is the only solution
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[08:33:07] yeah, I'm trying to prove that y can't be odd
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[08:35:56] x^2 - 1 = y^3 <=> (x+1)(x-1) = y^3
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[08:40:17] assuming y is odd, then x+1 and x-1 are consecutive odd numbers. so x+1 and x-1 are coprime
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[08:40:45] this also implies that x+1 and x-1 are cubes. but this is impossible since there are not 2-apart cubes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	cherim__	[08:40:54] "that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time" -- what?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	cherim__	[08:41:07] Mixing with 3^x-2^y=1?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[08:41:35] we arrive at a contradiction, so y can't be odd
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[08:41:40] is my proof correct?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[08:53:11] n!/n1!*n2!*..*nk!    gives me the total permutations of a set of n objects, with k "kinds" of these objects, right?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[08:54:51] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[08:55:02] rendar ^
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[08:55:25] now my question is:
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[08:55:33] n1+n2+...+nk must be = n ?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[08:55:39] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[08:55:55] otherwise if it's different than n, what am i getting?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[08:56:10] nᵢ is the number of objects of type i. the sum over the types must be the total amount.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[08:56:55] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem#Number_of_unique_permutations_of_words
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:02:23] yeah
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:02:49] but if i specify a number different than n, i'm not getting permutations, but some other result.. not related to permutations i guess
2021-07-20 10:40:19	cherim__	[09:05:55] Possibly not even integer, so not necessarily combinatorially interpretable
2021-07-20 10:40:19	cherim__	[09:07:35] If the sum is <=n, you can assume it's padded with 1!1!..1! though
2021-07-20 10:40:19	cherim__	[09:07:51] With a clear combinatorial meaning
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:09:05] if the sum is ≤ n it's not a padding issue at all. what's happened is you've not counted all the "kinds".
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:09:24] or it's a mispecified problem
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:09:37] at that point it's no longer math but sorcery to determine what is happening.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:14:40] qergle: but if i have a set of 10 objects, 7 of a kind, 1 of a kind, 1 of a kind and 1 of a kind, i'll get: 10!/7!1!1!1! = 10!/7!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:14:42] right?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:15:00] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:15:21] so it's not math sorcery, it's a real thing
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:15:34] it's not
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:15:39] this still holds: <rendar> n1+n2+...+nk must be = n
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:15:44] 7+1+1+1=10
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:15:53] yeah
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:16:07] ok bbl.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:16:14] so cherim__ was right that if we have <n we can consider that with padding 1!1!1!..!1
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:16:29] if what is <n?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:17:11] n1+n2+...+nk < n
2021-07-20 10:40:19	qergle	[09:17:18] you don't have that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:17:53] ok
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:39:15] if i have 10 sports game and 5 arcade games, if i pick 5 games, how many ways are there that i get 3 arcade games and 2 sports game? nCr(10,3)*nCr(5,2) = 120*10 = 1200
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:39:20] this is correct, right?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:40:38] i can't get why the book uses nCr operation 2 times
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[09:44:55] rendar: C(10,3) * C(5,2) is correct, but what is the question?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:45:28] int-e: my calculator calls that C() operation nCr
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[09:45:40] that's fine, I'm too lazy to type that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[09:46:02] and I don't like the look of 10C3 * 5C2 (which is the notation that that nCr derives from)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:46:50] right
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:47:05] int-e: my question is: why i have to use C() 2 times?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[09:47:43] rendar: Because you're selecting 3 aracde games (that's one C) and 2 sports games (that's the other one)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:48:35] sorry, i misread the excersise!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[09:48:43] yeah, it's clear now
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:51:07] Hi all, a question
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:51:56] I want to understand better how to determine whether an assumption in a set of assumptions is REQUIRED for a proof or is superfluous to the probelm at hand
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:52:25] e.g.  x = 5 & y = 6 & z = 7, therefore x + y = 11 (z is completely unrelated)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:52:40] But not just for this simple example, but more generally to all proofs
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:52:50] Can anybody point me in the right direction?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lieven	[09:55:16] you can try to find counterexamples to theorems if you leave out one of the assumptions
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[09:55:51] lisp123: well, an assumption is superfluous if there's a proof not using the assumption. so identifying required assumptions seems more useful, and you can do that by finding counterexamples to the theorem without the assumption in question
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[09:56:32] (note that required assumptions may still be stronger than necessary)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lieven	[09:57:11] in a more advanced way there's the field of reverse mathematics that works out to what extent theorems have equivalent logical power to their assumptions. Stillwell wrote a fairly accessible account on it.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:58:12] thanks int-e & lieven
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:58:53] I'm trying to find a way of identifying superfluous conditions without prior knowledge of the required assumptions
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:59:14] lieven: thanks for this reverse mathematics lead, I will look into Stillwell now
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[09:59:58] One thing I was thinking, was that if the result of a theorem is expressed in certain variables, e.g. x & y, then checking all the input assumptions - one could disregard any assumption that has no relation AT ALL to the variables used in the result?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[10:00:52] heh, even if a theorem is equivalent to its assumptions, the assumptions may be redundant.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[10:02:16] int-e: thanks, i agree. However would my approach at least strip out some basic assumptions (i.e. some but not all), or would you know if it could be flawed in the sense that some assumptions are incorrectly kicked out?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[10:02:20] s/a theorem/a theorem's conclusion/
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[10:13:00] lieven: if your assumption is never used in the proof, then it is superfluous (to the proof, and hence the result)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[10:13:06] oh they left
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[10:14:16] their question had two levels to it. whether something is not needed for the proof, or whether something is not needed for the result. if its not needed for the proof, obv its not needed for the result. if its not needed for the result, it could still be needed for that particular proof
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[10:14:58] the 1st seems fairly easy enough, the latter is hard.. their last line seems to indicate they are interested in the former
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[10:29:18] how many permutations the letters of the word COLUMNS? 7!  -- how many of them starts with letter 'C' ? (7-1)! ?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[10:36:47] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[10:38:57] rendar: do you understand why?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rendar	[10:39:05] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lisp123	[10:39:15] cool :-)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lieven	[12:07:07] there's a famous result in number theory where the proof goes as follows: assume the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows. Assume the negation of the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:07:18] If X_j are random variables on R^n with law P and g is a function on R^n, then we know the expectation of Y_j = g(X_j) is int g(x) dP(x). But what about the expectaion of a sum, Z_j = (1/j) sum_k=1^j X_j? is it the anticipated double integral?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	lieven	[12:07:24] intuitively one feels there should be a proof not mentioning RH
2021-07-20 10:40:19	mornfall	[12:10:10] lieven: would you say that any proof with case analysis should intuitively exist in a version without case analysis?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:10:28] Capso: more or less the same formula but with P being the law of the vector (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:11:23] ∫ g((x1+···+xj)/j) dP(x1,…,xj)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:13:43] oops, I need another variable: if k is a function on R^2n and we define, Z_j = (1/j) sum^j k(x,X_k) k(X_j, X_k)? what is E[Z]?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:15:33] nejimban: sorry, i boofed the original Q. how about this corrected Z_j? I would anticipate a double integral, but I've not seen it stated
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:16:07] what is x there?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:17:00] a fixed point, indeoendent of samples
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:17:11] I'm assuming X_j are iid
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:17:24] assuming k measurable, Z_j is a measurable function of (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:20:37] is j the summing variable?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:21:08] Capso: or you are summing from k=1 up to j
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:21:17] nejimban: the latter
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:21:51] so if the X_k are iid then E[Z] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:23:01] nejimban: how do we get a j in the expectation of Z?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:23:33] sorry it's Z_j not Z
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:24:20] (isn't Z=Z_j? what's Z otherwise?)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:25:14] I don't understand how the expectation of an rv can depend on j
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:26:22] j seems fixed here
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:26:30] nejimban: if X_j are iid then their expectation is int x dP(x) do you agree?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:26:41] you don't need iid
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:26:54] if X_j has law P then E[X_j] = ∫ xdP(x) yes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:27:15] nejimban: now I'm defining a new rv, Z_j as above and I want its expectation
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:27:58] I just gave it to you
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:28:16] E[Z_j] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:28:37] I dont see how there can be a dependence on j?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:28:43] because Z_j depends on j?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:29:07] I might have not parsed your math correctly, could you use e.g. mathb.in?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:39:58] nejimban: mathb.in/61088
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:41:42] nejimban: there should be a (1/j) factor in the def of Z_j, but hopefully you get the idea now
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:43:16] Capso: my computation simplifies to (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:43:27] but I don't agree with the anticipated result you wrote
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:43:53] because the last summand of that sum is k(p, X_j)k(X_j,X_j)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:44:46] ok, i could be wrong, but do you agree that E[Z] can't depend on j?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:45:01] ah, wait, Z is the limit of Z_j?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:45:19] ah no I see
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:45:38] I hadn't got the def of Z, sorry
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:45:58] so yeah, E[Z] does not depend on j
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:46:19] it's (E[Z_1],E[Z_2],…) with E[Z_j] as I gave
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:46:43] I mean that would make no sense... law of large numbers says E[Z] = lim_N (1/N) sum_j^N Z_j
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:48:09] hm
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:48:17] nejimban: couldn't we just iterate LLN and see my result?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:48:34] there is a difference with Z = (Z_1,Z_2,…) and Z = lim Z_j
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:48:38] which is it?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:49:19] nejimban: could you clarify the difference?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:49:58] the first is a sequence of random variables, the second is just one random variable
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:51:13] nejimban: when you compute the expectation of X_j, which def do you use?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:51:48] i think it should be Z = (Z_1, ...)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:53:35] I don't understand what you mean
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:53:54] E[Z_j] = (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) tends to ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) as j \to ∞
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:54:12] so you get the value of E[Z] you wrote
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:56:15] ok, so by taking the E of each Z_j as a function of X_j' and then the E of E[Z_j]
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:57:42] yes one needs to distinguish the cases X_j ≠ X_j' and X_j = X_j'
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:57:58] because the laws of (X_j,X_j') differ
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:58:06] a
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[12:58:51] (but as j->infinity the case X_j = X_j' becomes negligible)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[12:59:01] I see
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[13:03:14] nejimban: thanks, that was useful
2021-07-20 10:40:19	biberao	[13:33:06] hi
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Neologik	[13:36:21] how do you traverse an infinite?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Z-module	[14:01:06] cherim__: : pretty sure the famous recently-solved thing that qergle referred to was for general exponents > 1, not just 2 and 3. Recent is 19 years ago.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture
2021-07-20 10:40:19	taeaad	[16:07:13] What is that theorem that says in constructive mathematics all functions are continuous?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[16:08:00] brower continuity theorem
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[16:08:03] brouwer
2021-07-20 10:40:19	taeaad	[16:10:13] riv: Thanks!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	taeaad	[16:10:59] I remember the lecturer going through the whole thing step by step. I was more surprised by the lecturer's thoroughness than I was disappointed in myself for not being able to follow everything.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[16:11:15] oh i haven't seen an actual proof of it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Donitz	[16:12:35] I have a circle with radius r. position 0,0 is at 0 degrees at the edge of the circle
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Donitz	[16:12:46] how can I figure out what angle was used to get to position x,y
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Donitz	[16:13:59] angle less than 90 degrees
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Donitz	[16:14:42] oh wait. I think I just figured it out
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Donitz	[16:15:41] asin(y)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Donitz	[16:16:36] umm... asin(y / radius)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Dotz0cat	[16:21:12] Say I have 2 functions. How would I combine them to get a position vector?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Z-module	[16:21:55] functions from what to what?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	buster	[16:23:33] Donitz, atan(y/x), or atan2(y,x) if you allow yourself that luxury
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Donitz	[16:23:57] works too, but when under 90 degrees I think asin works just as well
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Donitz	[16:24:07] otherwise obviously it can go back down again
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Dotz0cat	[16:32:20] 2 functions because there is a plus or minus in them. I would like to get them to a vector form. A single vector so I don't have to work with 2 functions
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Z-module	[16:33:34] atan(y/x) is a crock
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Z-module	[16:33:40] atan2() is the only sane way
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tusko	[17:11:45] use the substitution u = y/x
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[17:40:53] good morning
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:10:13] is time real ?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:10:18] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[18:13:49] yes time is real
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tusko	[18:16:21] no
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tusko	[18:16:29] time is relative
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[18:17:11] how does that make it not real
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tusko	[18:20:49] Well, it just doesn't really exist.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tusko	[18:21:17] It requires a reference point, and even then it is not fixed but constantly evolving.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:22:29] why is there a direction of time ?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:22:48] when the reference points are in space ?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:23:11] so how can it be opposing directional ?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:23:35] let the other directions aside.....
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[18:25:27] tusko, you are wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[18:26:03] Inline, that's a hard question but in terms of physics - even though many physical laws are reversible, entropy isn't
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tusko	[18:27:15] If a rainbow, sprinkle colored unicorn exploded atthe center of the earth, what time did it happen?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[18:27:38] absolute nonsense
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[18:27:41] this may be wandering too far
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:28:19] ok
2021-07-20 10:40:19	 *	Inline [18:54:36] wants a logarithmic mechanical clock for his birthday!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:54:46] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:56:18] so if i used a non homogeneous clock time would be non equally distributed
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:59:04] deez clocks are all out of fashion
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:59:12] i don't feel no time pressure at all!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Inline	[18:59:17] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Dotz0cat	[19:30:13] Say what would I get if I integrated an gradient?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tusko	[19:37:59] wouldn't that return the function by the fundamental theorem of calculus?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[19:39:37] What does it mean to 'integrate a vector'?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rex	[19:42:58] biberao: can you read me?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	kmh	[19:43:06] indeed
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rex	[19:43:27] somiaj: that depends; in what context are you asking
2021-07-20 10:40:19	kmh	[19:43:59] Dotz0cat,'s question i presume
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rex	[19:44:23] I see
2021-07-20 10:40:19	biberao	[19:45:40] rex: yes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	biberao	[19:46:04] brb
2021-07-20 10:40:19	biberao	[19:46:08] going to send a fax
2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[19:47:32] rex: the question was for Dotz0cat who asked about integrating an gardient.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	rex	[19:48:37] ok thx :)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[20:45:05] nejimban: ping, have a follow up q
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[21:00:20] Capso: here
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Guest78	[21:06:14] hello
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Guest78	[21:06:17] 1+1 = ?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[21:15:29] 2
2021-07-20 10:40:19	seL4	[21:24:40] can you determine the probability of the decidability of a program written for a turing machine?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[21:26:57] i th ink you can approximate it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[21:27:01] if you weight small programs more
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[21:27:08] but it will be uncomputable
2021-07-20 10:40:19	seL4	[21:29:25] why is the probability uncomputable?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[21:30:50] well the program may be nontrivial e.g. may have an interpreter for a programming language in it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	PinealGlandOptic	[21:31:07] Hi all. What software packages do you know for solving integer linear problems? Wolfram, SymPy, what else?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[21:31:25] nejimban: hey
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[21:33:19] so you can't compute the probability by computing whether it halts on not on each input and adding it up. We actually need to argue conversely, if you could compute the probability exactly that would help you check halting.. but that isn't clear
2021-07-20 10:40:19	PinealGlandOptic	[21:34:03] There was ##math-software on Freenode. Seems not migrated?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[21:40:24] nejimban: Previously we saw that the Z_j = sum_{j'} k(x,X_j') k(X_j', X_j) have expectation given by int k(x,y) int k(y,y') dP(y') dP(y). Say Z_j = k^(2), the exponent denoting the iteration level and suppose we have a convergent Taylor series f(z) = sum_m c_m z^m. Then, does it follow that if we replace z^m with k^(m)_j then the Taylor series has expectation given by the Taylor series with the z^k replaced
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[21:40:30] with iterated integrals?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	seL4	[21:41:19] thanks riv
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[21:42:01] so I can't say 100% its uncomputable
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[21:42:01] Capso: not sure I understood all that :D
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[21:42:32] nejimban: hang on, I'll mathbin
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Dotz0cat	[21:48:09] I am probably not gonna do anything on this today. I have a polar function of theta and r. What would I need to go through to find a PDE with the polar function as a solution?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	seL4	[22:08:37] does the approximation of the probability of the decidability of a program run on a turing machine depend on the number of states of the turing machine?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	seL4	[22:09:14] or I mean, does the approximation of the probability decrease as the number of states of the turing machine increases?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Panther	[22:10:11] https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/07/11/self-cleaning-turing-machine.html
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Panther	[22:10:46] That doesn't answer the question, but coincidentally, I was just looking at that.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[22:13:40] seL4, btw
2021-07-20 10:40:19	riv	[22:13:51] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant related? maybe
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[22:16:17] nejimban: mathb.in/61120
2021-07-20 10:40:19	seL4	[22:17:00] so you can't approximate the probability?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:19:01] Capso: seems interesting (and plausible)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:19:12] I am going to bed soon though
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:20:07] did you make it work for polynomial f?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:20:36] (or, like, just m=3, say)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:21:39] if basic induction works I'm guessing one needs to show that the limits in m and N 'commute'
2021-07-20 10:40:19	dogbert2	[22:25:14] math fail - why estimating the weight of explosives in a containment vessel (instead of actually weighing it) is a very bad idea :)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[22:27:11] nejimban: polynomials are ok because I can bruteforce triangle inequality them
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[22:28:16] nejimban: problem comes in going to infinitely many terms with an alternating series... I need a better convergence method
2021-07-20 10:40:19	seL4	[22:28:53] thanks, riv
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tolarz	[22:33:05] btw, there are universal turing machines with < 5 states
2021-07-20 10:40:19	tolarz	[22:33:21] oh seL4 left
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:36:53] Capso: if k is bounded it should work too
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[22:41:40] nejimban: yea, let's say k is bdd, i forgot to include that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[22:42:34] nejimban: how would that work? say, just exp(-x) ... the limiting series is exponentially increasing
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:49:54] Capso: you can bound k^(m) by ||k||^m to get normal convergence of ∑ cₘk⁽m)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:50:27] assuming the power series associated with c_m has infinite radius
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:50:42] or at least ||k||
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:51:36] this should allow to Fubinize sum and expectation
2021-07-20 10:40:19	nejimban	[22:52:17] I'm too tired to write the details
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Capso	[23:22:53] nejimban: normal convergence of whay, sorry? on this interface I can't parse the unicode
2021-07-20 10:40:19	mouseghost	[23:23:15] \sum c_m k (m)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	mouseghost	[23:23:40] or maybe \sum c_m k^m
2021-07-20 10:40:19	mouseghost	[23:23:42] im not sure
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[00:30:42] why is measure theory considered dry? seems like the results are pretty deep / powerful?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	greenbagels	[00:32:14] PinealGlandOptic: it was a dead channel on freenode

2021-07-20 10:40:19	Z-module	[02:15:39] yes, that's always 2 (only one of those is a multiple of 4, and no odd prime can divide both)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[02:16:56] Z-module: thanks
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[02:37:37] how do I prove that the only consecutive even numbers whose product is a cube is 2 & 4?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[02:43:05] 2 + 4 = 6 is a cube?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Z-module	[02:43:13] product
2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[02:43:18] grr, yea read that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[02:43:26] just read..
2021-07-20 10:40:19	dude12312414	[02:45:28] missed
2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[02:47:07] Well it is equivlant to show that n(n+1)/2 is only a cube if n=1, which intuitivy seems true since n and n+1 won't have enough common factors to be a cube.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[02:47:19] it reduces to showing that the only integer solution of x^3 + 1 = 2y^3 is (x,y) = (1,1)...
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[02:48:09] you are solving (n+1)(n-1) = x^3 where n +1 and n - 1 are odd
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[02:48:19] so they are relatively prive
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[02:48:21] prime
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[02:48:26] (we may assume w.l.o.g. that n is odd (we can switch to -n-1 otherwise), and let n = x^3)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[02:48:28] hence both cubes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[02:48:42] i.e n+1 and n -1 are cubes that differ by 2
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[02:49:13] frelleck: you dropped the factor 2
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[02:49:17] oops
2021-07-20 10:40:19	 *	frelleck [02:49:34] looks around for a 2

2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[02:51:24] You missed a few suggestions, I noted that it is equivlant to showing that n(n+1)/2 is a cube iff n=1.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[02:51:32] sad, IP revealed
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo_	[02:51:49] last message I saw:  frelleck looks around for a 2
2021-07-20 10:40:19	frelleck	[02:52:01] that's the last one
2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[02:52:06] then you didn't miss much
2021-07-20 10:40:19	int-e	[02:55:01] oh there are the silly -2 * 0 = 0 * 2 = 0, of course.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	somiaj	[02:56:36] well 0*2 = 0 could be considered a cube.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Z-module	[02:58:02] So you need n, n+1 where n > 1, one of n, n+1 is an odd cube j^3, and other other is 2^a times an odd cube k^3 with j coprime to k.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Z-module	[02:59:14] and such that  2 + a  is a multiple of 3
2021-07-20 10:40:19	paulo___	[03:44:37] thanks
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pikapika	[04:42:04] How did people make angular scales before ramsdens machine?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pikapika	[04:43:52] I read somewhere some craftsmen still basically just used a fixed arc length to cut off the circle
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pikapika	[04:43:58] How true is that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pikapika	[04:46:33] ie with a caliper or such set to the arc length
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:52:30] loopspace: do you know how people say reading 'french math' is not hard, even if you dont know french
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:53:08] can you do that? (how do people do that? been trying to read this text, with help of google translate "addon" or w/e widget in chrome.. its slow and annoying)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:53:21] I tried looking for an alternative source, I can't find it either...
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pikapika	[04:53:44] Fangs, french is supposed to be not too hard for english speakers
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:54:32] grammar and sentence structure is similar, supposedly. so "word by word" translation should get you most of the way
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pikapika	[04:55:35] Fangs, vocabulary also has a lot in common: English has borrowed a lot from French
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:55:35] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BxtLWcMM/Screenshot%20(83).png
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pikapika	[04:55:49] You'd be surprised, very common words like 'purchase' are actually french
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:56:08] I can see "graduation" <-> "grading" etc
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:56:28] pikapika: just feels a bit uneasy having to "guess" what the text meant
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:56:45] (esp with maths where precision is necessary)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pikapika	[04:56:47] Fangs, thats actually quite fun to do...at least with a non-technical work
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:57:46] pikapika: this guy's computation is based on objects defined here
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:57:59] and his paper does have an 'appendix' attempting to re-explain everything
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[04:58:12] but I think I'm still forced to read this french source
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Fangs	[05:00:48] wonder if I can go to fiver or something and just commsion someone to translate these for $5

2021-07-20 10:40:40	Galois	[02:59:43] for example, "pick a random rational number in the interval [0,1]"
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Galois	[03:00:09] for what should be obvious reasons, there does not exist any sigma-finite measure satisfying the stated properties
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:02:43] i think im missing the obvious reasons; wouldn't [0,1] be a countable union of intervals with finite length?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:03:30] i guess i cant really think about that, i don't exactly know what lebesgue measure is, even though i think im invoking it by talking about length
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Galois	[03:03:43] oh, sorry, I messed up. The problem is that this isn't a measure, not that it isn't a sigma-finite measure
2021-07-20 10:40:40	frelleck	[03:04:50] just use the discrete measure on an uncountable set
2021-07-20 10:40:40	frelleck	[03:05:02] I don't know how natural that is but it's an easy example
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:05:15] i think i might be asking this question prematurely; maybe i should get comfortable with different examples of measures before thinking about it
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Galois	[03:06:33] you can also take the borel/lebesgue measure on the long line
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:06:58] its kind of cool that any countably additive function on an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the sigma algebra generated by that algebra; that seems like a strong statement to make
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:07:18] i cant wait for the appendix to hit me with a 5 page proof
2021-07-20 10:40:40	frelleck	[03:07:30] it's pretty icky iirc
2021-07-20 10:40:40	frelleck	[03:07:33] uses outer measures
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:08:45] it is in fact a 5 page proof
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:08:50] and does in fact use outer measures
2021-07-20 10:40:40	frelleck	[03:09:43] short but icky I guess
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:10:10] i guess short depends on how many assumptions you take for granted or include as part of the proof heh
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:10:15] lemmas, i mean
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:11:13] cauchy's integral theorem is trivial if you just use green's theorem :)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	mefistofeles	[03:11:48] green's theorem tastes better with a bagel, btw
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:11:54] ;)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:12:18] this does make me want to learn some measure theory before going further, since it seems like there's a lot of development im taking for granted
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:12:24] probably a rabbit hole though, ill come back to it later lol
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:17:33] WOAH
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:17:51] i remember my analysis text giving a first glance at the cosntruction of lebesgue measure
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:18:21] but this book just hits you with the "it's the unique measure obtained by extending the countably additive "length" function on unions of intervals"
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:18:24] woaaaaah
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Galois	[03:19:23] I think that theorem is at https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/measure_theory/outer_measure.lean#L961
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Galois	[03:20:14] and yes, lean uses what you just said: def lebesgue_outer : outer_measure ℝ := outer_measure.of_function lebesgue_length lebesgue_length_empty
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:20:59] yeah my text calls it caratheodory's extension theorem
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[03:21:16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem
2021-07-20 10:40:40	darwin	[05:01:48] who was the guy who recited pi for 80 days?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	darwin	[05:48:33] i saw a UK billboard sign "Football: It's Our Religion" (football in most the world, but in USA a.k.a. soccer) so I want to see a billboard sign with people in ancient/Classical Greek clothes "Mathematics: It's Our Religion"
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[06:14:38] people in antiquity used to sometimes kill each other over math disputes
2021-07-20 10:40:40	astronaut	[06:22:02] pascal lost an eye in a math dispute
2021-07-20 10:40:40	astronaut	[06:22:08] or was it cardano?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[06:34:58] i dont think it was pascal
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[06:55:09] there are uncountably many strictly increasing maps from N to N, right
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[06:56:01] since, given such a function f, for any n in the domain of f, there are countably many choices for f, even when considering the increasing constraint
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[06:56:59] yeah that's obvious; man i feel so rusty already
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lieven	[07:00:14] one way of easily seeing this is noting that each such function is uniquely described by its increment at each point of N
2021-07-20 10:40:40	greenbagels	[07:01:46] that's a nice way of looking at it, yeah
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lieven	[07:02:35] well, its increments and its starting value of course
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[07:03:43] huh, x^2+x+1 | x^4n - x^n
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[07:03:45] thats crazy
2021-07-20 10:40:40	PlanckWalk	[07:03:59] There are even uncountably many that just increase by 1 or 2 at each step.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	PlanckWalk	[07:05:58] (x-1)(x^2+x+1) = x^3 - 1, x^(4n) - x^n = x^n (x^(3n) - 1), and x^3-1 divides x^(3n) - 1.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[07:06:10] nice!
2021-07-20 10:40:40	alphamul2	[07:13:24] Hmm, wasn't there a school that got burned down because they wouldn't let this one guy go to it, that then spread the teachings across the continent because of fleeing students?  XD
2021-07-20 10:40:40	alphamul2	[07:13:48] Man, that was Greece, wasn't it?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[08:20:16] how do I prove that x^2 - y^3 = 1 has no integer solutions?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[08:26:10] that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[08:27:24] anyways x=3, y=2 solves. you probably mean no other than that.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[08:32:21] what about the special case: y can't be odd
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[08:32:47] x=3,y=2 is the only solution
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[08:33:07] yeah, I'm trying to prove that y can't be odd
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[08:35:56] x^2 - 1 = y^3 <=> (x+1)(x-1) = y^3
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[08:40:17] assuming y is odd, then x+1 and x-1 are consecutive odd numbers. so x+1 and x-1 are coprime
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[08:40:45] this also implies that x+1 and x-1 are cubes. but this is impossible since there are not 2-apart cubes
2021-07-20 10:40:40	cherim__	[08:40:54] "that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time" -- what?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	cherim__	[08:41:07] Mixing with 3^x-2^y=1?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[08:41:35] we arrive at a contradiction, so y can't be odd
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[08:41:40] is my proof correct?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[08:53:11] n!/n1!*n2!*..*nk!    gives me the total permutations of a set of n objects, with k "kinds" of these objects, right?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[08:54:51] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[08:55:02] rendar ^
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[08:55:25] now my question is:
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[08:55:33] n1+n2+...+nk must be = n ?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[08:55:39] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[08:55:55] otherwise if it's different than n, what am i getting?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[08:56:10] nᵢ is the number of objects of type i. the sum over the types must be the total amount.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[08:56:55] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem#Number_of_unique_permutations_of_words
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:02:23] yeah
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:02:49] but if i specify a number different than n, i'm not getting permutations, but some other result.. not related to permutations i guess
2021-07-20 10:40:40	cherim__	[09:05:55] Possibly not even integer, so not necessarily combinatorially interpretable
2021-07-20 10:40:40	cherim__	[09:07:35] If the sum is <=n, you can assume it's padded with 1!1!..1! though
2021-07-20 10:40:40	cherim__	[09:07:51] With a clear combinatorial meaning
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:09:05] if the sum is ≤ n it's not a padding issue at all. what's happened is you've not counted all the "kinds".
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:09:24] or it's a mispecified problem
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:09:37] at that point it's no longer math but sorcery to determine what is happening.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:14:40] qergle: but if i have a set of 10 objects, 7 of a kind, 1 of a kind, 1 of a kind and 1 of a kind, i'll get: 10!/7!1!1!1! = 10!/7!
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:14:42] right?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:15:00] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:15:21] so it's not math sorcery, it's a real thing
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:15:34] it's not
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:15:39] this still holds: <rendar> n1+n2+...+nk must be = n
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:15:44] 7+1+1+1=10
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:15:53] yeah
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:16:07] ok bbl.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:16:14] so cherim__ was right that if we have <n we can consider that with padding 1!1!1!..!1
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:16:29] if what is <n?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:17:11] n1+n2+...+nk < n
2021-07-20 10:40:40	qergle	[09:17:18] you don't have that
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:17:53] ok
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:39:15] if i have 10 sports game and 5 arcade games, if i pick 5 games, how many ways are there that i get 3 arcade games and 2 sports game? nCr(10,3)*nCr(5,2) = 120*10 = 1200
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:39:20] this is correct, right?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:40:38] i can't get why the book uses nCr operation 2 times
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[09:44:55] rendar: C(10,3) * C(5,2) is correct, but what is the question?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:45:28] int-e: my calculator calls that C() operation nCr
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[09:45:40] that's fine, I'm too lazy to type that
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[09:46:02] and I don't like the look of 10C3 * 5C2 (which is the notation that that nCr derives from)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:46:50] right
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:47:05] int-e: my question is: why i have to use C() 2 times?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[09:47:43] rendar: Because you're selecting 3 aracde games (that's one C) and 2 sports games (that's the other one)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:48:35] sorry, i misread the excersise!
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[09:48:43] yeah, it's clear now
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:51:07] Hi all, a question
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:51:56] I want to understand better how to determine whether an assumption in a set of assumptions is REQUIRED for a proof or is superfluous to the probelm at hand
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:52:25] e.g.  x = 5 & y = 6 & z = 7, therefore x + y = 11 (z is completely unrelated)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:52:40] But not just for this simple example, but more generally to all proofs
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:52:50] Can anybody point me in the right direction?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lieven	[09:55:16] you can try to find counterexamples to theorems if you leave out one of the assumptions
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[09:55:51] lisp123: well, an assumption is superfluous if there's a proof not using the assumption. so identifying required assumptions seems more useful, and you can do that by finding counterexamples to the theorem without the assumption in question
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[09:56:32] (note that required assumptions may still be stronger than necessary)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lieven	[09:57:11] in a more advanced way there's the field of reverse mathematics that works out to what extent theorems have equivalent logical power to their assumptions. Stillwell wrote a fairly accessible account on it.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:58:12] thanks int-e & lieven
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:58:53] I'm trying to find a way of identifying superfluous conditions without prior knowledge of the required assumptions
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:59:14] lieven: thanks for this reverse mathematics lead, I will look into Stillwell now
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[09:59:58] One thing I was thinking, was that if the result of a theorem is expressed in certain variables, e.g. x & y, then checking all the input assumptions - one could disregard any assumption that has no relation AT ALL to the variables used in the result?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[10:00:52] heh, even if a theorem is equivalent to its assumptions, the assumptions may be redundant.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[10:02:16] int-e: thanks, i agree. However would my approach at least strip out some basic assumptions (i.e. some but not all), or would you know if it could be flawed in the sense that some assumptions are incorrectly kicked out?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[10:02:20] s/a theorem/a theorem's conclusion/
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Fangs	[10:13:00] lieven: if your assumption is never used in the proof, then it is superfluous (to the proof, and hence the result)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Fangs	[10:13:06] oh they left
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Fangs	[10:14:16] their question had two levels to it. whether something is not needed for the proof, or whether something is not needed for the result. if its not needed for the proof, obv its not needed for the result. if its not needed for the result, it could still be needed for that particular proof
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Fangs	[10:14:58] the 1st seems fairly easy enough, the latter is hard.. their last line seems to indicate they are interested in the former
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[10:29:18] how many permutations the letters of the word COLUMNS? 7!  -- how many of them starts with letter 'C' ? (7-1)! ?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[10:36:47] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[10:38:57] rendar: do you understand why?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rendar	[10:39:05] yes
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lisp123	[10:39:15] cool :-)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lieven	[12:07:07] there's a famous result in number theory where the proof goes as follows: assume the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows. Assume the negation of the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:07:18] If X_j are random variables on R^n with law P and g is a function on R^n, then we know the expectation of Y_j = g(X_j) is int g(x) dP(x). But what about the expectaion of a sum, Z_j = (1/j) sum_k=1^j X_j? is it the anticipated double integral?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	lieven	[12:07:24] intuitively one feels there should be a proof not mentioning RH
2021-07-20 10:40:40	mornfall	[12:10:10] lieven: would you say that any proof with case analysis should intuitively exist in a version without case analysis?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:10:28] Capso: more or less the same formula but with P being the law of the vector (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:11:23] ∫ g((x1+···+xj)/j) dP(x1,…,xj)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:13:43] oops, I need another variable: if k is a function on R^2n and we define, Z_j = (1/j) sum^j k(x,X_k) k(X_j, X_k)? what is E[Z]?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:15:33] nejimban: sorry, i boofed the original Q. how about this corrected Z_j? I would anticipate a double integral, but I've not seen it stated
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:16:07] what is x there?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:17:00] a fixed point, indeoendent of samples
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:17:11] I'm assuming X_j are iid
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:17:24] assuming k measurable, Z_j is a measurable function of (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:20:37] is j the summing variable?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:21:08] Capso: or you are summing from k=1 up to j
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:21:17] nejimban: the latter
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:21:51] so if the X_k are iid then E[Z] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:23:01] nejimban: how do we get a j in the expectation of Z?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:23:33] sorry it's Z_j not Z
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:24:20] (isn't Z=Z_j? what's Z otherwise?)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:25:14] I don't understand how the expectation of an rv can depend on j
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:26:22] j seems fixed here
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:26:30] nejimban: if X_j are iid then their expectation is int x dP(x) do you agree?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:26:41] you don't need iid
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:26:54] if X_j has law P then E[X_j] = ∫ xdP(x) yes
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:27:15] nejimban: now I'm defining a new rv, Z_j as above and I want its expectation
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:27:58] I just gave it to you
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:28:16] E[Z_j] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:28:37] I dont see how there can be a dependence on j?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:28:43] because Z_j depends on j?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:29:07] I might have not parsed your math correctly, could you use e.g. mathb.in?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:39:58] nejimban: mathb.in/61088
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:41:42] nejimban: there should be a (1/j) factor in the def of Z_j, but hopefully you get the idea now
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:43:16] Capso: my computation simplifies to (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:43:27] but I don't agree with the anticipated result you wrote
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:43:53] because the last summand of that sum is k(p, X_j)k(X_j,X_j)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:44:46] ok, i could be wrong, but do you agree that E[Z] can't depend on j?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:45:01] ah, wait, Z is the limit of Z_j?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:45:19] ah no I see
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:45:38] I hadn't got the def of Z, sorry
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:45:58] so yeah, E[Z] does not depend on j
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:46:19] it's (E[Z_1],E[Z_2],…) with E[Z_j] as I gave
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:46:43] I mean that would make no sense... law of large numbers says E[Z] = lim_N (1/N) sum_j^N Z_j
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:48:09] hm
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:48:17] nejimban: couldn't we just iterate LLN and see my result?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:48:34] there is a difference with Z = (Z_1,Z_2,…) and Z = lim Z_j
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:48:38] which is it?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:49:19] nejimban: could you clarify the difference?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:49:58] the first is a sequence of random variables, the second is just one random variable
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:51:13] nejimban: when you compute the expectation of X_j, which def do you use?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:51:48] i think it should be Z = (Z_1, ...)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:53:35] I don't understand what you mean
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:53:54] E[Z_j] = (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) tends to ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) as j \to ∞
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:54:12] so you get the value of E[Z] you wrote
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:56:15] ok, so by taking the E of each Z_j as a function of X_j' and then the E of E[Z_j]
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:57:42] yes one needs to distinguish the cases X_j ≠ X_j' and X_j = X_j'
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:57:58] because the laws of (X_j,X_j') differ
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:58:06] a
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[12:58:51] (but as j->infinity the case X_j = X_j' becomes negligible)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[12:59:01] I see
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[13:03:14] nejimban: thanks, that was useful
2021-07-20 10:40:40	biberao	[13:33:06] hi
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Neologik	[13:36:21] how do you traverse an infinite?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Z-module	[14:01:06] cherim__: : pretty sure the famous recently-solved thing that qergle referred to was for general exponents > 1, not just 2 and 3. Recent is 19 years ago.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture
2021-07-20 10:40:40	taeaad	[16:07:13] What is that theorem that says in constructive mathematics all functions are continuous?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[16:08:00] brower continuity theorem
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[16:08:03] brouwer
2021-07-20 10:40:40	taeaad	[16:10:13] riv: Thanks!
2021-07-20 10:40:40	taeaad	[16:10:59] I remember the lecturer going through the whole thing step by step. I was more surprised by the lecturer's thoroughness than I was disappointed in myself for not being able to follow everything.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[16:11:15] oh i haven't seen an actual proof of it
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Donitz	[16:12:35] I have a circle with radius r. position 0,0 is at 0 degrees at the edge of the circle
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Donitz	[16:12:46] how can I figure out what angle was used to get to position x,y
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Donitz	[16:13:59] angle less than 90 degrees
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Donitz	[16:14:42] oh wait. I think I just figured it out
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Donitz	[16:15:41] asin(y)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Donitz	[16:16:36] umm... asin(y / radius)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Dotz0cat	[16:21:12] Say I have 2 functions. How would I combine them to get a position vector?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Z-module	[16:21:55] functions from what to what?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	buster	[16:23:33] Donitz, atan(y/x), or atan2(y,x) if you allow yourself that luxury
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Donitz	[16:23:57] works too, but when under 90 degrees I think asin works just as well
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Donitz	[16:24:07] otherwise obviously it can go back down again
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Dotz0cat	[16:32:20] 2 functions because there is a plus or minus in them. I would like to get them to a vector form. A single vector so I don't have to work with 2 functions
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Z-module	[16:33:34] atan(y/x) is a crock
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Z-module	[16:33:40] atan2() is the only sane way
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tusko	[17:11:45] use the substitution u = y/x
2021-07-20 10:40:40	paulo_	[17:40:53] good morning
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:10:13] is time real ?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:10:18] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[18:13:49] yes time is real
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tusko	[18:16:21] no
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tusko	[18:16:29] time is relative
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[18:17:11] how does that make it not real
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tusko	[18:20:49] Well, it just doesn't really exist.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tusko	[18:21:17] It requires a reference point, and even then it is not fixed but constantly evolving.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:22:29] why is there a direction of time ?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:22:48] when the reference points are in space ?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:23:11] so how can it be opposing directional ?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:23:35] let the other directions aside.....
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[18:25:27] tusko, you are wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[18:26:03] Inline, that's a hard question but in terms of physics - even though many physical laws are reversible, entropy isn't
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tusko	[18:27:15] If a rainbow, sprinkle colored unicorn exploded atthe center of the earth, what time did it happen?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[18:27:38] absolute nonsense
2021-07-20 10:40:40	int-e	[18:27:41] this may be wandering too far
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:28:19] ok

2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:56:18] so if i used a non homogeneous clock time would be non equally distributed
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:59:04] deez clocks are all out of fashion
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Inline	[18:59:12] i don't feel no time pressure at all!

2021-07-20 10:40:40	Dotz0cat	[19:30:13] Say what would I get if I integrated an gradient?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tusko	[19:37:59] wouldn't that return the function by the fundamental theorem of calculus?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	somiaj	[19:39:37] What does it mean to 'integrate a vector'?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rex	[19:42:58] biberao: can you read me?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	kmh	[19:43:06] indeed
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rex	[19:43:27] somiaj: that depends; in what context are you asking
2021-07-20 10:40:40	kmh	[19:43:59] Dotz0cat,'s question i presume
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rex	[19:44:23] I see
2021-07-20 10:40:40	biberao	[19:45:40] rex: yes

2021-07-20 10:40:40	somiaj	[19:47:32] rex: the question was for Dotz0cat who asked about integrating an gardient.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	rex	[19:48:37] ok thx :)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[20:45:05] nejimban: ping, have a follow up q
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[21:00:20] Capso: here
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Guest78	[21:06:14] hello
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Guest78	[21:06:17] 1+1 = ?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[21:15:29] 2
2021-07-20 10:40:40	seL4	[21:24:40] can you determine the probability of the decidability of a program written for a turing machine?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[21:26:57] i th ink you can approximate it
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[21:27:01] if you weight small programs more
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[21:27:08] but it will be uncomputable
2021-07-20 10:40:40	seL4	[21:29:25] why is the probability uncomputable?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[21:30:50] well the program may be nontrivial e.g. may have an interpreter for a programming language in it
2021-07-20 10:40:40	PinealGlandOptic	[21:31:07] Hi all. What software packages do you know for solving integer linear problems? Wolfram, SymPy, what else?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[21:31:25] nejimban: hey
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[21:33:19] so you can't compute the probability by computing whether it halts on not on each input and adding it up. We actually need to argue conversely, if you could compute the probability exactly that would help you check halting.. but that isn't clear
2021-07-20 10:40:40	PinealGlandOptic	[21:34:03] There was ##math-software on Freenode. Seems not migrated?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[21:40:24] nejimban: Previously we saw that the Z_j = sum_{j'} k(x,X_j') k(X_j', X_j) have expectation given by int k(x,y) int k(y,y') dP(y') dP(y). Say Z_j = k^(2), the exponent denoting the iteration level and suppose we have a convergent Taylor series f(z) = sum_m c_m z^m. Then, does it follow that if we replace z^m with k^(m)_j then the Taylor series has expectation given by the Taylor series with the z^k replaced

2021-07-20 10:40:40	seL4	[21:41:19] thanks riv
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[21:42:01] so I can't say 100% its uncomputable
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[21:42:01] Capso: not sure I understood all that :D
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[21:42:32] nejimban: hang on, I'll mathbin
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Dotz0cat	[21:48:09] I am probably not gonna do anything on this today. I have a polar function of theta and r. What would I need to go through to find a PDE with the polar function as a solution?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	seL4	[22:08:37] does the approximation of the probability of the decidability of a program run on a turing machine depend on the number of states of the turing machine?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	seL4	[22:09:14] or I mean, does the approximation of the probability decrease as the number of states of the turing machine increases?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Panther	[22:10:11] https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/07/11/self-cleaning-turing-machine.html
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Panther	[22:10:46] That doesn't answer the question, but coincidentally, I was just looking at that.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[22:13:40] seL4, btw
2021-07-20 10:40:40	riv	[22:13:51] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant related? maybe
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[22:16:17] nejimban: mathb.in/61120
2021-07-20 10:40:40	seL4	[22:17:00] so you can't approximate the probability?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[22:19:01] Capso: seems interesting (and plausible)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[22:19:12] I am going to bed soon though
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[22:20:07] did you make it work for polynomial f?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[22:20:36] (or, like, just m=3, say)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[22:21:39] if basic induction works I'm guessing one needs to show that the limits in m and N 'commute'
2021-07-20 10:40:40	dogbert2	[22:25:14] math fail - why estimating the weight of explosives in a containment vessel (instead of actually weighing it) is a very bad idea :)
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[22:27:11] nejimban: polynomials are ok because I can bruteforce triangle inequality them
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[22:28:16] nejimban: problem comes in going to infinitely many terms with an alternating series... I need a better convergence method
2021-07-20 10:40:40	seL4	[22:28:53] thanks, riv
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tolarz	[22:33:05] btw, there are universal turing machines with < 5 states
2021-07-20 10:40:40	tolarz	[22:33:21] oh seL4 left
2021-07-20 10:40:40	nejimban	[22:36:53] Capso: if k is bounded it should work too
2021-07-20 10:40:40	Capso	[22:41:40] nejimban: yea, let's say k is bdd, i forgot to include that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Capso	[22:42:34] nejimban: how would that work? say, just exp(-x) ... the limiting series is exponentially increasing
2021-07-20 10:40:41	nejimban	[22:49:54] Capso: you can bound k^(m) by ||k||^m to get normal convergence of ∑ cₘk⁽m)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	nejimban	[22:50:27] assuming the power series associated with c_m has infinite radius
2021-07-20 10:40:41	nejimban	[22:50:42] or at least ||k||
2021-07-20 10:40:41	nejimban	[22:51:36] this should allow to Fubinize sum and expectation
2021-07-20 10:40:41	nejimban	[22:52:17] I'm too tired to write the details
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Capso	[23:22:53] nejimban: normal convergence of whay, sorry? on this interface I can't parse the unicode

2021-07-20 10:40:41	loopspace	[00:38:53] Well, it wasted some time for me, since I learned about Ext from a different book, and was wondering if there was something else going on
2021-07-20 10:40:41	loopspace	[00:39:23] The one from the other day clearly didn't work
2021-07-20 10:40:41	loopspace	[00:41:13] That one did turn into an interesting exercise though, if one ignored the matrix part
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[00:41:50] fair
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[00:42:28] loopspace: if G is abelian I'd have thought Hom(Z,_) is basically an identity functor
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[00:42:57] and on non abelian G it'd be Z[Ab(G)] its abelianization

2021-07-20 10:40:41	Hash	[02:08:51] See, I always said space intrinsic geometry and that each point in empty space (in that geometry) carries information
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Hash	[02:09:10] Then holonomy was discovered (or invented)?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Hash	[02:09:35] Then I was like, hey I wasn't the only one who thought that, cool. What did they come up with
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Hash	[02:10:12] And same thing. Space has intrinsic geometry and the movement of matter in space has relational geometry
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Z-module	[02:14:09] paulo_: if m > 1, then  GCD(m, m+1) = 2.   But GCD(1,2) = GCD(0,1) = 1.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Z-module	[02:14:30] oh crap, it's always 1
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Z-module	[02:14:50] not sure what I was thinking
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Z-module	[02:15:00] oh, you said EVEN
2021-07-20 10:40:41	paulo_	[02:15:04] yeah, even
2021-07-20 10:40:41	paulo_	[02:15:14] gcd(2n,2n+2)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Z-module	[02:15:39] yes, that's always 2 (only one of those is a multiple of 4, and no odd prime can divide both)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	paulo_	[02:16:56] Z-module: thanks
2021-07-20 10:40:41	paulo_	[02:37:37] how do I prove that the only consecutive even numbers whose product is a cube is 2 & 4?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	somiaj	[02:43:05] 2 + 4 = 6 is a cube?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Z-module	[02:43:13] product
2021-07-20 10:40:41	somiaj	[02:43:18] grr, yea read that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	somiaj	[02:43:26] just read..
2021-07-20 10:40:41	dude12312414	[02:45:28] missed
2021-07-20 10:40:41	somiaj	[02:47:07] Well it is equivlant to show that n(n+1)/2 is only a cube if n=1, which intuitivy seems true since n and n+1 won't have enough common factors to be a cube.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	int-e	[02:47:19] it reduces to showing that the only integer solution of x^3 + 1 = 2y^3 is (x,y) = (1,1)...
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frelleck	[02:48:09] you are solving (n+1)(n-1) = x^3 where n +1 and n - 1 are odd
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frelleck	[02:48:19] so they are relatively prive
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frelleck	[02:48:21] prime
2021-07-20 10:40:41	int-e	[02:48:26] (we may assume w.l.o.g. that n is odd (we can switch to -n-1 otherwise), and let n = x^3)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frelleck	[02:48:28] hence both cubes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frelleck	[02:48:42] i.e n+1 and n -1 are cubes that differ by 2
2021-07-20 10:40:41	int-e	[02:49:13] frelleck: you dropped the factor 2
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frelleck	[02:49:17] oops
2021-07-20 10:40:41	 *	frelleck [02:49:34] looks around for a 2
2021-07-20 10:40:41	paulo___	[02:50:45] got disconnected
2021-07-20 10:40:41	somiaj	[02:51:24] You missed a few suggestions, I noted that it is equivlant to showing that n(n+1)/2 is a cube iff n=1.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	paulo_	[02:51:32] sad, IP revealed
2021-07-20 10:40:41	paulo_	[02:51:49] last message I saw:  frelleck looks around for a 2
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frelleck	[02:52:01] that's the last one
2021-07-20 10:40:41	somiaj	[02:52:06] then you didn't miss much
2021-07-20 10:40:41	int-e	[02:55:01] oh there are the silly -2 * 0 = 0 * 2 = 0, of course.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	somiaj	[02:56:36] well 0*2 = 0 could be considered a cube.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Z-module	[02:58:02] So you need n, n+1 where n > 1, one of n, n+1 is an odd cube j^3, and other other is 2^a times an odd cube k^3 with j coprime to k.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Z-module	[02:59:14] and such that  2 + a  is a multiple of 3
2021-07-20 10:40:41	paulo___	[03:44:37] thanks
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[04:42:04] How did people make angular scales before ramsdens machine?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[04:43:52] I read somewhere some craftsmen still basically just used a fixed arc length to cut off the circle
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[04:43:58] How true is that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[04:46:33] ie with a caliper or such set to the arc length
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:52:30] loopspace: do you know how people say reading 'french math' is not hard, even if you dont know french
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:53:08] can you do that? (how do people do that? been trying to read this text, with help of google translate "addon" or w/e widget in chrome.. its slow and annoying)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:53:21] I tried looking for an alternative source, I can't find it either...
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[04:53:44] Fangs, french is supposed to be not too hard for english speakers
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:54:32] grammar and sentence structure is similar, supposedly. so "word by word" translation should get you most of the way
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[04:55:35] Fangs, vocabulary also has a lot in common: English has borrowed a lot from French
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:55:35] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BxtLWcMM/Screenshot%20(83).png
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[04:55:49] You'd be surprised, very common words like 'purchase' are actually french
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:56:08] I can see "graduation" <-> "grading" etc
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:56:28] pikapika: just feels a bit uneasy having to "guess" what the text meant
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:56:45] (esp with maths where precision is necessary)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[04:56:47] Fangs, thats actually quite fun to do...at least with a non-technical work
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:57:46] pikapika: this guy's computation is based on objects defined here
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:57:59] and his paper does have an 'appendix' attempting to re-explain everything
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[04:58:12] but I think I'm still forced to read this french source
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Fangs	[05:00:48] wonder if I can go to fiver or something and just commsion someone to translate these for $5

2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[03:04:50] just use the discrete measure on an uncountable set
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[03:05:02] I don't know how natural that is but it's an easy example
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:05:15] i think i might be asking this question prematurely; maybe i should get comfortable with different examples of measures before thinking about it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Galois	[03:06:33] you can also take the borel/lebesgue measure on the long line
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:06:58] its kind of cool that any countably additive function on an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the sigma algebra generated by that algebra; that seems like a strong statement to make
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:07:18] i cant wait for the appendix to hit me with a 5 page proof
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[03:07:30] it's pretty icky iirc
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[03:07:33] uses outer measures
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:08:45] it is in fact a 5 page proof
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:08:50] and does in fact use outer measures
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[03:09:43] short but icky I guess
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:10:10] i guess short depends on how many assumptions you take for granted or include as part of the proof heh
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:10:15] lemmas, i mean
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:11:13] cauchy's integral theorem is trivial if you just use green's theorem :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	mefistofeles	[03:11:48] green's theorem tastes better with a bagel, btw
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:11:54] ;)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:12:18] this does make me want to learn some measure theory before going further, since it seems like there's a lot of development im taking for granted
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:12:24] probably a rabbit hole though, ill come back to it later lol
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:17:33] WOAH
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:17:51] i remember my analysis text giving a first glance at the cosntruction of lebesgue measure
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:18:21] but this book just hits you with the "it's the unique measure obtained by extending the countably additive "length" function on unions of intervals"
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:18:24] woaaaaah
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Galois	[03:19:23] I think that theorem is at https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/measure_theory/outer_measure.lean#L961
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Galois	[03:20:14] and yes, lean uses what you just said: def lebesgue_outer : outer_measure ℝ := outer_measure.of_function lebesgue_length lebesgue_length_empty
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:20:59] yeah my text calls it caratheodory's extension theorem
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[03:21:16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem
2021-07-20 11:28:45	darwin	[05:01:48] who was the guy who recited pi for 80 days?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	darwin	[05:48:33] i saw a UK billboard sign "Football: It's Our Religion" (football in most the world, but in USA a.k.a. soccer) so I want to see a billboard sign with people in ancient/Classical Greek clothes "Mathematics: It's Our Religion"
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[06:14:38] people in antiquity used to sometimes kill each other over math disputes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	astronaut	[06:22:02] pascal lost an eye in a math dispute
2021-07-20 11:28:45	astronaut	[06:22:08] or was it cardano?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[06:34:58] i dont think it was pascal
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[06:55:09] there are uncountably many strictly increasing maps from N to N, right
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[06:56:01] since, given such a function f, for any n in the domain of f, there are countably many choices for f, even when considering the increasing constraint
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[06:56:59] yeah that's obvious; man i feel so rusty already
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lieven	[07:00:14] one way of easily seeing this is noting that each such function is uniquely described by its increment at each point of N
2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[07:01:46] that's a nice way of looking at it, yeah
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lieven	[07:02:35] well, its increments and its starting value of course
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[07:03:43] huh, x^2+x+1 | x^4n - x^n
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[07:03:45] thats crazy
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[07:03:59] There are even uncountably many that just increase by 1 or 2 at each step.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[07:05:58] (x-1)(x^2+x+1) = x^3 - 1, x^(4n) - x^n = x^n (x^(3n) - 1), and x^3-1 divides x^(3n) - 1.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[07:06:10] nice!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	alphamul2	[07:13:24] Hmm, wasn't there a school that got burned down because they wouldn't let this one guy go to it, that then spread the teachings across the continent because of fleeing students?  XD
2021-07-20 11:28:45	alphamul2	[07:13:48] Man, that was Greece, wasn't it?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[08:20:16] how do I prove that x^2 - y^3 = 1 has no integer solutions?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[08:26:10] that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[08:27:24] anyways x=3, y=2 solves. you probably mean no other than that.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[08:32:21] what about the special case: y can't be odd
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[08:32:47] x=3,y=2 is the only solution
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[08:33:07] yeah, I'm trying to prove that y can't be odd
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[08:35:56] x^2 - 1 = y^3 <=> (x+1)(x-1) = y^3
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[08:40:17] assuming y is odd, then x+1 and x-1 are consecutive odd numbers. so x+1 and x-1 are coprime
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[08:40:45] this also implies that x+1 and x-1 are cubes. but this is impossible since there are not 2-apart cubes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cherim__	[08:40:54] "that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time" -- what?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cherim__	[08:41:07] Mixing with 3^x-2^y=1?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[08:41:35] we arrive at a contradiction, so y can't be odd
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[08:41:40] is my proof correct?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[08:53:11] n!/n1!*n2!*..*nk!    gives me the total permutations of a set of n objects, with k "kinds" of these objects, right?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[08:54:51] yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[08:55:02] rendar ^
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[08:55:25] now my question is:
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[08:55:33] n1+n2+...+nk must be = n ?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[08:55:39] yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[08:55:55] otherwise if it's different than n, what am i getting?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[08:56:10] nᵢ is the number of objects of type i. the sum over the types must be the total amount.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[08:56:55] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem#Number_of_unique_permutations_of_words
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:02:23] yeah
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:02:49] but if i specify a number different than n, i'm not getting permutations, but some other result.. not related to permutations i guess
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cherim__	[09:05:55] Possibly not even integer, so not necessarily combinatorially interpretable
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cherim__	[09:07:35] If the sum is <=n, you can assume it's padded with 1!1!..1! though
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cherim__	[09:07:51] With a clear combinatorial meaning
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:09:05] if the sum is ≤ n it's not a padding issue at all. what's happened is you've not counted all the "kinds".
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:09:24] or it's a mispecified problem
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:09:37] at that point it's no longer math but sorcery to determine what is happening.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:14:40] qergle: but if i have a set of 10 objects, 7 of a kind, 1 of a kind, 1 of a kind and 1 of a kind, i'll get: 10!/7!1!1!1! = 10!/7!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:14:42] right?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:15:00] yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:15:21] so it's not math sorcery, it's a real thing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:15:34] it's not
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:15:39] this still holds: <rendar> n1+n2+...+nk must be = n
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:15:44] 7+1+1+1=10
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:15:53] yeah
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:16:07] ok bbl.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:16:14] so cherim__ was right that if we have <n we can consider that with padding 1!1!1!..!1
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:16:29] if what is <n?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:17:11] n1+n2+...+nk < n
2021-07-20 11:28:45	qergle	[09:17:18] you don't have that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:17:53] ok
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:39:15] if i have 10 sports game and 5 arcade games, if i pick 5 games, how many ways are there that i get 3 arcade games and 2 sports game? nCr(10,3)*nCr(5,2) = 120*10 = 1200
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:39:20] this is correct, right?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:40:38] i can't get why the book uses nCr operation 2 times
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[09:44:55] rendar: C(10,3) * C(5,2) is correct, but what is the question?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:45:28] int-e: my calculator calls that C() operation nCr
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[09:45:40] that's fine, I'm too lazy to type that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[09:46:02] and I don't like the look of 10C3 * 5C2 (which is the notation that that nCr derives from)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:46:50] right
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:47:05] int-e: my question is: why i have to use C() 2 times?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[09:47:43] rendar: Because you're selecting 3 aracde games (that's one C) and 2 sports games (that's the other one)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:48:35] sorry, i misread the excersise!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[09:48:43] yeah, it's clear now
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:51:07] Hi all, a question
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:51:56] I want to understand better how to determine whether an assumption in a set of assumptions is REQUIRED for a proof or is superfluous to the probelm at hand
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:52:25] e.g.  x = 5 & y = 6 & z = 7, therefore x + y = 11 (z is completely unrelated)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:52:40] But not just for this simple example, but more generally to all proofs
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:52:50] Can anybody point me in the right direction?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lieven	[09:55:16] you can try to find counterexamples to theorems if you leave out one of the assumptions
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[09:55:51] lisp123: well, an assumption is superfluous if there's a proof not using the assumption. so identifying required assumptions seems more useful, and you can do that by finding counterexamples to the theorem without the assumption in question
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[09:56:32] (note that required assumptions may still be stronger than necessary)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lieven	[09:57:11] in a more advanced way there's the field of reverse mathematics that works out to what extent theorems have equivalent logical power to their assumptions. Stillwell wrote a fairly accessible account on it.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:58:12] thanks int-e & lieven
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:58:53] I'm trying to find a way of identifying superfluous conditions without prior knowledge of the required assumptions
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:59:14] lieven: thanks for this reverse mathematics lead, I will look into Stillwell now
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[09:59:58] One thing I was thinking, was that if the result of a theorem is expressed in certain variables, e.g. x & y, then checking all the input assumptions - one could disregard any assumption that has no relation AT ALL to the variables used in the result?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[10:00:52] heh, even if a theorem is equivalent to its assumptions, the assumptions may be redundant.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[10:02:16] int-e: thanks, i agree. However would my approach at least strip out some basic assumptions (i.e. some but not all), or would you know if it could be flawed in the sense that some assumptions are incorrectly kicked out?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[10:02:20] s/a theorem/a theorem's conclusion/
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[10:13:00] lieven: if your assumption is never used in the proof, then it is superfluous (to the proof, and hence the result)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[10:13:06] oh they left
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[10:14:16] their question had two levels to it. whether something is not needed for the proof, or whether something is not needed for the result. if its not needed for the proof, obv its not needed for the result. if its not needed for the result, it could still be needed for that particular proof
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[10:14:58] the 1st seems fairly easy enough, the latter is hard.. their last line seems to indicate they are interested in the former
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[10:29:18] how many permutations the letters of the word COLUMNS? 7!  -- how many of them starts with letter 'C' ? (7-1)! ?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[10:36:47] yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[10:38:57] rendar: do you understand why?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rendar	[10:39:05] yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lisp123	[10:39:15] cool :-)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lieven	[12:07:07] there's a famous result in number theory where the proof goes as follows: assume the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows. Assume the negation of the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:07:18] If X_j are random variables on R^n with law P and g is a function on R^n, then we know the expectation of Y_j = g(X_j) is int g(x) dP(x). But what about the expectaion of a sum, Z_j = (1/j) sum_k=1^j X_j? is it the anticipated double integral?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	lieven	[12:07:24] intuitively one feels there should be a proof not mentioning RH
2021-07-20 11:28:45	mornfall	[12:10:10] lieven: would you say that any proof with case analysis should intuitively exist in a version without case analysis?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:10:28] Capso: more or less the same formula but with P being the law of the vector (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:11:23] ∫ g((x1+···+xj)/j) dP(x1,…,xj)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:13:43] oops, I need another variable: if k is a function on R^2n and we define, Z_j = (1/j) sum^j k(x,X_k) k(X_j, X_k)? what is E[Z]?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:15:33] nejimban: sorry, i boofed the original Q. how about this corrected Z_j? I would anticipate a double integral, but I've not seen it stated
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:16:07] what is x there?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:17:00] a fixed point, indeoendent of samples
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:17:11] I'm assuming X_j are iid
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:17:24] assuming k measurable, Z_j is a measurable function of (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:20:37] is j the summing variable?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:21:08] Capso: or you are summing from k=1 up to j
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:21:17] nejimban: the latter
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:21:51] so if the X_k are iid then E[Z] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:23:01] nejimban: how do we get a j in the expectation of Z?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:23:33] sorry it's Z_j not Z
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:24:20] (isn't Z=Z_j? what's Z otherwise?)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:25:14] I don't understand how the expectation of an rv can depend on j
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:26:22] j seems fixed here
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:26:30] nejimban: if X_j are iid then their expectation is int x dP(x) do you agree?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:26:41] you don't need iid
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:26:54] if X_j has law P then E[X_j] = ∫ xdP(x) yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:27:15] nejimban: now I'm defining a new rv, Z_j as above and I want its expectation
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:27:58] I just gave it to you
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:28:16] E[Z_j] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:28:37] I dont see how there can be a dependence on j?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:28:43] because Z_j depends on j?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:29:07] I might have not parsed your math correctly, could you use e.g. mathb.in?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:39:58] nejimban: mathb.in/61088
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:41:42] nejimban: there should be a (1/j) factor in the def of Z_j, but hopefully you get the idea now
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:43:16] Capso: my computation simplifies to (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:43:27] but I don't agree with the anticipated result you wrote
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:43:53] because the last summand of that sum is k(p, X_j)k(X_j,X_j)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:44:46] ok, i could be wrong, but do you agree that E[Z] can't depend on j?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:45:01] ah, wait, Z is the limit of Z_j?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:45:19] ah no I see
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:45:38] I hadn't got the def of Z, sorry
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:45:58] so yeah, E[Z] does not depend on j
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:46:19] it's (E[Z_1],E[Z_2],…) with E[Z_j] as I gave
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:46:43] I mean that would make no sense... law of large numbers says E[Z] = lim_N (1/N) sum_j^N Z_j
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:48:09] hm
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:48:17] nejimban: couldn't we just iterate LLN and see my result?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:48:34] there is a difference with Z = (Z_1,Z_2,…) and Z = lim Z_j
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:48:38] which is it?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:49:19] nejimban: could you clarify the difference?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:49:58] the first is a sequence of random variables, the second is just one random variable
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:51:13] nejimban: when you compute the expectation of X_j, which def do you use?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:51:48] i think it should be Z = (Z_1, ...)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:53:35] I don't understand what you mean
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:53:54] E[Z_j] = (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) tends to ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) as j \to ∞
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:54:12] so you get the value of E[Z] you wrote
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:56:15] ok, so by taking the E of each Z_j as a function of X_j' and then the E of E[Z_j]
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:57:42] yes one needs to distinguish the cases X_j ≠ X_j' and X_j = X_j'
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:57:58] because the laws of (X_j,X_j') differ
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:58:06] a
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[12:58:51] (but as j->infinity the case X_j = X_j' becomes negligible)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[12:59:01] I see
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[13:03:14] nejimban: thanks, that was useful
2021-07-20 11:28:45	biberao	[13:33:06] hi
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Neologik	[13:36:21] how do you traverse an infinite?

2021-07-20 11:28:45	taeaad	[16:07:13] What is that theorem that says in constructive mathematics all functions are continuous?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[16:08:00] brower continuity theorem
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[16:08:03] brouwer
2021-07-20 11:28:45	taeaad	[16:10:13] riv: Thanks!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	taeaad	[16:10:59] I remember the lecturer going through the whole thing step by step. I was more surprised by the lecturer's thoroughness than I was disappointed in myself for not being able to follow everything.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[16:11:15] oh i haven't seen an actual proof of it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Donitz	[16:12:35] I have a circle with radius r. position 0,0 is at 0 degrees at the edge of the circle
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Donitz	[16:12:46] how can I figure out what angle was used to get to position x,y
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Donitz	[16:13:59] angle less than 90 degrees
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Donitz	[16:14:42] oh wait. I think I just figured it out
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Donitz	[16:15:41] asin(y)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Donitz	[16:16:36] umm... asin(y / radius)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Dotz0cat	[16:21:12] Say I have 2 functions. How would I combine them to get a position vector?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[16:21:55] functions from what to what?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	buster	[16:23:33] Donitz, atan(y/x), or atan2(y,x) if you allow yourself that luxury
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Donitz	[16:23:57] works too, but when under 90 degrees I think asin works just as well
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Donitz	[16:24:07] otherwise obviously it can go back down again
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Dotz0cat	[16:32:20] 2 functions because there is a plus or minus in them. I would like to get them to a vector form. A single vector so I don't have to work with 2 functions
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[16:33:34] atan(y/x) is a crock
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[16:33:40] atan2() is the only sane way
2021-07-20 11:28:45	tusko	[17:11:45] use the substitution u = y/x

2021-07-20 11:28:45	tusko	[18:16:29] time is relative
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[18:17:11] how does that make it not real
2021-07-20 11:28:45	tusko	[18:20:49] Well, it just doesn't really exist.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	tusko	[18:21:17] It requires a reference point, and even then it is not fixed but constantly evolving.

2021-07-20 11:28:45	somiaj	[19:39:37] What does it mean to 'integrate a vector'?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rex	[19:42:58] biberao: can you read me?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	kmh	[19:43:06] indeed
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rex	[19:43:27] somiaj: that depends; in what context are you asking
2021-07-20 11:28:45	kmh	[19:43:59] Dotz0cat,'s question i presume
2021-07-20 11:28:45	rex	[19:44:23] I see

2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[20:45:05] nejimban: ping, have a follow up q
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[21:00:20] Capso: here
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Guest78	[21:06:14] hello
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Guest78	[21:06:17] 1+1 = ?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[21:15:29] 2
2021-07-20 11:28:45	seL4	[21:24:40] can you determine the probability of the decidability of a program written for a turing machine?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[21:26:57] i th ink you can approximate it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[21:27:01] if you weight small programs more
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[21:27:08] but it will be uncomputable
2021-07-20 11:28:45	seL4	[21:29:25] why is the probability uncomputable?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[21:30:50] well the program may be nontrivial e.g. may have an interpreter for a programming language in it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PinealGlandOptic	[21:31:07] Hi all. What software packages do you know for solving integer linear problems? Wolfram, SymPy, what else?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[21:31:25] nejimban: hey
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[21:33:19] so you can't compute the probability by computing whether it halts on not on each input and adding it up. We actually need to argue conversely, if you could compute the probability exactly that would help you check halting.. but that isn't clear
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PinealGlandOptic	[21:34:03] There was ##math-software on Freenode. Seems not migrated?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[21:40:24] nejimban: Previously we saw that the Z_j = sum_{j'} k(x,X_j') k(X_j', X_j) have expectation given by int k(x,y) int k(y,y') dP(y') dP(y). Say Z_j = k^(2), the exponent denoting the iteration level and suppose we have a convergent Taylor series f(z) = sum_m c_m z^m. Then, does it follow that if we replace z^m with k^(m)_j then the Taylor series has expectation given by the Taylor series with the z^k replaced
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[21:40:30] with iterated integrals?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	seL4	[21:41:19] thanks riv
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[21:42:01] so I can't say 100% its uncomputable
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[21:42:01] Capso: not sure I understood all that :D
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[21:42:32] nejimban: hang on, I'll mathbin
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Dotz0cat	[21:48:09] I am probably not gonna do anything on this today. I have a polar function of theta and r. What would I need to go through to find a PDE with the polar function as a solution?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	seL4	[22:08:37] does the approximation of the probability of the decidability of a program run on a turing machine depend on the number of states of the turing machine?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	seL4	[22:09:14] or I mean, does the approximation of the probability decrease as the number of states of the turing machine increases?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Panther	[22:10:11] https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/07/11/self-cleaning-turing-machine.html
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Panther	[22:10:46] That doesn't answer the question, but coincidentally, I was just looking at that.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[22:13:40] seL4, btw
2021-07-20 11:28:45	riv	[22:13:51] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant related? maybe
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[22:16:17] nejimban: mathb.in/61120
2021-07-20 11:28:45	seL4	[22:17:00] so you can't approximate the probability?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:19:01] Capso: seems interesting (and plausible)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:19:12] I am going to bed soon though
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:20:07] did you make it work for polynomial f?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:20:36] (or, like, just m=3, say)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:21:39] if basic induction works I'm guessing one needs to show that the limits in m and N 'commute'
2021-07-20 11:28:45	dogbert2	[22:25:14] math fail - why estimating the weight of explosives in a containment vessel (instead of actually weighing it) is a very bad idea :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[22:27:11] nejimban: polynomials are ok because I can bruteforce triangle inequality them
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[22:28:16] nejimban: problem comes in going to infinitely many terms with an alternating series... I need a better convergence method
2021-07-20 11:28:45	seL4	[22:28:53] thanks, riv
2021-07-20 11:28:45	tolarz	[22:33:05] btw, there are universal turing machines with < 5 states
2021-07-20 11:28:45	tolarz	[22:33:21] oh seL4 left
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:36:53] Capso: if k is bounded it should work too
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[22:41:40] nejimban: yea, let's say k is bdd, i forgot to include that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[22:42:34] nejimban: how would that work? say, just exp(-x) ... the limiting series is exponentially increasing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:49:54] Capso: you can bound k^(m) by ||k||^m to get normal convergence of ∑ cₘk⁽m)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:50:27] assuming the power series associated with c_m has infinite radius
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:50:42] or at least ||k||
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:51:36] this should allow to Fubinize sum and expectation
2021-07-20 11:28:45	nejimban	[22:52:17] I'm too tired to write the details
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Capso	[23:22:53] nejimban: normal convergence of whay, sorry? on this interface I can't parse the unicode

2021-07-20 11:28:45	mouseghost	[23:23:40] or maybe \sum c_m k^m

2021-07-20 11:28:45	greenbagels	[00:30:42] why is measure theory considered dry? seems like the results are pretty deep / powerful?

2021-07-20 11:28:45	loopspace	[00:41:13] That one did turn into an interesting exercise though, if one ignored the matrix part

2021-07-20 11:28:45	zacts	[01:54:44] I'm starting with this text on analysis at the moment however
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:57:25] I didn't go to school for math.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:57:31] It is a hobby
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa	[01:57:58] math is a necessary evil
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:58:03] So I am not fully 100% familiar with everything they talk about in holonomy mathematics of differential geometry and things
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:58:45] And here's a fun question.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:59:08] Why do humans see fractal mathematical patterns in hallucinations, especially those induced by potent psychedelics
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:59:27] What's that all about?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa	[01:59:41] many things are build like that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:59:50] We're jsut build like that?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:59:55] To hallucinate geometry?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[01:59:59] That's intriguing.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa	[02:00:03] it's all around us
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:00:10] Why do you start with that, that we're built like that?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa	[02:00:32] look at the trees for example, you're see it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa	[02:00:40] you'll*
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:00:54] Press your eyeballs with thumbs when closed, and then watch how each eye radiates out light and they cause interference pattern
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:00:56] it's peculiar.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:01:14] Open your eyes, and it goes away
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa	[02:01:47] yeah, uselles phenomena
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:01:50] Tree rings, finger prints, cosmic large scale structures and neural connections
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:02:15] Makes you wonder, what is math?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:02:24] I mean. We have our definitions of it, various ones.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:02:44] But really, what the bloody heck is it and why does nature, is nature, about,... how.. why is it there?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:03:44] Makes you wonder
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:04:20] Is there a mathematical framework to 'thought'? Since thought is nothing more than electrons moving from one place to another in the brain, and the brain has a structure.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa_	[02:05:02] i guess it was discovered
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:05:13] Right
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:05:16] Dis + covered
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:05:28] It was covered, but we uncovered/dis-covered it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:05:45] So it was always there. Why? Why is mathematics required?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa_	[02:05:53] maybe it's just a human thing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	stipa	[02:06:33] it's here, it's of use to us and that's it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[02:06:56] hi
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[02:07:27] if the gcd of consecutive even numbers always 2?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:08:51] See, I always said space intrinsic geometry and that each point in empty space (in that geometry) carries information
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:09:10] Then holonomy was discovered (or invented)?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:09:35] Then I was like, hey I wasn't the only one who thought that, cool. What did they come up with
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Hash	[02:10:12] And same thing. Space has intrinsic geometry and the movement of matter in space has relational geometry
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[02:14:09] paulo_: if m > 1, then  GCD(m, m+1) = 2.   But GCD(1,2) = GCD(0,1) = 1.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[02:14:30] oh crap, it's always 1
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[02:14:50] not sure what I was thinking
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[02:15:00] oh, you said EVEN
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[02:15:04] yeah, even
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[02:15:14] gcd(2n,2n+2)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[02:15:39] yes, that's always 2 (only one of those is a multiple of 4, and no odd prime can divide both)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[02:16:56] Z-module: thanks
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[02:37:37] how do I prove that the only consecutive even numbers whose product is a cube is 2 & 4?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	somiaj	[02:43:05] 2 + 4 = 6 is a cube?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[02:43:13] product
2021-07-20 11:28:45	somiaj	[02:43:18] grr, yea read that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	somiaj	[02:43:26] just read..
2021-07-20 11:28:45	dude12312414	[02:45:28] missed
2021-07-20 11:28:45	somiaj	[02:47:07] Well it is equivlant to show that n(n+1)/2 is only a cube if n=1, which intuitivy seems true since n and n+1 won't have enough common factors to be a cube.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[02:47:19] it reduces to showing that the only integer solution of x^3 + 1 = 2y^3 is (x,y) = (1,1)...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[02:48:09] you are solving (n+1)(n-1) = x^3 where n +1 and n - 1 are odd
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[02:48:19] so they are relatively prive
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[02:48:21] prime
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[02:48:26] (we may assume w.l.o.g. that n is odd (we can switch to -n-1 otherwise), and let n = x^3)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[02:48:28] hence both cubes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[02:48:42] i.e n+1 and n -1 are cubes that differ by 2
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[02:49:13] frelleck: you dropped the factor 2
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[02:49:17] oops
2021-07-20 11:28:45	 *	frelleck [02:49:34] looks around for a 2
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo___	[02:50:45] got disconnected
2021-07-20 11:28:45	somiaj	[02:51:24] You missed a few suggestions, I noted that it is equivlant to showing that n(n+1)/2 is a cube iff n=1.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[02:51:32] sad, IP revealed
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo_	[02:51:49] last message I saw:  frelleck looks around for a 2
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frelleck	[02:52:01] that's the last one
2021-07-20 11:28:45	somiaj	[02:52:06] then you didn't miss much
2021-07-20 11:28:45	int-e	[02:55:01] oh there are the silly -2 * 0 = 0 * 2 = 0, of course.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	somiaj	[02:56:36] well 0*2 = 0 could be considered a cube.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[02:58:02] So you need n, n+1 where n > 1, one of n, n+1 is an odd cube j^3, and other other is 2^a times an odd cube k^3 with j coprime to k.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Z-module	[02:59:14] and such that  2 + a  is a multiple of 3
2021-07-20 11:28:45	paulo___	[03:44:37] thanks
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[04:42:04] How did people make angular scales before ramsdens machine?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[04:43:52] I read somewhere some craftsmen still basically just used a fixed arc length to cut off the circle
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[04:43:58] How true is that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[04:46:33] ie with a caliper or such set to the arc length
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:52:30] loopspace: do you know how people say reading 'french math' is not hard, even if you dont know french
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:53:08] can you do that? (how do people do that? been trying to read this text, with help of google translate "addon" or w/e widget in chrome.. its slow and annoying)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:53:21] I tried looking for an alternative source, I can't find it either...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[04:53:44] Fangs, french is supposed to be not too hard for english speakers
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:54:32] grammar and sentence structure is similar, supposedly. so "word by word" translation should get you most of the way
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[04:55:35] Fangs, vocabulary also has a lot in common: English has borrowed a lot from French
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:55:35] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BxtLWcMM/Screenshot%20(83).png
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[04:55:49] You'd be surprised, very common words like 'purchase' are actually french
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:56:08] I can see "graduation" <-> "grading" etc
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:56:28] pikapika: just feels a bit uneasy having to "guess" what the text meant
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:56:45] (esp with maths where precision is necessary)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[04:56:47] Fangs, thats actually quite fun to do...at least with a non-technical work
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:57:46] pikapika: this guy's computation is based on objects defined here
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:57:59] and his paper does have an 'appendix' attempting to re-explain everything
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[04:58:12] but I think I'm still forced to read this french source
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[05:00:48] wonder if I can go to fiver or something and just commsion someone to translate these for $5
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[05:12:17] pikapika: ok yeah this is actually not so hard...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Fangs	[05:12:35] (damn I wish I just try reading these instead of finding another source)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[05:12:49] Did you find a bidder on fiver?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[05:13:14] Come on bro, french isn't that hard with the help of a dictionary and some google translate
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Matt|home	[05:57:07] quick question.. for order of operations does it matter if you do division/multiplication in either order as long as it's left to right

2021-07-20 11:28:59	frelleck	[03:04:50] just use the discrete measure on an uncountable set
2021-07-20 11:28:59	frelleck	[03:05:02] I don't know how natural that is but it's an easy example
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:05:15] i think i might be asking this question prematurely; maybe i should get comfortable with different examples of measures before thinking about it
2021-07-20 11:28:59	Galois	[03:06:33] you can also take the borel/lebesgue measure on the long line
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:06:58] its kind of cool that any countably additive function on an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the sigma algebra generated by that algebra; that seems like a strong statement to make
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:07:18] i cant wait for the appendix to hit me with a 5 page proof
2021-07-20 11:28:59	frelleck	[03:07:30] it's pretty icky iirc
2021-07-20 11:28:59	frelleck	[03:07:33] uses outer measures
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:08:45] it is in fact a 5 page proof
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:08:50] and does in fact use outer measures
2021-07-20 11:28:59	frelleck	[03:09:43] short but icky I guess
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:10:10] i guess short depends on how many assumptions you take for granted or include as part of the proof heh
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:10:15] lemmas, i mean
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:11:13] cauchy's integral theorem is trivial if you just use green's theorem :)
2021-07-20 11:28:59	mefistofeles	[03:11:48] green's theorem tastes better with a bagel, btw
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:11:54] ;)
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:12:18] this does make me want to learn some measure theory before going further, since it seems like there's a lot of development im taking for granted
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:12:24] probably a rabbit hole though, ill come back to it later lol
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:17:33] WOAH
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:17:51] i remember my analysis text giving a first glance at the cosntruction of lebesgue measure
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:18:21] but this book just hits you with the "it's the unique measure obtained by extending the countably additive "length" function on unions of intervals"
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:18:24] woaaaaah
2021-07-20 11:28:59	Galois	[03:19:23] I think that theorem is at https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/measure_theory/outer_measure.lean#L961
2021-07-20 11:28:59	Galois	[03:20:14] and yes, lean uses what you just said: def lebesgue_outer : outer_measure ℝ := outer_measure.of_function lebesgue_length lebesgue_length_empty
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:20:59] yeah my text calls it caratheodory's extension theorem
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[03:21:16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem
2021-07-20 11:28:59	darwin	[05:01:48] who was the guy who recited pi for 80 days?
2021-07-20 11:28:59	darwin	[05:48:33] i saw a UK billboard sign "Football: It's Our Religion" (football in most the world, but in USA a.k.a. soccer) so I want to see a billboard sign with people in ancient/Classical Greek clothes "Mathematics: It's Our Religion"
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[06:14:38] people in antiquity used to sometimes kill each other over math disputes
2021-07-20 11:28:59	astronaut	[06:22:02] pascal lost an eye in a math dispute
2021-07-20 11:28:59	astronaut	[06:22:08] or was it cardano?
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[06:34:58] i dont think it was pascal
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[06:55:09] there are uncountably many strictly increasing maps from N to N, right
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[06:56:01] since, given such a function f, for any n in the domain of f, there are countably many choices for f, even when considering the increasing constraint
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[06:56:59] yeah that's obvious; man i feel so rusty already
2021-07-20 11:28:59	lieven	[07:00:14] one way of easily seeing this is noting that each such function is uniquely described by its increment at each point of N
2021-07-20 11:28:59	greenbagels	[07:01:46] that's a nice way of looking at it, yeah
2021-07-20 11:28:59	lieven	[07:02:35] well, its increments and its starting value of course
2021-07-20 11:28:59	riv	[07:03:43] huh, x^2+x+1 | x^4n - x^n
2021-07-20 11:28:59	riv	[07:03:45] thats crazy
2021-07-20 11:28:59	PlanckWalk	[07:03:59] There are even uncountably many that just increase by 1 or 2 at each step.
2021-07-20 11:28:59	PlanckWalk	[07:05:58] (x-1)(x^2+x+1) = x^3 - 1, x^(4n) - x^n = x^n (x^(3n) - 1), and x^3-1 divides x^(3n) - 1.
2021-07-20 11:28:59	riv	[07:06:10] nice!
2021-07-20 11:28:59	alphamul2	[07:13:24] Hmm, wasn't there a school that got burned down because they wouldn't let this one guy go to it, that then spread the teachings across the continent because of fleeing students?  XD
2021-07-20 11:28:59	alphamul2	[07:13:48] Man, that was Greece, wasn't it?
2021-07-20 11:28:59	paulo_	[08:20:16] how do I prove that x^2 - y^3 = 1 has no integer solutions?
2021-07-20 11:28:59	qergle	[08:26:10] that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time
2021-07-20 11:28:59	qergle	[08:27:24] anyways x=3, y=2 solves. you probably mean no other than that.
2021-07-20 11:28:59	paulo_	[08:32:21] what about the special case: y can't be odd
2021-07-20 11:28:59	qergle	[08:32:47] x=3,y=2 is the only solution
2021-07-20 11:28:59	paulo_	[08:33:07] yeah, I'm trying to prove that y can't be odd
2021-07-20 11:28:59	paulo_	[08:35:56] x^2 - 1 = y^3 <=> (x+1)(x-1) = y^3
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[08:40:17] assuming y is odd, then x+1 and x-1 are consecutive odd numbers. so x+1 and x-1 are coprime
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[08:40:45] this also implies that x+1 and x-1 are cubes. but this is impossible since there are not 2-apart cubes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cherim__	[08:40:54] "that is a famous problem that was unproven for a long time" -- what?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cherim__	[08:41:07] Mixing with 3^x-2^y=1?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[08:41:35] we arrive at a contradiction, so y can't be odd
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[08:41:40] is my proof correct?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[08:53:11] n!/n1!*n2!*..*nk!    gives me the total permutations of a set of n objects, with k "kinds" of these objects, right?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[08:54:51] yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[08:55:02] rendar ^
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[08:55:25] now my question is:
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[08:55:33] n1+n2+...+nk must be = n ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[08:55:39] yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[08:55:55] otherwise if it's different than n, what am i getting?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[08:56:10] nᵢ is the number of objects of type i. the sum over the types must be the total amount.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[08:56:55] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem#Number_of_unique_permutations_of_words
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:02:23] yeah
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:02:49] but if i specify a number different than n, i'm not getting permutations, but some other result.. not related to permutations i guess
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cherim__	[09:05:55] Possibly not even integer, so not necessarily combinatorially interpretable
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cherim__	[09:07:35] If the sum is <=n, you can assume it's padded with 1!1!..1! though
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cherim__	[09:07:51] With a clear combinatorial meaning
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:09:05] if the sum is ≤ n it's not a padding issue at all. what's happened is you've not counted all the "kinds".
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:09:24] or it's a mispecified problem
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:09:37] at that point it's no longer math but sorcery to determine what is happening.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:14:40] qergle: but if i have a set of 10 objects, 7 of a kind, 1 of a kind, 1 of a kind and 1 of a kind, i'll get: 10!/7!1!1!1! = 10!/7!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:14:42] right?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:15:00] yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:15:21] so it's not math sorcery, it's a real thing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:15:34] it's not
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:15:39] this still holds: <rendar> n1+n2+...+nk must be = n
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:15:44] 7+1+1+1=10
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:15:53] yeah
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:16:07] ok bbl.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:16:14] so cherim__ was right that if we have <n we can consider that with padding 1!1!1!..!1
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:16:29] if what is <n?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:17:11] n1+n2+...+nk < n
2021-07-20 11:29:00	qergle	[09:17:18] you don't have that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:17:53] ok
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:39:15] if i have 10 sports game and 5 arcade games, if i pick 5 games, how many ways are there that i get 3 arcade games and 2 sports game? nCr(10,3)*nCr(5,2) = 120*10 = 1200
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:39:20] this is correct, right?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:40:38] i can't get why the book uses nCr operation 2 times
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[09:44:55] rendar: C(10,3) * C(5,2) is correct, but what is the question?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:45:28] int-e: my calculator calls that C() operation nCr
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[09:45:40] that's fine, I'm too lazy to type that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[09:46:02] and I don't like the look of 10C3 * 5C2 (which is the notation that that nCr derives from)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:46:50] right
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:47:05] int-e: my question is: why i have to use C() 2 times?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[09:47:43] rendar: Because you're selecting 3 aracde games (that's one C) and 2 sports games (that's the other one)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:48:35] sorry, i misread the excersise!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[09:48:43] yeah, it's clear now
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:51:07] Hi all, a question
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:51:56] I want to understand better how to determine whether an assumption in a set of assumptions is REQUIRED for a proof or is superfluous to the probelm at hand
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:52:25] e.g.  x = 5 & y = 6 & z = 7, therefore x + y = 11 (z is completely unrelated)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:52:40] But not just for this simple example, but more generally to all proofs
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:52:50] Can anybody point me in the right direction?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lieven	[09:55:16] you can try to find counterexamples to theorems if you leave out one of the assumptions
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[09:55:51] lisp123: well, an assumption is superfluous if there's a proof not using the assumption. so identifying required assumptions seems more useful, and you can do that by finding counterexamples to the theorem without the assumption in question
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[09:56:32] (note that required assumptions may still be stronger than necessary)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lieven	[09:57:11] in a more advanced way there's the field of reverse mathematics that works out to what extent theorems have equivalent logical power to their assumptions. Stillwell wrote a fairly accessible account on it.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:58:12] thanks int-e & lieven
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:58:53] I'm trying to find a way of identifying superfluous conditions without prior knowledge of the required assumptions
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:59:14] lieven: thanks for this reverse mathematics lead, I will look into Stillwell now
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[09:59:58] One thing I was thinking, was that if the result of a theorem is expressed in certain variables, e.g. x & y, then checking all the input assumptions - one could disregard any assumption that has no relation AT ALL to the variables used in the result?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[10:00:52] heh, even if a theorem is equivalent to its assumptions, the assumptions may be redundant.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[10:02:16] int-e: thanks, i agree. However would my approach at least strip out some basic assumptions (i.e. some but not all), or would you know if it could be flawed in the sense that some assumptions are incorrectly kicked out?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[10:02:20] s/a theorem/a theorem's conclusion/
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[10:13:00] lieven: if your assumption is never used in the proof, then it is superfluous (to the proof, and hence the result)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[10:13:06] oh they left
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[10:14:16] their question had two levels to it. whether something is not needed for the proof, or whether something is not needed for the result. if its not needed for the proof, obv its not needed for the result. if its not needed for the result, it could still be needed for that particular proof
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[10:14:58] the 1st seems fairly easy enough, the latter is hard.. their last line seems to indicate they are interested in the former
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[10:29:18] how many permutations the letters of the word COLUMNS? 7!  -- how many of them starts with letter 'C' ? (7-1)! ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[10:36:47] yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[10:38:57] rendar: do you understand why?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rendar	[10:39:05] yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lisp123	[10:39:15] cool :-)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lieven	[12:07:07] there's a famous result in number theory where the proof goes as follows: assume the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows. Assume the negation of the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:07:18] If X_j are random variables on R^n with law P and g is a function on R^n, then we know the expectation of Y_j = g(X_j) is int g(x) dP(x). But what about the expectaion of a sum, Z_j = (1/j) sum_k=1^j X_j? is it the anticipated double integral?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	lieven	[12:07:24] intuitively one feels there should be a proof not mentioning RH
2021-07-20 11:29:00	mornfall	[12:10:10] lieven: would you say that any proof with case analysis should intuitively exist in a version without case analysis?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:10:28] Capso: more or less the same formula but with P being the law of the vector (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:11:23] ∫ g((x1+···+xj)/j) dP(x1,…,xj)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:13:43] oops, I need another variable: if k is a function on R^2n and we define, Z_j = (1/j) sum^j k(x,X_k) k(X_j, X_k)? what is E[Z]?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:15:33] nejimban: sorry, i boofed the original Q. how about this corrected Z_j? I would anticipate a double integral, but I've not seen it stated
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:16:07] what is x there?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:17:00] a fixed point, indeoendent of samples
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:17:11] I'm assuming X_j are iid
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:17:24] assuming k measurable, Z_j is a measurable function of (X_1,…,X_j)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:20:37] is j the summing variable?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:21:08] Capso: or you are summing from k=1 up to j
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:21:17] nejimban: the latter
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:21:51] so if the X_k are iid then E[Z] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:23:01] nejimban: how do we get a j in the expectation of Z?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:23:33] sorry it's Z_j not Z
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:24:20] (isn't Z=Z_j? what's Z otherwise?)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:25:14] I don't understand how the expectation of an rv can depend on j
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:26:22] j seems fixed here
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:26:30] nejimban: if X_j are iid then their expectation is int x dP(x) do you agree?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:26:41] you don't need iid
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:26:54] if X_j has law P then E[X_j] = ∫ xdP(x) yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:27:15] nejimban: now I'm defining a new rv, Z_j as above and I want its expectation
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:27:58] I just gave it to you
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:28:16] E[Z_j] = 1/j*[ sum^(j-1) ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) ]
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:28:37] I dont see how there can be a dependence on j?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:28:43] because Z_j depends on j?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:29:07] I might have not parsed your math correctly, could you use e.g. mathb.in?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:39:58] nejimban: mathb.in/61088
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:41:42] nejimban: there should be a (1/j) factor in the def of Z_j, but hopefully you get the idea now
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:43:16] Capso: my computation simplifies to (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:43:27] but I don't agree with the anticipated result you wrote
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:43:53] because the last summand of that sum is k(p, X_j)k(X_j,X_j)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:44:46] ok, i could be wrong, but do you agree that E[Z] can't depend on j?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:45:01] ah, wait, Z is the limit of Z_j?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:45:19] ah no I see
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:45:38] I hadn't got the def of Z, sorry
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:45:58] so yeah, E[Z] does not depend on j
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:46:19] it's (E[Z_1],E[Z_2],…) with E[Z_j] as I gave
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:46:43] I mean that would make no sense... law of large numbers says E[Z] = lim_N (1/N) sum_j^N Z_j
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:48:09] hm
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:48:17] nejimban: couldn't we just iterate LLN and see my result?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:48:34] there is a difference with Z = (Z_1,Z_2,…) and Z = lim Z_j
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:48:38] which is it?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:49:19] nejimban: could you clarify the difference?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:49:58] the first is a sequence of random variables, the second is just one random variable
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:51:13] nejimban: when you compute the expectation of X_j, which def do you use?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:51:48] i think it should be Z = (Z_1, ...)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:53:35] I don't understand what you mean
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:53:54] E[Z_j] = (j-1)/j ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) + 1/j ∫k(x,y)k(y,y)P(dy) tends to ∫∫k(x,y)k(y,z)P(dy)P(dz) as j \to ∞
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:54:12] so you get the value of E[Z] you wrote
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:56:15] ok, so by taking the E of each Z_j as a function of X_j' and then the E of E[Z_j]
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:57:42] yes one needs to distinguish the cases X_j ≠ X_j' and X_j = X_j'
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:57:58] because the laws of (X_j,X_j') differ
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:58:06] a
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[12:58:51] (but as j->infinity the case X_j = X_j' becomes negligible)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[12:59:01] I see
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[13:03:14] nejimban: thanks, that was useful
2021-07-20 11:29:00	biberao	[13:33:06] hi
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Neologik	[13:36:21] how do you traverse an infinite?

2021-07-20 11:29:00	taeaad	[16:10:59] I remember the lecturer going through the whole thing step by step. I was more surprised by the lecturer's thoroughness than I was disappointed in myself for not being able to follow everything.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[16:11:15] oh i haven't seen an actual proof of it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Donitz	[16:12:35] I have a circle with radius r. position 0,0 is at 0 degrees at the edge of the circle
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Donitz	[16:12:46] how can I figure out what angle was used to get to position x,y
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Donitz	[16:13:59] angle less than 90 degrees
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Donitz	[16:14:42] oh wait. I think I just figured it out
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Donitz	[16:15:41] asin(y)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Donitz	[16:16:36] umm... asin(y / radius)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Dotz0cat	[16:21:12] Say I have 2 functions. How would I combine them to get a position vector?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[16:21:55] functions from what to what?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	buster	[16:23:33] Donitz, atan(y/x), or atan2(y,x) if you allow yourself that luxury
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Donitz	[16:23:57] works too, but when under 90 degrees I think asin works just as well
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Donitz	[16:24:07] otherwise obviously it can go back down again
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Dotz0cat	[16:32:20] 2 functions because there is a plus or minus in them. I would like to get them to a vector form. A single vector so I don't have to work with 2 functions
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[16:33:34] atan(y/x) is a crock
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[16:33:40] atan2() is the only sane way
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tusko	[17:11:45] use the substitution u = y/x
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[17:40:53] good morning
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:10:13] is time real ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:10:18] lol
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[18:13:49] yes time is real
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tusko	[18:16:21] no
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tusko	[18:16:29] time is relative
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[18:17:11] how does that make it not real
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tusko	[18:20:49] Well, it just doesn't really exist.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tusko	[18:21:17] It requires a reference point, and even then it is not fixed but constantly evolving.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:22:29] why is there a direction of time ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:22:48] when the reference points are in space ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:23:11] so how can it be opposing directional ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:23:35] let the other directions aside.....
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[18:25:27] tusko, you are wrong
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[18:26:03] Inline, that's a hard question but in terms of physics - even though many physical laws are reversible, entropy isn't
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tusko	[18:27:15] If a rainbow, sprinkle colored unicorn exploded atthe center of the earth, what time did it happen?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[18:27:38] absolute nonsense
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[18:27:41] this may be wandering too far
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:28:19] ok
2021-07-20 11:29:00	 *	Inline [18:54:36] wants a logarithmic mechanical clock for his birthday!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:54:46] lol
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:56:18] so if i used a non homogeneous clock time would be non equally distributed
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:59:04] deez clocks are all out of fashion
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:59:12] i don't feel no time pressure at all!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Inline	[18:59:17] lol
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Dotz0cat	[19:30:13] Say what would I get if I integrated an gradient?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tusko	[19:37:59] wouldn't that return the function by the fundamental theorem of calculus?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[19:39:37] What does it mean to 'integrate a vector'?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rex	[19:42:58] biberao: can you read me?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	kmh	[19:43:06] indeed
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rex	[19:43:27] somiaj: that depends; in what context are you asking
2021-07-20 11:29:00	kmh	[19:43:59] Dotz0cat,'s question i presume
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rex	[19:44:23] I see
2021-07-20 11:29:00	biberao	[19:45:40] rex: yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	biberao	[19:46:04] brb
2021-07-20 11:29:00	biberao	[19:46:08] going to send a fax
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[19:47:32] rex: the question was for Dotz0cat who asked about integrating an gardient.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	rex	[19:48:37] ok thx :)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[20:45:05] nejimban: ping, have a follow up q
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[21:00:20] Capso: here
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Guest78	[21:06:14] hello
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Guest78	[21:06:17] 1+1 = ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[21:15:29] 2
2021-07-20 11:29:00	seL4	[21:24:40] can you determine the probability of the decidability of a program written for a turing machine?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[21:26:57] i th ink you can approximate it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[21:27:01] if you weight small programs more
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[21:27:08] but it will be uncomputable
2021-07-20 11:29:00	seL4	[21:29:25] why is the probability uncomputable?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[21:30:50] well the program may be nontrivial e.g. may have an interpreter for a programming language in it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PinealGlandOptic	[21:31:07] Hi all. What software packages do you know for solving integer linear problems? Wolfram, SymPy, what else?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[21:31:25] nejimban: hey
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[21:33:19] so you can't compute the probability by computing whether it halts on not on each input and adding it up. We actually need to argue conversely, if you could compute the probability exactly that would help you check halting.. but that isn't clear
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PinealGlandOptic	[21:34:03] There was ##math-software on Freenode. Seems not migrated?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[21:40:24] nejimban: Previously we saw that the Z_j = sum_{j'} k(x,X_j') k(X_j', X_j) have expectation given by int k(x,y) int k(y,y') dP(y') dP(y). Say Z_j = k^(2), the exponent denoting the iteration level and suppose we have a convergent Taylor series f(z) = sum_m c_m z^m. Then, does it follow that if we replace z^m with k^(m)_j then the Taylor series has expectation given by the Taylor series with the z^k replaced
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[21:40:30] with iterated integrals?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	seL4	[21:41:19] thanks riv
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[21:42:01] so I can't say 100% its uncomputable
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[21:42:01] Capso: not sure I understood all that :D
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[21:42:32] nejimban: hang on, I'll mathbin
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Dotz0cat	[21:48:09] I am probably not gonna do anything on this today. I have a polar function of theta and r. What would I need to go through to find a PDE with the polar function as a solution?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	seL4	[22:08:37] does the approximation of the probability of the decidability of a program run on a turing machine depend on the number of states of the turing machine?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	seL4	[22:09:14] or I mean, does the approximation of the probability decrease as the number of states of the turing machine increases?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Panther	[22:10:11] https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/07/11/self-cleaning-turing-machine.html
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Panther	[22:10:46] That doesn't answer the question, but coincidentally, I was just looking at that.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[22:13:40] seL4, btw
2021-07-20 11:29:00	riv	[22:13:51] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant related? maybe
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[22:16:17] nejimban: mathb.in/61120
2021-07-20 11:29:00	seL4	[22:17:00] so you can't approximate the probability?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:19:01] Capso: seems interesting (and plausible)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:19:12] I am going to bed soon though
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:20:07] did you make it work for polynomial f?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:20:36] (or, like, just m=3, say)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:21:39] if basic induction works I'm guessing one needs to show that the limits in m and N 'commute'
2021-07-20 11:29:00	dogbert2	[22:25:14] math fail - why estimating the weight of explosives in a containment vessel (instead of actually weighing it) is a very bad idea :)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[22:27:11] nejimban: polynomials are ok because I can bruteforce triangle inequality them
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[22:28:16] nejimban: problem comes in going to infinitely many terms with an alternating series... I need a better convergence method
2021-07-20 11:29:00	seL4	[22:28:53] thanks, riv
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tolarz	[22:33:05] btw, there are universal turing machines with < 5 states
2021-07-20 11:29:00	tolarz	[22:33:21] oh seL4 left
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:36:53] Capso: if k is bounded it should work too
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[22:41:40] nejimban: yea, let's say k is bdd, i forgot to include that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[22:42:34] nejimban: how would that work? say, just exp(-x) ... the limiting series is exponentially increasing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:49:54] Capso: you can bound k^(m) by ||k||^m to get normal convergence of ∑ cₘk⁽m)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:50:27] assuming the power series associated with c_m has infinite radius
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:50:42] or at least ||k||
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:51:36] this should allow to Fubinize sum and expectation
2021-07-20 11:29:00	nejimban	[22:52:17] I'm too tired to write the details
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Capso	[23:22:53] nejimban: normal convergence of whay, sorry? on this interface I can't parse the unicode
2021-07-20 11:29:00	mouseghost	[23:23:15] \sum c_m k (m)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	mouseghost	[23:23:40] or maybe \sum c_m k^m
2021-07-20 11:29:00	mouseghost	[23:23:42] im not sure
2021-07-20 11:29:00	greenbagels	[00:30:42] why is measure theory considered dry? seems like the results are pretty deep / powerful?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	greenbagels	[00:32:14] PinealGlandOptic: it was a dead channel on freenode
2021-07-20 11:29:00	greenbagels	[00:32:43] and what do you mean by integer linear problems, like linear programming?

2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[00:37:59] loopspace: this one is fairly 'obvious' though
2021-07-20 11:29:00	loopspace	[00:38:53] Well, it wasted some time for me, since I learned about Ext from a different book, and was wondering if there was something else going on
2021-07-20 11:29:00	loopspace	[00:39:23] The one from the other day clearly didn't work
2021-07-20 11:29:00	loopspace	[00:41:13] That one did turn into an interesting exercise though, if one ignored the matrix part
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[00:41:50] fair
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[00:42:28] loopspace: if G is abelian I'd have thought Hom(Z,_) is basically an identity functor
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[00:42:57] and on non abelian G it'd be Z[Ab(G)] its abelianization
2021-07-20 11:29:00	loopspace	[00:47:49] Hom_G(Z,_)=Fix^G
2021-07-20 11:29:00	loopspace	[00:48:29] (For Z viewed as a G-trivial module)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[01:08:01] right
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[01:09:04] oh I mixed up my G-module hom functor and Grp's Hom

2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:35:33] I'm tring to wrap my mind around the mathematical framework. It's absurdly complex
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:36:13] Oh, and also play guitar. :D
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[01:36:38] you're almost a smart guy, you can do it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:36:53] Heh. Shaddup!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:36:56] Smart guy lol
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:37:08] Oh I mean.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:37:11] 'almost'. Haha.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:37:20] I laughed at the wrong thing. But I meant to do the other.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:37:29] See? Almost. Maybe you're right.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[01:37:56] damn i'm right
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:38:07] Or... I'm just giving you what you want.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:38:22] And you're the one being psychologically played. Guess shows the almost smart guy now?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:38:32] who's*
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[01:38:51] nah, you're long gone
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[01:39:04] you're just not aware of it yet
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:39:10] That's silly.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:39:15] What is awareness?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:39:20] How do you become aware of something?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[01:39:32] you know it exists
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:39:40] Can I become aware of a random small city in China's whose name I've never heard of?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:39:53] Can I become aware of your family member's name? Nope.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:39:58] I can only ever become aware of things I already know.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[01:40:17] if you can wrap your mind around something in a few days its far from absurdly complex lol
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:40:19] So, if I already know it... what the heck am I trying to be aware of? I already know it.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:40:51] You can't become aware of things you don't know. You can only ever become aware of things you know.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:41:06] Awareness is a really dangerous misunderstood term in the world.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:41:14] dangerously*
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:41:47] And if I don't know it, I alleviate the ignorance by studying it/observing it

2021-07-20 11:29:00	zacts	[01:54:19] I want to learn some number theory
2021-07-20 11:29:00	zacts	[01:54:44] I'm starting with this text on analysis at the moment however
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:57:25] I didn't go to school for math.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:57:31] It is a hobby
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[01:57:58] math is a necessary evil
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:58:03] So I am not fully 100% familiar with everything they talk about in holonomy mathematics of differential geometry and things
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:58:45] And here's a fun question.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:59:08] Why do humans see fractal mathematical patterns in hallucinations, especially those induced by potent psychedelics
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:59:27] What's that all about?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[01:59:41] many things are build like that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:59:50] We're jsut build like that?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:59:55] To hallucinate geometry?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[01:59:59] That's intriguing.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[02:00:03] it's all around us
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:00:10] Why do you start with that, that we're built like that?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[02:00:32] look at the trees for example, you're see it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[02:00:40] you'll*

2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:01:14] Open your eyes, and it goes away
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[02:01:47] yeah, uselles phenomena

2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:02:15] Makes you wonder, what is math?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:02:24] I mean. We have our definitions of it, various ones.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:02:44] But really, what the bloody heck is it and why does nature, is nature, about,... how.. why is it there?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:03:44] Makes you wonder
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:04:20] Is there a mathematical framework to 'thought'? Since thought is nothing more than electrons moving from one place to another in the brain, and the brain has a structure.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa_	[02:05:02] i guess it was discovered
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:05:13] Right
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:05:16] Dis + covered
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:05:28] It was covered, but we uncovered/dis-covered it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:05:45] So it was always there. Why? Why is mathematics required?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa_	[02:05:53] maybe it's just a human thing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	stipa	[02:06:33] it's here, it's of use to us and that's it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[02:06:56] hi
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[02:07:27] if the gcd of consecutive even numbers always 2?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:08:51] See, I always said space intrinsic geometry and that each point in empty space (in that geometry) carries information
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:09:10] Then holonomy was discovered (or invented)?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:09:35] Then I was like, hey I wasn't the only one who thought that, cool. What did they come up with
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Hash	[02:10:12] And same thing. Space has intrinsic geometry and the movement of matter in space has relational geometry
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[02:14:09] paulo_: if m > 1, then  GCD(m, m+1) = 2.   But GCD(1,2) = GCD(0,1) = 1.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[02:14:30] oh crap, it's always 1
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[02:14:50] not sure what I was thinking
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[02:15:00] oh, you said EVEN
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[02:15:04] yeah, even
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[02:15:14] gcd(2n,2n+2)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[02:15:39] yes, that's always 2 (only one of those is a multiple of 4, and no odd prime can divide both)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[02:16:56] Z-module: thanks
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[02:37:37] how do I prove that the only consecutive even numbers whose product is a cube is 2 & 4?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[02:43:05] 2 + 4 = 6 is a cube?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[02:43:13] product
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[02:43:18] grr, yea read that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[02:43:26] just read..
2021-07-20 11:29:00	dude12312414	[02:45:28] missed
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[02:47:07] Well it is equivlant to show that n(n+1)/2 is only a cube if n=1, which intuitivy seems true since n and n+1 won't have enough common factors to be a cube.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[02:47:19] it reduces to showing that the only integer solution of x^3 + 1 = 2y^3 is (x,y) = (1,1)...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frelleck	[02:48:09] you are solving (n+1)(n-1) = x^3 where n +1 and n - 1 are odd
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frelleck	[02:48:19] so they are relatively prive
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frelleck	[02:48:21] prime
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[02:48:26] (we may assume w.l.o.g. that n is odd (we can switch to -n-1 otherwise), and let n = x^3)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frelleck	[02:48:28] hence both cubes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frelleck	[02:48:42] i.e n+1 and n -1 are cubes that differ by 2
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[02:49:13] frelleck: you dropped the factor 2
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frelleck	[02:49:17] oops
2021-07-20 11:29:00	 *	frelleck [02:49:34] looks around for a 2
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo___	[02:50:45] got disconnected
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[02:51:24] You missed a few suggestions, I noted that it is equivlant to showing that n(n+1)/2 is a cube iff n=1.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[02:51:32] sad, IP revealed
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo_	[02:51:49] last message I saw:  frelleck looks around for a 2
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frelleck	[02:52:01] that's the last one
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[02:52:06] then you didn't miss much
2021-07-20 11:29:00	int-e	[02:55:01] oh there are the silly -2 * 0 = 0 * 2 = 0, of course.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	somiaj	[02:56:36] well 0*2 = 0 could be considered a cube.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[02:58:02] So you need n, n+1 where n > 1, one of n, n+1 is an odd cube j^3, and other other is 2^a times an odd cube k^3 with j coprime to k.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Z-module	[02:59:14] and such that  2 + a  is a multiple of 3
2021-07-20 11:29:00	paulo___	[03:44:37] thanks
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[04:42:04] How did people make angular scales before ramsdens machine?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[04:43:52] I read somewhere some craftsmen still basically just used a fixed arc length to cut off the circle
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[04:43:58] How true is that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[04:46:33] ie with a caliper or such set to the arc length
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:52:30] loopspace: do you know how people say reading 'french math' is not hard, even if you dont know french
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:53:08] can you do that? (how do people do that? been trying to read this text, with help of google translate "addon" or w/e widget in chrome.. its slow and annoying)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:53:21] I tried looking for an alternative source, I can't find it either...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[04:53:44] Fangs, french is supposed to be not too hard for english speakers
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:54:32] grammar and sentence structure is similar, supposedly. so "word by word" translation should get you most of the way
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[04:55:35] Fangs, vocabulary also has a lot in common: English has borrowed a lot from French
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:55:35] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BxtLWcMM/Screenshot%20(83).png
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[04:55:49] You'd be surprised, very common words like 'purchase' are actually french
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:56:08] I can see "graduation" <-> "grading" etc
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:56:28] pikapika: just feels a bit uneasy having to "guess" what the text meant
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:56:45] (esp with maths where precision is necessary)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[04:56:47] Fangs, thats actually quite fun to do...at least with a non-technical work
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:57:46] pikapika: this guy's computation is based on objects defined here
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:57:59] and his paper does have an 'appendix' attempting to re-explain everything
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[04:58:12] but I think I'm still forced to read this french source
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[05:00:48] wonder if I can go to fiver or something and just commsion someone to translate these for $5
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[05:12:17] pikapika: ok yeah this is actually not so hard...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Fangs	[05:12:35] (damn I wish I just try reading these instead of finding another source)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[05:12:49] Did you find a bidder on fiver?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[05:13:14] Come on bro, french isn't that hard with the help of a dictionary and some google translate
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Matt|home	[05:57:07] quick question.. for order of operations does it matter if you do division/multiplication in either order as long as it's left to right
