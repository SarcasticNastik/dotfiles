2021-07-13 16:25:32	buster	Fangs, yeas, you need open and continuous for the topologies to match. Think of the discrete topology on G!
2021-07-13 16:25:36	rubiksdream	but in general quotient maps need not be open/closed
2021-07-13 16:25:54	Fangs	I...
2021-07-13 16:25:57	Fangs	need to prove that

2021-07-13 16:28:09	Fangs	buster: yeah I did thought of that, or rather indiscrete topology on G/N, then the map G -> (G/N)_{indiscrete} is cts, and ofc you can have it factor through G -> (G/N)_{quotient top} -> (G/N)_{indiscrete} and have it be cts
2021-07-13 16:28:47	Fangs	its just a bit uncomfortable when you think of "natural" examples in the wild, like R/Z and S^1, a priori this needs not have the topology you think of etc

2021-07-13 20:53:20	rubiksdream	for example when p(x,y) = |(x,y)| then you get the usual euclidean distance

2021-07-13 20:56:34	somiaj	though I guess a norm has additonal properities, and distance is just defined as d(a,b) = || a - b ||
2021-07-13 20:56:40	somiaj	well p(a-b)
2021-07-13 20:56:49	rubiksdream	maybe, but it can be pretty far away from a norm
2021-07-13 20:56:57	rubiksdream	its any smooth enough scalar field
2021-07-13 20:57:01	somiaj	yea, if it is just a non-negative map, it doesn't have to be a norm.
2021-07-13 20:58:22	somiaj	well if a < b then int_0^1 a dt < int_0^1 b dt, so your claim would hold since |gamma'(t)| p_1(gamma(t)) < |gamma'(t)| p_2(gamma(t))

2021-07-13 21:04:10	somiaj	or you could see if adding a continunity restriction to p_1 and p_2 help. I wonder if continuity is enough to show that there is a path that takes on the infinum value, thus it is actually a minimum value. And if so then it would follow.

2021-07-13 21:09:35	rubiksdream	p could be something really simple like the euclidean metric (x,y) -> 1, and there might not be a shortest path
2021-07-13 21:10:01	rubiksdream	for instance take a punctured disk, and take two points radially opposite each other across the puncture
2021-07-13 21:10:11	rubiksdream	the shortest path is certainly the straight line path, but its not in the domain
2021-07-13 21:10:18	rubiksdream	so any other C^1 path is not going to be as short
2021-07-13 21:11:44	rubiksdream	for sure there is a sequence of paths tending to that
2021-07-13 21:11:48	rubiksdream	maybe that can be used somehow
2021-07-13 21:12:13	somiaj	ahh yea, I guess you could try to create a counter example to show that you don't have enough conditions to ensure the distance is strictly smaller
2021-07-13 21:12:22	somiaj	any reason you need < instead of just <= in the final distance comparision?

2021-07-14 20:33:56	rubiksdream	probably the coolest result relating to this stuff is that the degree of a homogeneous irreducible polynomial determines the genus of the corresponding algebraic curve
2021-07-14 20:34:25	rubiksdream	the higher the degree, the more holes the surface has
2021-07-14 20:35:34	Franciman	yup
2021-07-14 20:35:35	rubiksdream	the formula is also pretty clean, g = (d-1 choose 2)
2021-07-14 20:35:37	Franciman	cool
2021-07-14 20:35:58	rubiksdream	so that shows for instance, when d = 0,1, g = 0, P^1(C) is a sphere

2021-07-14 20:36:44	Franciman	but what about U_1?
2021-07-14 20:36:53	Franciman	so P^1(C) has two complex planes intersecting?
2021-07-14 20:37:00	rubiksdream	johnkeats7 the version I know uses bezouts theorem and the riemann-hurwitz formula
2021-07-14 20:37:01	johnkeats7	was it the riemann hurwitz thing
2021-07-14 20:37:03	rubiksdream	yeah

2021-07-14 20:46:40	Franciman	what I get
2021-07-14 20:46:48	Franciman	when I read things in these two charts
2021-07-14 20:47:11	Franciman	B_0 = { ((z, w); [1, b]) \in C^2 \times U_0 : aw + bz = 0 }
2021-07-14 20:47:25	Franciman	so I again watch the projective complex line in the two charts
2021-07-14 20:47:38	Franciman	it is as if I split the possible tangent lines
2021-07-14 20:47:40	Franciman	in two spaces
2021-07-14 20:48:19	Franciman	so I think it is like, in B_0 you take all tangents except the one with coordinate x = 0
2021-07-14 20:48:26	Franciman	so the x axis
2021-07-14 20:48:35	Franciman	and in B_1 you take all tangets except the one with coordinate y = 0
2021-07-14 20:50:10	rubiksdream	okay, so in B_0 you take all the tangents except {y=0} and in B_1 you take all the tangents except {x=0}, so in other words (using dual P^1(C) to parameterize tangents), you are really looking at U_0 and U_1

2021-07-14 20:52:05	Franciman	something like this, yep
2021-07-14 20:52:09	Franciman	you do this, because
2021-07-14 20:52:21	Franciman	if you are given a singular surface S
2021-07-14 20:52:28	Franciman	and it is singular in (0, 0)
2021-07-14 20:52:31	Franciman	you say, ok
2021-07-14 20:52:37	Franciman	there must be some tangent missing
2021-07-14 20:52:54	Franciman	or there are too many tangents
2021-07-14 20:53:05	rubiksdream	well there would be several higher tangents
2021-07-14 20:53:10	rubiksdream	at a singular point
2021-07-14 20:53:18	Franciman	yup
2021-07-14 20:53:20	Franciman	so you do
2021-07-14 20:53:25	Franciman	well first you define
2021-07-14 20:53:41	Franciman	pi : B -> C^2 , as pi((z, w); [a, b])) = (z, w)
2021-07-14 20:53:45	Franciman	and then you do
2021-07-14 20:54:06	Franciman	S' = topological closure of pi^{-1}(S - {0})
2021-07-14 20:54:21	Franciman	so what you do is like, get all the S, except for 0
2021-07-14 20:54:34	Franciman	but now, 0 is replaced by many copies of 0
2021-07-14 20:54:40	Franciman	one for each direction of the tangents
2021-07-14 20:54:44	Franciman	in case of a node
2021-07-14 20:54:46	Franciman	you would get
2021-07-14 20:55:03	Franciman	((0, 0); [1, 0]) and ((0, 0); [0, 1])
2021-07-14 20:55:13	Franciman	(after a bit of affine transformations)
2021-07-14 20:55:21	rubiksdream	so one for each tangent?
2021-07-14 20:55:24	Franciman	exactly!
2021-07-14 20:55:30	Franciman	if you squint enough
2021-07-14 20:55:41	Franciman	what you do when you do the topological closure of pi^{-1}(S - {0})
2021-07-14 20:55:45	Franciman	is get the secant
2021-07-14 20:55:51	Franciman	from 0 to a point (z, w)
2021-07-14 20:55:57	Franciman	and make (z,w) converge to 0
2021-07-14 20:56:00	Franciman	so you get the tangent
2021-07-14 20:56:29	Franciman	so you get the different tangents at 0

2021-07-14 21:02:20	Franciman	to simplify things, because you then end up in a subset of C^2
2021-07-14 21:02:43	Franciman	so there you can compute the closure by calculating the limit points

2021-07-14 22:47:26	CuriousErnestBro	qergle the only answer I can give you there is if you have E[X|X=x] where X takes on a "realized" value x, then X=X means that X takes on its own value, so it's the same as E[X|X]
2021-07-14 22:48:55	qergle	an RV is a function from the sample space (often denoted Ω) to ℝ (real numbers)

2021-07-15 18:13:29	buster	*connected component of the identity
2021-07-15 18:13:30	Fangs	buster: O(3) is effectively Z/2Z x SO(3)
2021-07-15 18:14:00	Fangs	so to get to the other half you need your Z/2Z to act on the image to get to the 'other' part of O(3)
2021-07-15 18:14:11	rubiksdream	in general there are as many covers (up to isomorphism) as subgroups of a spaces fundamental group
2021-07-15 18:14:30	rubiksdream	so as long as a space is not simply connected, there are non simply connected covers
2021-07-15 18:14:33	Fangs	rubiksdream: aren't lie algebras always contractible as manifolds?
2021-07-15 18:14:51	Fangs	(tangent space at identity)
2021-07-15 18:15:20	rubiksdream	i dont think so
2021-07-15 18:15:33	rubiksdream	you need some more conditions
2021-07-15 18:16:11	Fangs	rubiksdream: tangent space at a point is contractible no?

2021-07-15 18:18:28	rubiksdream	yes
2021-07-15 18:18:36	rubiksdream	but why does that mean the lie group is contractible
2021-07-15 18:18:40	rubiksdream	what about the circle group?
2021-07-15 18:18:49	Fangs	rubiksdream: no, the lie *algebra* is contractible

2021-07-15 18:19:09	rubiksdream	oh, hm
2021-07-15 18:19:19	Fangs	22:41 <Fangs> my thought was this: if exp: so3 -> SO(3) is surjective, then so3 ~= R^3 is a covering map. morever its a universal cover, but the universal cover of SO(3) is SU(2) (homeo to S^3)
2021-07-15 18:19:48	Fangs	my claim here was that so3, if exp were a covering map, would be a universal cover
2021-07-15 18:20:10	rubiksdream	oh i didnt see so3 ~= R^3, sorry
2021-07-15 18:20:27	Fangs	its fine, its annoying to read lie algebra/lie group notation
2021-07-15 18:20:28	rubiksdream	yes you are right, *if* exp were a covering map
2021-07-15 18:20:39	Fangs	and in physics they dont even make the distinction, often
2021-07-15 18:20:44	rubiksdream	then indeed, R^3 would be *the* universal cover of SO(3)
2021-07-15 18:20:57	rubiksdream	yes this line of logic works
2021-07-15 18:21:08	rubiksdream	so exp : so3 -> SO(3) cannot be a covering map
2021-07-15 18:21:12	rubiksdream	(although it is surjective)
2021-07-15 18:21:13	Fangs	idk what bullshit I spouted about SO(3) not being simply connected though, that's entirely false
2021-07-15 18:21:31	Fangs	rubiksdream: yeah thats the correction I learnt after the discussion with buster
2021-07-15 18:21:59	Fangs	(for S^1.. and abelian lie groups.. which is just S^1 x S^1 x ... x S^1) the exp map happens to be a covering map too
2021-07-15 18:22:32	Fangs	I kinda want to know in which cases exp is a covering map
2021-07-15 18:25:12	Fangs	https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3190787/when-is-exponential-map-from-lie-algebra-to-lie-group-a-covering-map
2021-07-15 18:25:24	Fangs	exp is a covering map if and only if g is solvable and does not contain two particular Lie subalgebras e, e~.
2021-07-15 18:25:31	Fangs	I don't really udnerstand anything past 'solvable'

2021-07-15 20:38:14	Z-module	so if you needed to do an integral like  \int e^(v^2) v dv   you could skip the notation for making a new variable name (u = v^2) and just rewrite that as  (1/2) \int e^(v^2) d(v^2)  so the answer is  (1/2) e^(v^2) + C

2021-07-15 21:03:04	biberao	hi
2021-07-15 21:03:07	qergle	then we'd have W = ∫ kx dx (with limits being the two displacements)
2021-07-15 21:03:50	[-_-]	right....but tell me what you mean by F here? total restoring force?

2021-07-15 21:05:03	qergle	i am not sure on the terminology (restoring, etc) but if a spring has constant "k", and if you stretch it "x" from rest, the force exerted is -kx.
2021-07-15 21:05:30	qergle	that's my F. is that restoring force? seems like it fits since it's the force needed to go back to rest.
2021-07-15 21:05:38	hanif	'My problem is if dx' is the distance then F should be equal to k*dx'' => dx' is not the extension of the spring, rather here it means an infinitesimal change in the extension. F is a function of the entire extension (from equilibrium)
2021-07-15 21:06:20	hanif	qergle: yeah that's the restoring force
2021-07-15 21:06:29	qergle	thanks

2021-07-15 21:12:34	[-_-]	why?
2021-07-15 21:13:00	hanif	incidentally that does give the answer. but show your steps

2021-07-15 21:13:10	hanif	so we can follow your thought process
2021-07-15 21:13:41	qergle	often we will denote the inner integral as kx (bc the limits are 0 and x)
2021-07-15 21:13:52	[-_-]	small change in extension means small change in force....

2021-07-15 21:22:28	qergle	ok, before i go, let me add a graphical dimension. say you plotted F(x) on graph paper. so x on the x-axis and F(x) is the vertical distance at each x. if you want work from x=a to x=b you want the area under the curve. in other words, you want to add up the little forces from a to a+Δ then a+Δ to a+2*Δ, etc. like you did back when you did the trapezoid approx. the limit of this as your partition shrinks is the riemann integral, denoted: ∫ F(x)dx

2021-07-16 19:29:44	rubiksdream	and then conclude as you and cherim are implying

2021-07-16 19:31:12	cherim	Or something like this
2021-07-16 19:31:20	johnkeats6	yeah.
2021-07-16 19:31:33	johnkeats6	that works whenever there's a pair of points minimizing the distance between the two sets
2021-07-16 19:31:42	johnkeats6	the general case is more annoying and involves trickery
2021-07-16 19:32:23	cherim	General case has a very cute proof based on transfinite induction
2021-07-16 19:32:44	cherim	You enlarge the sets keeping them convex and non-intersecting
2021-07-16 19:32:54	Z-module	yeah, I was overlooking the case of {all the x_i} having just two points before, but that's easily dismissed first.
2021-07-16 19:33:34	cherim	By taking an arbitrary unused point in the plane and joining it either to all points of set A or to all points of set B with segments
2021-07-16 19:33:44	cherim	Final configuration fills all the plane
2021-07-16 19:34:32	cherim	It is therefore necessarily two full halfplanes, except possibly the dividing line is partially in both sets
2021-07-16 19:34:42	johnkeats6	why are they still disjoint?
2021-07-16 19:34:48	johnkeats6	after you cone
2021-07-16 19:35:08	cherim	One of the two variants (to A or to B) keeps everything
