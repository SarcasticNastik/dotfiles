2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-17 15:00:02	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-17 15:00:02	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.

2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-17 19:43:52	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-17 19:43:52	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?

2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-17 19:43:52	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-17 19:43:52	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi

2021-07-17 21:16:52	Kinars	hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-17 21:17:56	earnestly	Sure
2021-07-17 21:18:06	Kinars	So who is right>?
2021-07-17 21:18:11	DeanGuss	"devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-17 21:18:14	earnestly	You of course
2021-07-17 21:18:32	earnestly	It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-17 21:20:38	earnestly	I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.

2021-07-17 21:20:51	DeanGuss	specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-17 21:20:57	earnestly	That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-17 21:21:04	Kinars	i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-17 21:21:05	Kinars	[14:59]
2021-07-17 21:21:05	Kinars	While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-17 21:22:19	earnestly	Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-17 21:22:32	earnestly	And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it

2021-07-17 21:24:45	Kinars	yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-17 21:25:40	Kinars	while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found

2021-07-17 21:27:42	earnestly	He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-17 21:28:07	earnestly	Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-17 21:28:26	earnestly	(They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-17 21:28:54	earnestly	Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-17 21:29:24	ghost43	miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-17 21:29:24	ghost43	or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-17 21:29:36	Kinars	He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-17 21:29:38	earnestly	(Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-17 21:29:43	earnestly	That's okay
2021-07-17 21:30:20	ghost43	lol
2021-07-17 21:30:26	earnestly	Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-17 21:30:50	earnestly	So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-17 21:33:26	ghost43	Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-17 21:33:51	bugs_	nice :-)
2021-07-17 21:34:34	Kinars	yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block

2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-17 23:35:19	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-17 23:35:19	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-17 23:35:19	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-17 23:35:19	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-17 23:35:19	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-17 23:35:19	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-17 23:35:19	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-17 23:35:19	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-17 23:35:19	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)

2021-07-17 23:37:27	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-17 23:37:27	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-17 23:37:27	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-17 23:37:27	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-17 23:37:27	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-17 23:37:27	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-17 23:37:27	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-17 23:37:27	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-17 23:37:27	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-17 23:37:27	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-17 23:37:27	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-17 23:37:27	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-17 23:37:27	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)

2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-17 23:53:31	belcher	[08:11:07] yep

2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-17 23:53:31	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-17 23:53:31	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-17 23:53:31	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-17 23:53:31	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-17 23:53:31	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-17 23:53:31	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-17 23:53:31	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-17 23:53:31	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)

2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-17 23:54:17	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-17 23:54:18	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-17 23:54:18	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-17 23:54:18	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-17 23:54:18	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-17 23:54:18	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-17 23:54:18	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-17 23:54:18	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-17 23:54:18	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-17 23:54:18	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-17 23:54:18	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-17 23:54:18	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-17 23:54:18	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-17 23:54:18	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-17 23:54:18	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)

2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-17 23:58:54	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.

2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-17 23:58:54	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid

2021-07-17 23:58:54	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-17 23:58:54	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-17 23:58:54	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-17 23:58:54	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-17 23:58:54	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-17 23:58:54	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:

2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-18 00:01:22	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-18 00:01:22	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-18 00:01:22	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-18 00:01:23	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-18 00:01:23	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me

2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-18 00:01:23	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-18 00:01:23	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-18 00:01:23	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-18 00:01:23	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-18 00:01:23	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-18 00:01:23	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-18 00:01:23	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:

2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-18 01:15:18	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-18 01:15:18	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-18 01:15:18	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-18 01:15:18	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found

2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-18 01:15:18	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners

2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-18 01:15:18	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS

2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)

2021-07-18 01:15:18	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-18 01:15:18	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-18 01:15:18	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH

2021-07-18 01:15:18	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-18 01:15:18	frank2	[19:44:13] :p

2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-18 04:51:00	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-18 04:51:00	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-18 04:51:00	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-18 04:51:00	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-18 04:51:00	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-18 04:51:00	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-18 04:51:00	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)

2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-18 04:51:00	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-18 04:51:00	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-18 04:51:00	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-18 04:51:00	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-18 04:51:00	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-18 04:51:00	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-18 04:51:00	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-18 04:51:00	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again

2021-07-18 05:06:01	amanr	hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?
2021-07-18 05:06:23	amanr	For miniscript, I'm mostly following the sipa blog for referencing (back and forth) and understanding

2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-18 05:12:19	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-18 05:12:19	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-18 05:12:19	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-18 05:12:20	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-18 05:12:20	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-18 05:12:20	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-18 05:12:20	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-18 05:12:20	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-18 05:12:20	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-18 05:12:20	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-18 05:12:20	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-18 05:12:20	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-18 05:12:20	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-18 05:12:20	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-18 05:12:20	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-18 05:12:20	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-18 05:12:20	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-18 05:12:20	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-18 05:12:20	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?
2021-07-18 05:12:20	amanr	[23:36:23] For miniscript, I'm mostly following the sipa blog for referencing (back and forth) and understanding

2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-18 16:36:24	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-18 16:36:24	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-18 16:36:24	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-18 16:36:24	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-18 16:36:24	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-18 16:36:24	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-18 16:36:24	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-18 16:36:24	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-18 16:36:24	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-18 16:36:24	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-18 16:36:24	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-18 16:36:24	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-18 16:36:24	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-18 16:36:24	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-18 16:36:24	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-18 16:36:24	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-18 16:36:24	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-18 16:36:24	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	amanr	[23:36:23] For miniscript, I'm mostly following the sipa blog for referencing (back and forth) and understanding
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	tarsier [23:37:25] waves
2021-07-18 16:36:24	tarsier	[23:47:55] is there a way to do trustless mining pools?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	ufotofu_	[01:58:07] check out p2pool
2021-07-18 16:36:24	negan	[08:09:59] are there any android mining apps?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	retrosenator	[08:10:38] why would there be
2021-07-18 16:36:24	negan	[08:11:48] curiosity
2021-07-18 16:36:24	HeySteve	[08:12:05] there are plenty of scam ones
2021-07-18 16:36:24	retrosenator	[08:12:18] what would be the point?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-18 16:36:24	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-18 16:36:24	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	jasan	[10:08:44] achow101: Thank you for the fix in #22461!

2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-18 20:21:09	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-18 20:21:09	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-18 20:21:09	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-18 20:21:09	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-18 20:21:09	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-18 20:21:09	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-18 20:21:09	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-18 20:21:09	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-18 20:21:09	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-18 20:21:09	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-18 20:21:09	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-18 20:21:09	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-18 20:21:09	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-18 20:21:09	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-18 20:21:09	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-18 20:21:09	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[23:36:23] For miniscript, I'm mostly following the sipa blog for referencing (back and forth) and understanding
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	tarsier [23:37:25] waves
2021-07-18 20:21:09	tarsier	[23:47:55] is there a way to do trustless mining pools?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	ufotofu_	[01:58:07] check out p2pool
2021-07-18 20:21:09	negan	[08:09:59] are there any android mining apps?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	retrosenator	[08:10:38] why would there be
2021-07-18 20:21:09	negan	[08:11:48] curiosity
2021-07-18 20:21:09	HeySteve	[08:12:05] there are plenty of scam ones
2021-07-18 20:21:09	retrosenator	[08:12:18] what would be the point?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-18 20:21:09	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-18 20:21:09	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jasan	[10:08:44] achow101: Thank you for the fix in #22461!
2021-07-18 20:21:09	darosior	[12:47:07] amanr: there is only the miniscript website that i know of. Also feel free to join ##miniscript to ask for specifics
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[13:48:21] darosior: Sure thanks

2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-19 11:15:18	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-19 11:15:18	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-19 11:15:18	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-19 11:15:18	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-19 11:15:18	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-19 11:15:18	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-19 11:15:18	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-19 11:15:18	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-19 11:15:18	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-19 11:15:18	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-19 11:15:18	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-19 11:15:18	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-19 11:15:18	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-19 11:15:18	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-19 11:15:18	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-19 11:15:18	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?

2021-07-19 11:15:18	retrosenator	[08:12:18] what would be the point?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-19 11:15:18	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-19 11:15:18	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?

2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-19 11:45:31	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-19 11:45:31	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-19 11:45:31	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-19 11:45:31	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-19 11:45:31	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-19 11:45:31	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-19 11:45:31	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-19 11:45:31	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-19 11:45:31	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-19 11:45:31	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-19 11:45:31	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-19 11:45:31	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-19 11:45:31	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-19 11:45:31	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-19 11:45:31	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-19 11:45:31	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-19 11:45:31	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?

2021-07-19 11:45:31	retrosenator	[08:12:18] what would be the point?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-19 11:45:31	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-19 11:45:31	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?

2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-19 18:40:02	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-19 18:40:02	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-19 18:40:02	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-19 18:40:02	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-19 18:40:02	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-19 18:40:02	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-19 18:40:02	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-19 18:40:02	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-19 18:40:02	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-19 18:40:02	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-19 18:40:02	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-19 18:40:02	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-19 18:40:02	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-19 18:40:02	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-19 18:40:02	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-19 18:40:02	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	amanr	[23:36:23] For miniscript, I'm mostly following the sipa blog for referencing (back and forth) and understanding

2021-07-19 18:40:02	negan	[08:09:59] are there any android mining apps?

2021-07-19 18:40:02	HeySteve	[08:12:05] there are plenty of scam ones
2021-07-19 18:40:02	retrosenator	[08:12:18] what would be the point?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-19 18:40:02	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-19 18:40:02	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-19 18:40:02	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?

2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-20 10:40:20	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-20 10:40:20	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-20 10:40:20	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-20 10:40:20	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-20 10:40:20	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-20 10:40:20	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-20 10:40:20	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-20 10:40:20	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-20 10:40:20	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-20 10:40:20	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-20 10:40:20	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-20 10:40:20	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-20 10:40:20	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-20 10:40:20	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	amanr	[23:36:23] For miniscript, I'm mostly following the sipa blog for referencing (back and forth) and understanding

2021-07-20 10:40:20	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-20 10:40:20	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-20 10:40:20	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-20 10:40:20	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?

2021-07-20 10:40:20	chazy	[13:31:15] hi, would it be possible to use bitcoin-qt graphical interface with a full node in another host? i mean make the wallet bit connect to a remote full node
2021-07-20 10:40:20	muhkey	[13:33:30] afaik no
2021-07-20 10:40:20	muhkey	[13:33:43] you need electrum style wallet for that
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chazy	[13:38:07] ok so i want to move the full node from my workstation (which is not always powered on) to a headless server, i guess all i need is to run the daemon and that's it? https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/bitcoin-daemon/
2021-07-20 10:40:20	muhkey	[13:45:40] if you want to then access your node remotely I think you will need an electrum server
2021-07-20 10:40:20	muhkey	[13:45:41] https://electrum.org/#home
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[14:02:48] chazy: You can use the RPC system to do that but any actions you take will be done to and on that node
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[14:03:34] So atm you can't have a wallet only bitcoin-qt that uses information from a remote note, making a wallet will make it on that node's machine
2021-07-20 10:40:20	earnestly	[14:03:41] This may change with --multiprocess, not sure
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chazy	[14:04:38] hmm i think what i want are 2 different things, one to move/host the full node from my workstation to a headless remote server and to move the wallets to a lightweight client
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chazy	[15:54:26] would there be any difference between -daemon and ctrl-z + bg?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Diablo-D3	[15:55:44] why not just daemon it to begin with?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	chazy	[17:18:23] is it possible to have wallets with a full node in a headless server? (no bitcoin-qt)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evanito[m]	[17:21:09] Seriously, use the electrum server
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Evanito[m]	[17:21:22] It will do exactly what you are looking for

2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-20 10:40:41	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-20 10:40:41	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-20 10:40:41	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-20 10:40:41	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-20 10:40:41	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-20 10:40:41	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-20 10:40:41	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-20 10:40:41	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-20 10:40:41	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-20 10:40:41	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-20 10:40:41	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made.

2021-07-20 10:40:41	retrosenator	[08:12:18] what would be the point?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-20 10:40:41	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-20 10:40:41	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?

2021-07-20 10:40:41	chazy	[13:31:15] hi, would it be possible to use bitcoin-qt graphical interface with a full node in another host? i mean make the wallet bit connect to a remote full node
2021-07-20 10:40:41	muhkey	[13:33:30] afaik no
2021-07-20 10:40:41	muhkey	[13:33:43] you need electrum style wallet for that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	chazy	[13:38:07] ok so i want to move the full node from my workstation (which is not always powered on) to a headless server, i guess all i need is to run the daemon and that's it? https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/bitcoin-daemon/
2021-07-20 10:40:41	muhkey	[13:45:40] if you want to then access your node remotely I think you will need an electrum server
2021-07-20 10:40:41	muhkey	[13:45:41] https://electrum.org/#home
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[14:02:48] chazy: You can use the RPC system to do that but any actions you take will be done to and on that node
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[14:03:34] So atm you can't have a wallet only bitcoin-qt that uses information from a remote note, making a wallet will make it on that node's machine
2021-07-20 10:40:41	earnestly	[14:03:41] This may change with --multiprocess, not sure
2021-07-20 10:40:41	chazy	[14:04:38] hmm i think what i want are 2 different things, one to move/host the full node from my workstation to a headless remote server and to move the wallets to a lightweight client
2021-07-20 10:40:41	chazy	[15:54:26] would there be any difference between -daemon and ctrl-z + bg?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Diablo-D3	[15:55:44] why not just daemon it to begin with?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	chazy	[17:18:23] is it possible to have wallets with a full node in a headless server? (no bitcoin-qt)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Evanito[m]	[17:21:09] Seriously, use the electrum server

2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-20 11:28:45	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-20 11:28:45	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-20 11:28:45	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-20 11:28:45	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-20 11:28:45	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-20 11:28:45	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-20 11:28:45	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-20 11:28:45	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-20 11:28:45	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-20 11:28:45	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	amanr	[23:36:23] For miniscript, I'm mostly following the sipa blog for referencing (back and forth) and understanding

2021-07-20 11:28:46	tarsier	[23:47:55] is there a way to do trustless mining pools?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	ufotofu_	[01:58:07] check out p2pool
2021-07-20 11:28:46	negan	[08:09:59] are there any android mining apps?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	retrosenator	[08:10:38] why would there be
2021-07-20 11:28:46	negan	[08:11:48] curiosity
2021-07-20 11:28:46	HeySteve	[08:12:05] there are plenty of scam ones
2021-07-20 11:28:46	retrosenator	[08:12:18] what would be the point?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-20 11:28:46	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-20 11:28:46	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-20 11:28:46	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-20 11:28:46	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-20 11:28:46	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	jasan	[10:08:44] achow101: Thank you for the fix in #22461!
2021-07-20 11:28:46	darosior	[12:47:07] amanr: there is only the miniscript website that i know of. Also feel free to join ##miniscript to ask for specifics
2021-07-20 11:28:46	amanr	[13:48:21] darosior: Sure thanks

2021-07-20 11:28:46	chazy	[13:31:15] hi, would it be possible to use bitcoin-qt graphical interface with a full node in another host? i mean make the wallet bit connect to a remote full node
2021-07-20 11:28:46	muhkey	[13:33:30] afaik no
2021-07-20 11:28:46	muhkey	[13:33:43] you need electrum style wallet for that
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chazy	[13:38:07] ok so i want to move the full node from my workstation (which is not always powered on) to a headless server, i guess all i need is to run the daemon and that's it? https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/bitcoin-daemon/
2021-07-20 11:28:46	muhkey	[13:45:40] if you want to then access your node remotely I think you will need an electrum server
2021-07-20 11:28:46	muhkey	[13:45:41] https://electrum.org/#home
2021-07-20 11:28:46	earnestly	[14:02:48] chazy: You can use the RPC system to do that but any actions you take will be done to and on that node
2021-07-20 11:28:46	earnestly	[14:03:34] So atm you can't have a wallet only bitcoin-qt that uses information from a remote note, making a wallet will make it on that node's machine
2021-07-20 11:28:46	earnestly	[14:03:41] This may change with --multiprocess, not sure
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chazy	[14:04:38] hmm i think what i want are 2 different things, one to move/host the full node from my workstation to a headless remote server and to move the wallets to a lightweight client
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chazy	[15:54:26] would there be any difference between -daemon and ctrl-z + bg?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Diablo-D3	[15:55:44] why not just daemon it to begin with?
2021-07-20 11:28:46	chazy	[17:18:23] is it possible to have wallets with a full node in a headless server? (no bitcoin-qt)
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Evanito[m]	[17:21:09] Seriously, use the electrum server
2021-07-20 11:28:46	Evanito[m]	[17:21:22] It will do exactly what you are looking for

2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:17:36] is the seed phrase fully adequate to recover all my private keys that associate with my wallet addresses that i received btc to?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[07:21:07] cvmn yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:22:36] odd.  how?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:23:37] how will the network know if my seed means that i am the owner of the many public keys?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[07:24:48] your seed phrase is deterministically converted to all those privkey/pubkey pairs
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:25:31] how many private keys can be stored in a seed phrase?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:31:58] belcher: so my seed is the seed of a random sequence that will produce all my private-public keys?   i.e. all my wallet addresses technically have an entropy equal to my seed's entropy?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[07:43:24] cvmn an infinite number of privkeys can be generated from a seed phrase
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[07:43:37] yes you are correct about entropy
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:48:28] whats the point for the words list in BP39?  is it to make it memorable?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:50:26] or is it for superior error correction should some letters get deleted by time?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[07:55:12] both of those
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[07:55:40] also writing down actual words in natural language seems to be easier than writing down random symbols with a mix of uppercase and lowercase
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[07:55:57] have a read of https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:55:58] easier how?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[07:57:02] imagine if you had a pencil and paper, compare how easy it is to write down "witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least" compared to "5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[07:59:10] is that base64?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:00:16] it is base58
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:01:01] why does it lack special characters?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:01:25] some design decision
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:01:36] the ecosystem is slowly moving away from using base58
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:01:59] new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:02:13] anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:02:32] not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:02:43] iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:02:52] how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:03:13] i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:03:41] do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Keele	[08:03:50] base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:03:51] yeah.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:03:59] Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:04:59] log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:08:14] belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:10:49] but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	belcher	[08:11:07] yep
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:14:16] which site shows the most up-to-date btc/altcoin/etc exchange rates?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:17:59] mmhmm
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:18:46] rates differ between markets.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	cvmn	[08:21:59] how so?  isn't btc global?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:52:58] not all buyers and sellers have to agree on the same prices
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:53:28] sometimes markets prices are affected by the fees imposed by the exchange, for example
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:53:54] you're free to buy/sell above or below the "market" price
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:55:13] if i offer to sell at $1/BTC and you agree to buy at that price, that is an exchange rate.  we don't have to publicize that rate to the public.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:56:06] it's the same for fiat forex.  not all forex bureaus in the same city use the same rate
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[08:56:35] any reason why some linux distros are delaying updating bitcoin-qt package?  some say taproot's consensus update is controversial and needs thinking.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:57:17] could they not just compile the package with opt-out by default?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[08:58:32] talking to me?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:58:41] idk, just talking to the channel
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:58:45] were you talking to me?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[08:58:53] no.  but did you respond to me?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[08:59:00] miner block templates produced by this version of Bitcoin Core will signal readiness to enforce taproot
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[09:05:14] caveman: I think if you want the answer to that question, you could go to the different linux distros which are delaying updating the bitcoin-qt package and ask there
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[09:05:37] that doesn't __answer__ the question.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[09:05:51] of course it doesn't
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[09:05:53] err, actually it does.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[09:05:58] sorry i misread.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[09:06:00] but it could lead you to an answer, perhaps
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[09:06:08] yes.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[09:06:20] but i don't trust them.  i'd like to hear hypotheses from others.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[09:06:28] the distro I use does not even provide bitcoin as a package.  I have delayed updating because I have not seen a reason to update
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[09:06:38] remember that btc is money.  as such is a sensitive component and there is a lot of conflict of interest.  hence we must ask multiple parties.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[09:07:55] from what I understand 0.21.1 is only moving to being able to handle taproot.  There is still time for miners to decide whether or not to support it.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[09:08:10] not yet activated
2021-07-20 11:29:00	shiza	[09:49:46] Why bitinfocharts shows no info for several big exchanges' wallets? Is it because of technical issues, or is that an externally induced opacity?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[10:16:11] why is it that bitcoin links don't download in uk?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[10:17:55] another question:  which aspect of btc limits the maximum number of mineable bitcoins?  is this number hardcoded as a constant?  or is it due to the selection of the variable type that is used as a counter for coins?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[10:27:42] it's possibly arbitrary
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[10:29:17] i.e. some equation/logic added to forbid miners to claim new coins after some total capacity is reached?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[10:31:20] block reward halves roughly every 4 years.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[10:31:41] the block reward is the newly minted coin(s)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[10:36:19] halves for a given difficulty?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[10:36:48] nope, it just halves.  the reward is the newly minted coin when a block has been solved
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[10:37:18] oh.  difficulty is an independent concept.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[10:37:30] the miner does not specify the amount of the reward, the protocol specifies it.  if a miner tried to claim more than the current reward, the network would reject it as invalid
2021-07-20 11:29:00	caveman	[10:39:46] yes.  got it.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Lyza	[12:50:54] hey y'all. I run a public node, and often can't connect to my own node (via bip 157) because the connections have been maxed out. white listing a particular IP address isn't an ideal solution because the IP I'm connecting from often changes or is a shared VPN. uncapping the number of incoming connections isn't ideal cause, system resources
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Lyza	[12:51:07] any other options for ensuring I can connect to my own node?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Lyza	[12:52:23] apologies if I'm missing something obvi
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edcba	[14:27:03] Lyza: i don't remember but maybe localhost is unrestricted, anyway you probably make it so and then use a proxy (ssh i guess) to connect to your node
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Lyza	[14:32:27] ok yeah that's an idea
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Lyza	[14:34:50] I think maybe with more light wallets connecting via p2p port now days, it would be good to have some built in whitelisting / auth options for p2p
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[15:46:51] hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:47:56] Sure
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[15:48:06] So who is right>?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	DeanGuss	[15:48:11] "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:48:14] You of course
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:48:32] It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:50:37] I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	DeanGuss	[15:50:51] specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:50:56] That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[15:51:04] i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[15:51:05] [14:59]
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[15:51:05] While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:52:19] Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:52:32] And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[15:54:45] yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[15:55:40] while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:57:42] He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:58:07] Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:58:26] (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:58:54] Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ghost43	[15:59:24] miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ghost43	[15:59:24] or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[15:59:36] He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:59:38] (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[15:59:43] That's okay
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ghost43	[16:00:20] lol
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[16:00:26] Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[16:00:50] So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ghost43	[16:03:26] Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bugs_	[16:03:51] nice :-)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[16:04:34] yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Kinars	[16:06:01] i keep that site in the bookmarks ghost43 ;)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[16:06:07] ghost43: Hopefully the energy section has an article explaining why it needs to use more energy, the more the better.  (obviously "waste" is subjective, so I don't care much about those)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[16:07:40] (I don't blame people for not undertanding this.  bitcoin is basically a combination of just about every topic that just about everyone doesn't understand, even the people in those topic fields, lol)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[16:08:54] (I.e. money, cryptography, distributed systems, and everything subordinate to those topics)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frank2	[18:28:26] If nothing wrong went with the BSV hack, why cant you buy BSV any places :hmm:
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[19:19:42] what's a BSV? :>
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[19:19:47] and who cares?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[19:26:46] BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. Which is a scam from Wright
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[19:27:04] So nobody should care. If you care go for BCH
2021-07-20 11:29:00	as2333	[19:32:28] Bitcoin Shit V
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[19:35:32] Five
2021-07-20 11:29:00	s17	[19:36:19] CSW "knows" Satoshi's Vision, because he is Satoshi
2021-07-20 11:29:00	as2333	[19:44:05] bitcoin shit five yes =)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frank2	[19:44:08] BTC is the real deal?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frank2	[19:44:11] in this chan atleast
2021-07-20 11:29:00	frank2	[19:44:13] :p
2021-07-20 11:29:00	as2333	[19:45:25] ...on the other hand, wright 'owns' the 'copyright' for the btc whitepaper. The Law Says So.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[19:45:54] General note: as2333 is a highly toxic user. I advise keeping clear of him.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[19:54:35] s17: That is bulls*t. Wright isn't Satoshi. If you want to proof that, he should just sign a message from the public address/wallet we know is from Satoshi.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[19:55:51] haha yeah the reason he own the copyright ownership is not because is he spreaking the truth. But because Cobra couldn't join, otherwise he is no longer anonymous.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[19:56:53] So the current legal system failed again.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	as2333	[19:58:34] shocking =)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[19:58:46] yeah ><
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[19:59:00] well for the people who didn't follow the news ;)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:07:45] IMO the bigger problem is copyright bullshit
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:07:56] Intellectual property is the problem.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:08:01] It is highly illogical.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:08:14] It is like fighting physics.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:09:35] Setting laws prohibiting information from being copied is bs (except for classified materials).
2021-07-20 11:29:00	as2333	[20:12:03] ah yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	as2333	[20:12:13] 'classified materials' must be protected
2021-07-20 11:29:00	as2333	[20:12:20] the pentagon says so
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:12:34] Whether classified materials should exist (or not) is another question.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:12:47] I'm not claiming they should exist. I believe in open government.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	as2333	[20:13:03] k
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:13:44] I believe in open government on the blockchain.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:14:21] If some government engineer were to build a new weapon, I don't want to take a strong position of whether that should be classified or not.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[20:24:39] I just host a bitcoin.org mirror
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[20:25:05] (with the whitepaper hosted)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:27:31] There are a 1000 mirrors for it. What would be interesting is if someone took CW to court.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evolver	[20:28:08] and played it better than Cobra
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[20:29:44] that's right
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[20:29:50] somebody needs to stand up!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	danger89	[20:30:16] so Cobra can sleep again
2021-07-20 11:29:00	amanr	[23:36:01] hey! I am starting off to understand how miniscript works (policy -> miniscript <-> bitcoin script), and I want to atleast get intutions as to why the design decisions for the language were made. I have had an introductory experience with Bitcoin Script, but I am still not really confident in it. Any resources I should follow for the same ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	amanr	[23:36:23] For miniscript, I'm mostly following the sipa blog for referencing (back and forth) and understanding

2021-07-20 11:29:00	tarsier	[23:47:55] is there a way to do trustless mining pools?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ufotofu_	[01:58:07] check out p2pool
2021-07-20 11:29:00	negan	[08:09:59] are there any android mining apps?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	retrosenator	[08:10:38] why would there be
2021-07-20 11:29:00	negan	[08:11:48] curiosity
2021-07-20 11:29:00	HeySteve	[08:12:05] there are plenty of scam ones
2021-07-20 11:29:00	retrosenator	[08:12:18] what would be the point?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	retrosenator	[08:12:23] curious people dont use androi
2021-07-20 11:29:00	negan	[08:12:25] yeah a quick search clued me in on that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	negan	[08:12:54] just to see the process run, not expecting to make money at it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	jasan	[09:27:22] negan: You can run a whole bitcoin core in a chroot on Android and you can (play-)mine there using generatetoaddr.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	jasan	[09:28:43] negan: Yes, for learning it is important to grasp it. Set up a regtest with at least two nodes and start mining on it with cpuminer (minerd) that can run even on Android...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	retrosenator	[09:31:22] anyone used openbazaar?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	jasan	[10:08:44] achow101: Thank you for the fix in #22461!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	darosior	[12:47:07] amanr: there is only the miniscript website that i know of. Also feel free to join ##miniscript to ask for specifics

2021-07-20 11:29:00	chazy	[13:31:15] hi, would it be possible to use bitcoin-qt graphical interface with a full node in another host? i mean make the wallet bit connect to a remote full node
2021-07-20 11:29:00	muhkey	[13:33:30] afaik no
2021-07-20 11:29:00	muhkey	[13:33:43] you need electrum style wallet for that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	chazy	[13:38:07] ok so i want to move the full node from my workstation (which is not always powered on) to a headless server, i guess all i need is to run the daemon and that's it? https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/bitcoin-daemon/
2021-07-20 11:29:00	muhkey	[13:45:40] if you want to then access your node remotely I think you will need an electrum server
2021-07-20 11:29:00	muhkey	[13:45:41] https://electrum.org/#home
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[14:02:48] chazy: You can use the RPC system to do that but any actions you take will be done to and on that node
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[14:03:34] So atm you can't have a wallet only bitcoin-qt that uses information from a remote note, making a wallet will make it on that node's machine
2021-07-20 11:29:00	earnestly	[14:03:41] This may change with --multiprocess, not sure
2021-07-20 11:29:00	chazy	[14:04:38] hmm i think what i want are 2 different things, one to move/host the full node from my workstation to a headless remote server and to move the wallets to a lightweight client
2021-07-20 11:29:00	chazy	[15:54:26] would there be any difference between -daemon and ctrl-z + bg?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Diablo-D3	[15:55:44] why not just daemon it to begin with?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	chazy	[17:18:23] is it possible to have wallets with a full node in a headless server? (no bitcoin-qt)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evanito[m]	[17:21:09] Seriously, use the electrum server
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Evanito[m]	[17:21:22] It will do exactly what you are looking for
