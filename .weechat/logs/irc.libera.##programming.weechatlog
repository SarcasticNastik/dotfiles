2021-07-14 20:55:56	xerxes	pulse: i don't think i would like it. most British comedies tend to be too highbrow for me to be funny. i hate Monty Python. i don't know what's the deal with it.
2021-07-14 20:56:07	pulse	allo allo is brilliant
2021-07-14 20:56:18	pulse	it's just impossibly good
2021-07-14 20:56:27	pulse	still, i like seinfeld more. but i think allo allo is a 2nd
2021-07-14 20:56:38	pulse	monty python is mostly an acquired taste tbh
2021-07-14 20:56:45	pyzozord	GeDaMo: yeah looks like something up my lane :D I'm that big on horror and gore movies tbh, but if a movie is good then it's good
2021-07-14 20:56:45	pulse	it's british humor turned to 11
2021-07-14 20:57:08	GeDaMo	Apparently there are a whole lot of sequels to Tremors but I've never seen them
2021-07-14 20:57:10	xerxes	pulse: once i had to sit through a Monty Python movie. that was not a good experience. i didn't find anything funny. clever, yeah. but not funny.
2021-07-14 20:57:14	GeDaMo	The original is excellent though
2021-07-14 20:57:19	pulse	i'm pretty sure allo' allo would offend modern audiences though
2021-07-14 20:57:23	pulse	it's not very politically correct
2021-07-14 20:57:30	pulse	in fact it makes fun of almost every single politically correct thing in existence
2021-07-14 20:57:41	pulse	but it does so in a humorous way
2021-07-14 20:57:54	xerxes	pulse: Seinfeld had exceptionally brilliant actors in George and Kramer.
2021-07-14 20:58:08	pulse	xerxes, all 4 were great, and not only that, all supporting cast was great too
2021-07-14 20:58:16	pulse	the guy who played mr. peterman cracks me up
2021-07-14 20:58:21	pulse	or jackie chiles
2021-07-14 20:58:29	pulse	and newman. god, newman
2021-07-14 20:58:30	xerxes	pulse: Jerry was not a very good actor.
2021-07-14 20:58:36	pulse	xerxes, that only makes it funnier imo
2021-07-14 20:58:40	pulse	he played himself
2021-07-14 20:58:42	xerxes	pulse: Newman's character was the best.
2021-07-14 20:58:48	pulse	yeah newman was fantastic
2021-07-14 20:59:11	pulse	i mean the chemistry in seinfeld is just above and beyond what you usually find in any show
2021-07-14 20:59:25	xerxes	pulse: unlike other sitcoms, there are very few jokes which are forced in Seinfeld.
2021-07-14 20:59:39	pulse	it all just fits together. everyone's neurotic, it's a perfect caricature of modern society
2021-07-14 20:59:42	xerxes	pulse: everything fits.

2021-07-14 21:28:47	pulse	not that mr. robot is entirely bad, some scenes cracked me up
2021-07-14 21:29:07	xerxes	pulse: if i would have to pretend to be an activist, i'd read some crackpot anarchist magazines and show up at a local protest. not binge watch some stupid TV and put pronouns in my Twitter bios.
2021-07-14 21:29:11	pulse	and some hacking scenes were interesting, but seen on the whole, i didn't like it all that much

2021-07-14 21:30:44	pulse	xerxes, yes, it fetishizes gore
2021-07-14 21:30:53	pulse	so if you're into that, GoT is great :p

2021-07-14 23:17:31	bihtori	I would have needed to install xcode or something but I solved it by... running that code on Windows.
2021-07-14 23:19:05	bihtori	Some obscure experimental QGIS plugin depended on PIL and it was 3 hours of failure to get it run it on Mac, so I switched over to Windows.

2021-07-14 23:19:55	dan01	yitz: but yeah, you're right I remember if you want to uninstall TeX from mac it's a pain in the butt, because it's not system managed, as opposed to apt remove ....
2021-07-14 23:20:17	yitz	Package managers make managing packages easy :)

2021-07-14 23:20:25	dan01	how come Apple doesn't have an official package manager I wonder?
2021-07-14 23:20:35	yitz	But that means that package management needs to be done via package managers

2021-07-14 23:21:47	bihtori	There is some thing called "wheels" in Python world that I'm not sure what they are exactly, but I think they are binaries for given architectures and OS's.
2021-07-14 23:22:21	yitz	pip and venv and all that?

2021-07-14 23:42:02	CuriousErnestBro	programmers are opinionated
2021-07-14 23:42:20	CuriousErnestBro	it sucks that they are often wrong and present their misguided opinions as fact to beginners
2021-07-14 23:42:30	CuriousErnestBro	also their value judgements are often completely out of wack

2021-07-14 23:50:10	InPhase	CuriousErnestBro: Good demo of your description.  ;)
2021-07-14 23:52:10	InPhase	CuriousErnestBro: If you perhaps say things like "Some" in front of opinions like that, then your statement would not be provably wrong.  It takes only the existence of one programmer who is not opinionated for everything you said to be incorrect.  And more than one such programmer exists.

2021-07-14 23:54:49	InPhase	CuriousErnestBro: Some is easy, but doesn't say much.  Many says you think it is a lot.  Too many is a value judgment, that you think it should be a smaller number.  "Most" is a stronger statement about a population, which can be counterargued if people think the distribution is different.  But declarations about all are almost always just wrong in large numbers of people.
