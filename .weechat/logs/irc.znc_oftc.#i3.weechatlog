2021-07-18 18:09:53	plitter	Sometimes I'm getting errors when I'm messing around with my i3 config, but I make mistake and I get an error. When I press the "show errors" button, it opens vim and starts reading from  stdin, but it never stops ... how can I make it show the error? The "edit config" opens the config file in vim, but is it possible for it to start with the errors in a quickfix list?

2021-07-20 10:40:40	serhat	[08:38:12] Hello
2021-07-20 10:40:40	serhat	[08:38:31] Is anyone there? I need help about i3-gaps.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	serhat	[08:39:28] hello
2021-07-20 10:40:40	amanr	[11:10:39] hey! I'm a complete newb too but I can try.
2021-07-20 10:40:40	amanr	[11:10:50] I currently use i3-gaps
2021-07-20 10:40:40	amanr	[11:10:58] What's the query
2021-07-20 10:40:40	plitter	[12:36:14] He has quit :) 
2021-07-20 10:40:40	plitter	[12:39:53] Sometimes I'm getting errors when I'm messing around with my i3 config, but I make mistake and I get an error. When I press the "show errors" button, it opens vim and starts reading from  stdin, but it never stops ... how can I make it show the error? The "edit config" opens the config file in vim, but is it possible for it to start with the errors in a quickfix list?
2021-07-20 10:40:40	peder	[08:03:25] plitter: that dialog uses i3-sensible-pager for showing and i3-sensible-editor for editing the file, no reading from stdin at all
2021-07-20 10:40:40	peder	[08:04:05] i3-sensible-pager tries $PAGER less most w3m pg and then i3-sensible-editor i that order
2021-07-20 10:40:40	peder	[08:05:28] and i3-sensible-editor will try $VISUAL, $EDITOR, nano, nvim, vim, vi, emacs, pico, qe, mg, jed, gedit, mcedit and gvim
