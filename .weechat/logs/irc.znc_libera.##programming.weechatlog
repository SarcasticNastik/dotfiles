2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[18:44:21] Also technically speaking, I should be able to mail people under my isp?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	GeDaMo	[18:44:59] I don't know what you mean by "under my isp"
2021-07-17 04:19:38	GeDaMo	[18:45:17] As long as you can open a socket you can try to send an email to an SMTP server
2021-07-17 04:19:38	GeDaMo	[18:45:28] You can even do it manually with telnet
2021-07-17 04:19:38	GeDaMo	[18:45:40] Assuming the server doesn't reject it, that is :P
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[18:47:09] Yay! Another day, another medium leetcode problem solved! All by myslef!
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[18:47:18] that is 4 day streek now!
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[18:49:15] so happy with myself, I guess I can leetcode now a bit
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[18:49:33] not too much though, absolutly not good time to get cocky
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[18:49:51] it's been so much sweat and tears with this thing
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[18:50:22] GeDaMo: I mentioned that because I was thinking of nat
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[18:51:10] pyzozord: Congrats :)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[18:52:22] Izem: thanks :)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	GeDaMo	[18:52:25] Ah, that I don't know about
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[18:53:13] why is it that you can use telnet to try to manually craft some protocols?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[18:53:34] telnet is just made to make a terminal work over the network right?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	GeDaMo	[18:54:07] telnet opens a socket and allows you to type to the remote machine
2021-07-17 04:19:38	GeDaMo	[18:54:24] A lot of older protocols are built the same way
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[18:55:40] I see
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[18:56:15] so can you do the same thing with netcat? iirc that allows you to open arbitrary tcp and udp connections
2021-07-17 04:19:38	quippy	[18:56:23] yes
2021-07-17 04:19:38	GeDaMo	[18:56:25] Yeah, that should work too
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[18:58:00] cool =)

2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:01:46] jeaye, some people are philosophers
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:01:53] Its a valid field of study
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:02:14] But I contend mathematics and programming are not fields that require it
2021-07-17 04:19:38	jeaye	[19:02:43] Why are you pinging me about this?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:02:54] Are you a philosopher?

2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:03:47] Some topics are more suited to philosophy than to programming/math
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:03:59] mathAndRhetorics, very auspicious timing
2021-07-17 04:19:38	mathAndRhetorics	[19:04:05] why?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:04:28] I was just thinking about philosophy and whether/how much it should have a role in mathematics
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:04:39] The immediate cause for my contemplation was the axiom of choice
2021-07-17 04:19:38	mathAndRhetorics	[19:04:45] :)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	mathAndRhetorics	[19:05:04] ##math-offtopic is a great channel for that
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:05:50] mathAndRhetorics, my immediate view as of now is I am not a philosopher
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:06:17] And I think it is more useful to take a stance of practicality than one of philosophy/theology in mathematics
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:06:55] After all, mathematics has had centuries of fruitful development without theological debate about the aoc
2021-07-17 04:19:38	mathAndRhetorics	[19:07:15] on Windows 10, I've coded client/server socket apps in Java. The server accepts a connection and reads. The client connects to the server and sends bytes using BufferedOutputStream. Any ideas why a benchmark shows that 100_000 messages takes 3s, and another day, same code, same computer, shows that it's for example 10 seconds?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:07:56] What else is running? You don't have to answer, even if nothing else was, Windows 10 has a thing where it randomly shoots up disk and sometimes cpu usage.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:08:03] Due to some internal services
2021-07-17 04:19:38	mathAndRhetorics	[19:17:44] I have to reboot. There is some Windows Update stuff, it seems.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	psydroid	[19:18:29] it does that all by itself
2021-07-17 04:19:38	beaky	[19:19:27] nice i like rebooting my computer always feels faster after a quick reboot why is that
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:19:41] psydroid, does what all by itself
2021-07-17 04:19:38	psydroid	[19:20:10] it is magic
2021-07-17 04:19:38	tarsier	[19:23:54] beaky: RAM fragmentation
2021-07-17 04:19:38	tarsier	[19:23:59] kidding, i just made that up
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:25:58] Well, a lot of things get reset in after a reboot right?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[19:26:32] on windows? probably some bloated "cache"

2021-07-17 04:19:38	tarsier	[19:27:49] just want to share my interview experience thus far again :)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	tarsier	[19:28:16] do you also think the interview process is excessive?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:29:27] tarsier: are you the person who have been having an interview for few weeks now for a android dev?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:29:47] *a number of interviews
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:30:22] ah yes that's you, sorry you change your nick so often I lose track
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:30:41] How come there's not a lot of windows clones today?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:30:55] Did microsoft prevent people from making them early on?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:30:57] beaky: placebo? ;) or you are on windows
2021-07-17 04:19:38	piou	[19:31:21] How do you define a windows clone?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	tarsier	[19:31:32] pyzozord: yeah I had to change it because people keep asking me if I'm brazillian
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:31:43] tarsier: I don't know for sure, but ram fragmentation does sound like a thing that actually happens
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[19:31:46] izem because wine has existed for basically ever
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[19:32:06] and VM's have had a good run
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:34:09] well, I'm thinking about vendors who want to sell PC hardware
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[19:34:15] also ask yourself "how come there's not another x11 implementation besides XOrg"
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:34:46] iirc openbsd has one?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[19:35:04] do they still use xfree 86?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:35:05] different question anyways
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:35:25] no, something else
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[19:35:25] the answer is the same though
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[19:36:38] wiki says xenocara is customized XOrg
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[19:39:53] and xenocara.org says "it is not a fork"
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:40:40] have you ever noticed how bugs are actually manifestation of your model of understanding the problem or environment being incorrect?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:40:54] or typos
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:41:51] bugs could be anything
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:42:03] I think fixing bugs is strangly one of the most fun / easiest thing about the job
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:42:06] just see the story of why it's called a bug anyways
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:42:39] supposedly because there was a fly in eniac, but I heard that they actually called them bug even before that event
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:43:34] "The term "bug" to describe defects has been a part of engineering jargon since the 1870s and predates electronic computers and computer software"
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:43:44] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:44:11] wikipedia is not that authorative of a source but I guess it's better than anything I have to say
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:46:07] oh, well I was refering to the bug in the computer :P
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:47:06] still, I'd much rather have that issue than the bug being poor code
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:48:54] Izem: actually when I think about it, hunting the physical "bug" wouldn't be all that different from hunting a software one
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[19:49:18] well maybe except if the bug was alive, that would complicate things
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[19:54:04] you sure would be shocked, since the answer isn't in software :P
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pikapika	[19:54:45] Hardware was large back then
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[20:02:44] Izem: also could be shocked when trying to remove the bug out of the circutry :D
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:22:52] Do ip-location based security methods make any sense?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:24:55] It's annoying for me and makes it hard to get into my accounts
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:31:34] Izem: For people who are careful with their passwords, and keep secure systems such that its unlikely for their passwords to be remotely compromised, it doesn't make too much sense.  But for people who live in the other state of being, where their passwords end up compromised by hackers running botnets, this provides a safeguard.  The botnets work at such a scale that this probably makes up the
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:31:40] majority of compromises that the larger institutions have to deal with.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:32:30] I see, I did not think of botnets
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:32:53] it's also a bit of a problem with vpns
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:33:15] and the fact that they are kinda telling you that you are easily identifiable :P
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:33:20] Izem: I personally prefer when accounts let me disable all forms of 2 factor authentication.  I've been on the Internet for 27 years and never had a password of mine compromised.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:33:44] I like 2 factor auth with OTP as an option
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:33:49] everthing else sucks
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:34:12] especially for me who's has 3 phone numbers in 4 years :/
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:34:27] InPhase: what do you use?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:34:37] For?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:34:43] password management
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:35:06] Local encryption plus effective human memory.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:35:15] heh
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:35:33] disk encrption is risky for someone like me, no way
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:36:03] Because?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:36:33] if I forget that password, it will impossible to get my data back
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:36:42] Well don't do that!
2021-07-17 04:19:38	blahboybaz	[20:36:45] Are you supposed to call a class variable a field or a property in javascript?  I've been looking at articles and documentation but I"m still not sure what the correct answer it
2021-07-17 04:19:38	 *	Izem [20:37:09] checks mdn
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:37:21] Izem: Although if you don't trust your memory of your master password, you can write it down and hide it somewhere as a backup.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:37:25] i'm still astonished javascript has classes
2021-07-17 04:19:38	blahboybaz	[20:37:54] prototypical language
2021-07-17 04:19:38	blahboybaz	[20:38:07] still can do oo even w/o them
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:38:09] Izem: If someone steals your hard drive and rummages through your house and finds your hidden master password, you probably have much bigger problems to worry about than your online accounts.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:38:32] blahboybaz: objects have properties, classes have fields
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:38:48] InPhase: xD
2021-07-17 04:19:38	InPhase	[20:39:24] Izem: Or you could store your password in public.  For example, take the third letter of the first 20 words in the Gettysburg Address.  (But don't do that, because I just said it publicly.)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	blahboybaz	[20:39:42] Izem: And they look different too right? If I'm not mistaken a field has a colon ":" after it right?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:39:50] that is a great idea
2021-07-17 04:19:38	blahboybaz	[20:40:03] A field looks more like json
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:40:58] when they added classes, why didn't theyjust commandeer the Java9tm) terminology
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:41:00] not sure about the field, but you are still talking about properties
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:41:07] Java(tm)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:41:41] properties are key value pairs
2021-07-17 04:19:38	blahboybaz	[20:42:36] An instance of a class is an object. So the class definition has fields but when you instantiate it (you get an object) that intstantiated object how has "properties"?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:42:43] ultimately I suspect a class is a special version of a property, though I did not look into it
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:43:07] Java is not JavaScript, beware
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:43:18] or vice versa
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:43:44] society has approved of the name discrependcy though
2021-07-17 04:19:38	blahboybaz	[20:44:04] hmm..
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:44:34] I can use screen and docker at the same time right?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:44:34] yeah, the popular oop languages all have (slightly) different terminology
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:44:46] CuriousErnestBro: yeah
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:44:49] can I also use systemctl with docker?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:45:03] yes?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:45:05] curiousernestobro you need /dev/ptmx device
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:45:15] inside docker or outside?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:45:17] and /dev/pts
2021-07-17 04:19:38	blahboybaz	[20:45:27] Well I guess it isn't that big a deal. I was thinking about writhng my test description using the correct terminology. Who know's maybe someon else would see later and think I'm an idiot that doesn't know the differnece  :p
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:45:42] otherwise it can't multiplex the tty device, for ioctl to work
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:46:48] blahboybaz: if you aren't working on the compiler then I guess you would establish that as part of the docs
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:47:17] wat.jpg
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:47:22] ehnet3d what are you talking about?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:47:35] screen, the terminal multiplexer. what are you talking about?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:47:37] Izem to launch docker
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:47:55] what is /dev/ptmx and /pts?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:48:02] terminal device files
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:48:05] for multiplexing
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:48:23] pseudoterminal
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:48:45] why do I need that?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:48:55] to run screen....
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:49:13] I can run screen without it
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:49:32] without /dev/prmx /dev/pts?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:49:44] I don't know what those are, so I probably haven't used them
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:50:17] if you run screen, you use them.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:50:35] ok.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:50:49] I don't get your point
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:51:18] you asked if you can do X, i answered with what you need to have available for X to work.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:51:46] oh
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:52:19] that wasn't the point of the question, I wanted to know if doing screen -S somename and then docker -v ..... was going to work or not
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:52:38] so I can hit control-a d and then log off
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:52:51] you should have asked that, instead of vaguely asking what you asked instead.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[20:52:51] yeah I don't see why not
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:53:23] yeah probably
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:53:32] asking questions is hard
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:53:45] good questions at least
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:54:47] also chosing the right place to ask, this is a programming channel so i'm focusing more on programming answers. like the implementation details
2021-07-17 04:19:38	ehnet3d	[20:55:01] that was more of a general system administration question
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:58:10]  thanks and sorry
2021-07-17 04:19:38	CuriousErnestBro	[20:58:12] continue on
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:09:28] what is the virtual in vpn?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:09:56] Is that due to how it was first used?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	dodo	[21:12:06] i guess private networks were initially local ones. as vpn traffic crosses other networks it's not "really" private, hence virtual
2021-07-17 04:19:38	dodo	[21:12:21] could probably have been an overlay pn too or somesuch
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:13:45] well I assume there is some security layer?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	dodo	[21:13:56] sure
2021-07-17 04:19:38	dodo	[21:14:16] but you can still get info, like bandwidth, times of traffic etc
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:14:47] also, how is that related to what is being sold as vpns now (to non business)
2021-07-17 04:19:38	dodo	[21:15:16] it's the same tech
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:15:29] cause the stuff that is being sold, I don't get the feeling I can use it as my own network for my friends say
2021-07-17 04:19:38	dodo	[21:15:46] it's not. it's $company's network, their private network
2021-07-17 04:19:38	dodo	[21:16:01] but you can set up your own vpn if you want
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:16:21] yeah, I'm thinking about that
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:16:46] I want to get an rpi, but I might have to get two :P
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:17:02] this wiregaurd stuff looks cool
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:18:44] though I'd still have to rent space in a server room otherwise I don't get the nice benefit of having different ips
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:19:25] Does nat matter if you use ipv6?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:19:52] I don't think so based on my understanding, wonder how isps handle security here
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:23:49] the big networks nowadays are for phone, atm, and internet?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:23:56] I wonder what else
2021-07-17 04:19:38	pyzozord	[21:28:24] phone and internet are those going through the same cables really?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	Izem	[21:28:52] I dunno, good question
2021-07-17 04:19:38	quippy	[21:33:44] most of the time, in the modern world, yes
2021-07-17 04:19:38	quippy	[21:34:02] I'm pretty sure most phone providers have switched to VOIP and everything is just on the same fiber backhauls these days
2021-07-17 04:19:38	quippy	[21:34:10] probably in rural areas there are still copper phone lines
2021-07-17 04:19:38	powerhouse_	[21:46:10] Any idea why the paypal button isnt showing on this page https://termbin.com/u7u4
2021-07-17 04:19:38	powerhouse_	[21:46:11] ?

2021-07-17 04:19:38	DPA	[22:02:56] I made a tic-tac-toe browser game without any JS, but now I don't know what to do with it: https://dpa.li/tic-tac-toe.html
2021-07-17 04:19:38	DPA	[22:06:08] Also, does anyone know any other good static html online games without any JS?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	immibis	[22:42:25] you could brag on ##programming, /r/programming, or hacker news
2021-07-17 04:19:38	mathAndRhetorics	[22:42:50] I've tried rebooting and checked cpu usage. It's low. Here is my simple Java code: https://pastebin.com/KT33Lkim It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow?
2021-07-17 04:19:38	immibis	[22:44:36] Izem: it is much more convenient to rent either actual servers or VPSes. There are many companies that will sell you monthly or even hourly access to a server that's just for you.
2021-07-17 04:19:38	immibis	[22:45:20] Izem: if you want just a little bit of computing power (and modern computers are fast, so a little slice of one is often good enough) you can rent a VPS, or virtual private server, which is just a virtual machine on a server, and you own the virtual machine
2021-07-17 04:19:38	immibis	[22:46:30] those go down to about $5/month - for that price you will get something like 0.5GB-1GB of RAM, 5GB-10GB disk space, 1 virtual CPU core (that's actually shared with some other VPSes, so you're only guaranteed maybe 0.25 of a CPU core), enough internet

2021-07-17 05:35:54	ross	[23:56:09] I'm using it to store the 'one' of a one-to-many relationship, except in optimising my table I realise that the 'one' doesn't actually need any properties other than what it contained in the 'many' table
2021-07-17 05:35:54	beaky	[23:56:15] the axiom of choice is an axiom that is highly controversial in mathematics https://jaydaigle.net/blog/what-is-the-axiom-of-choice/ but in dependent type theory it is not an axiom but a theorem so what is it that makes it both necessary for and not controversial in dependent type theory https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/axiom-choice/choice-and-type-theory.html
2021-07-17 05:35:54	arahael	[23:56:46] ross: Sure. :)  I'm not actually a database admin, but that seems quite reasonable to me.
2021-07-17 05:35:54	ross	[23:57:05] reasonable works for me, thanks for your wisdom!

2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:11:21] |smlckz|: Seriously though, just ask here. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:11:49] ross: maybe in principle someone could give specific advice about your database if you can describe it more specifically (i.e. to the point of pasting your schema somewhere)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	guest4389	[00:12:03] is path on windows recursive?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:12:22] guest4389: Potentially.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:13:01] oldlaptop: thanks for your (implied?) offer, but my schema is still in flux atm, and a little reassurance was all I was looking for :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	|smlckz|	[00:13:02] okay, groff is ignoring the redefinition of some macros, works fine in heirloom troff and mandoc.. what can i do?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	guest4389	[00:13:57] arahael: potentially? it's not by default? im saving all my libraries in C:\Users\name\lib\
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:14:02] ross: We often give advice to help the *community* here engage and answer the questions.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:15:23] oldlaptop: What's your timezone, out of curiosity? You seem to be on when I'm on.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:15:29] arahael: could you clarify what you mean by that in this specific scenario? do you suggest I re-ask my question with details anyway for the sake of improving and/or engaging in community discussion even if I don't have a specific problem?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:15:31] I mean, I'm not a database admin either, I just write everything in sqlite.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:15:37] sqlite ftw
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:15:44] sqlite is awesome.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:15:50] arahael: GMT-4 at the moment, because the politicians think that's better than GMT-5 in the summer
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:15:54] sqlite is awesome.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:16:00] oldlaptop: Oh, wow.  I'm GMT+10.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	[R]	[00:16:07] sqlite is amazing if you don't care about the fact that you can throw 8GB of text into an INT column
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:16:14] I'm using it for the new iteration of my work's logistics system.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:16:15] using sqlite in client-side JS atm and it's not even close to being the biggest js bundle I've pushed to users
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:16:16] amazing
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:16:21] To replace a giant CSV file.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	|smlckz|	[00:16:35] sorry, not some, but all redefinitions.. groff man's manpage says, it may ignore redefinitions of macros, what to do now?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:16:44] [R]: (you can't throw 8GB of text into any column, IIRC)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:16:55] *I didn't choose how the data was stored last year, I just had to turn it into optimised routes.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	[R]	[00:17:27] oldlaptop: sqlite doesn't do type checking
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:17:33] I noticed.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:17:44] You don't always _need_ type checking.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:18:35] ross: It really depends on what you want, oldlaptop was just suggesting how you might get more advice on the higher level design. But if you only wanted to know that low-level specific detail, then that's fine.  You seem to be competent here, so I'm not worried - but others are known to be very susceptable to X-Y questions: Ask and worry about X, when their real question and concern is Y.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:19:06] ross: It's mostly to catch X-Y questions that people ask for more context.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:19:10] oh I'm sure I'm not yet good enough to guarantee that I'm not inadvertently XYing
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:19:44] I'm not sure anyone really is
2021-07-17 15:00:02	guest4389	[00:20:36] i found it. it's not recursive.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Izem	[00:20:52] immibis: thanks for the advice
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:21:56] guest4389: There's a few different definitions for "recursive".
2021-07-17 15:00:02	[R]	[00:22:41] Thedarkb-Desktop: Having a language that strongly type checks and an implimentation that doesn't at all, is not a feature
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:23:04] It's not a feature, but it's something you can live with.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:23:04] hi all! apropos of nothing, I have a question about sql db design. part of my app involves the user creating Conditions, which are a series of condition terms, where an individual condition term is either a function or an operator. operators are things like AND, OR, NOT. I'm storing condition terms in their own table, and as a result, the parent 'conditions' table doesn't actually contain anything other than a primary key. is this a good practice?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:23:05] https://bpa.st/7EGA
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:23:24] guest4389: Consider you might have a subdirectory that actually places you in a parent directory, and as you keep recursing, you'll do that forever.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	guest4389	[00:23:24]  "You need to specify each directory individually, the PATH mechanism doesn't walk through subdirectories."
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:24:03] guest4389: Depending on the API, you might be wanting to look at "globbing" mechanisms.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	beaky	[00:26:14] ross: yes having the 'keys' of the terms on a separate table from the terms themselves is more normalized
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:27:50] ross: maybe I'm missing something, but I'm not sure having the separate conditions table accomplishes anything useful besides making it possible to represent an empty condition
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:28:23] oldlaptop: a condition should be able to be empty, yes - but a condition can contain any number of terms and operators
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:28:42] e.g. the condition `hasItem(pen) AND NOT hasItem(egg)` contains 4 terms
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:28:56] 'any number' includes 0
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:29:12] hence the 1-to-many relationship between conditions and condition terms
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:29:17] the foreign key constraint from conditionTerms requires you to "create" the condition first, but if you don't need empty ones (or you find some excuse to not need empty ones) then you could simply say that a condition exists simply by having a conditionTerm with its ID
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:29:46] I could, but I do need to be sure that an empty condition can exist - when the user creates a new condition, it will necessarily be empty
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:30:48] is it necessary to create the condition, in this sense, at all if the user hasn't added any terms to it? (I suspect the answer is probably yes...)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:31:28] ross: Is the user creating these tables dynamically, effectively? That's also "ok" in sqlite, but I'd probably suggest a more static design if you can fit it well.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:31:39] possibly not? I think it's easier to guarantee that a row in the condition table exists even if the condition is empty rather than attempt to avoid hitting the database if the UI field is empty, perhaps at the cost of a little db space
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:32:09] arahael: no, these tables are fixed - this is the (partial) schema for the save file for a dialogue tree editor
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:32:21] they are creating rows dynamically :P
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:32:43] ross: Ah, good.  Also, regarding "hitting the database", I'd be a bit less concerned about that when it comes to sqlite.  sqlite is that awesome.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:33:03] oh agreed, I'm not worried about performance, just coding complexity lmao
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:33:09] I agree this question is probably not of much practical interest, the conditions table is going to waste, what, eight octets per condition, with a minimum of (if this is sqlite) one page?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:33:11] Cool. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:33:18] arahael: much easier to do things if you can guarantee that something exists, even if it's empty
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:33:52] oldlaptop: perhaps it might be of concern if I am running this on a nokia brick
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:34:04] ross: Some database guys would probably find that problematic "your app's details are leaking into the database", but meh, I think that's perfectly valid when it comes to sqlite. It's an app-side database.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:34:34] the *real* low-hanging fruit for space-waste is the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY in conditionFunctions :P
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:34:42] arahael: that's a good point. I have to admit I'm not well versed in good practices when it comes to 'proper' databases
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:35:21] (even though it's sqlite you could make name the primary key in a WITHOUT ROWID database and save a whole eight octets per row)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:35:30] oldlaptop: it's referred to by the `conditionFunctionArgumentTypes` table, no?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:36:48] Sure, but that could refer to the name instead, in principle. Depending on how long names usually are, that probably cuts into the savings a fair bit
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:37:53] oldlaptop: it could, but I don't like that - were I to update the name of a conditionFunction, I'd then have to iterate over the conditionFunctionArgumentTypes table and ensure that all those names are updated to. I chose to use a db in the first place to avoid having to do this
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:37:53] (I'm still being mostly silly here, I strongly doubt it's worth worrying about)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:38:06] *are updated too
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:38:20] the DB should be able to do that for you
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:38:39] really? interesting
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:39:15] https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:39:21] of course making it do that in the first place is *another* cost
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:40:07] true, true - my instinct is that that would be useful if I wasn't already using integer primary keys?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:40:13] will definitely look into it though!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:40:35] Or if for some reason you wanted to update the integer primary keys, I suppose.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:40:44] funnily enough, I thought the most noteworthy issues with this scheme would be sortIndex and the CHECK constraint in conditionTerms
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:40:50] oldlaptop: oh, I doubt I'd do that
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:40:58] (The usual sort of integer primary key you get in the ISO Standard Database is not the kind of thing that gets updated)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:41:39] agreed, primary keys should be a technical implementation detail imo and not for either the user or the developer to worry about - very much the concern of the db driver and it alone
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:41:50] I don't really like the sortIndex either (that defines the order in which the terms are arranged?), but I can't think of something better offhand either.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:42:19] yes, I did some googling about it and couldn't find a conclusive answer. baffling that it's not, like... an absurdly common problem
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:42:20] I wouldn't write an OR with numeric addition, but it works in sqlite.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:43:11] ah, it's not an OR really - I guess it is an OR in the case with 2 columns
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:43:20] but say 5 columns, and I must guarantee that only 1 is not NULL
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:43:50] here's another part of my schema with 3 such columns https://bpa.st/7IMA
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:43:55] meaning there are other tables not shown here where the sum has more... ah.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:44:40] this is my entire schema so far in all its unfinished glory https://bpa.st/IWJA
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:45:08] going way back to your original question, you could do this with conditionTerms.operator, if you wanted!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:45:08] <arahael> ross: Ie, other tables can have a relation defined that they must map to an item in that table, such that there are a restricted set of options.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:45:15] (the 'conditionals' table at the bottom will be scrapped pending a re-think)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:45:49] yeah, it ultimately depends on just how you need to specify and update that set of options.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:45:51] oldlaptop: this is new vocabulary to me
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:45:59] <table>.operator?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:46:06] oh you mean the column
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:46:08] haha silly me
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:46:13] Yes
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:46:43] yes, I could definitely use an enum for that, and did consider it
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:47:33] You could have something like `CREATE TABLE operators(operator TEXT PRIMARY KEY); INSERT INTO operators VALUES ('and'), ('or'), ('not'), /* whatever */;
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:47:42] but I decided not to on the basis that if my user loads a corrupt schema, or a schema from a future version of the app, with an unknown operator, it would be better for the error message to contain "Unknown operator: XAND" or w/e rather than "Unknown operator" or worse "Unknown operator with ID 4"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:48:09] sorry, db, not schema
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:48:10] which would have the same advantage over the obvious CHECK constraint that it has over the postgres enum types arahael mentioned
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:49:07] Keep in mind the schema goes with the DB
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:49:12] (I guess that error message doesn't really matter as there's no way for the user to actually fix it... that information doesn't help them)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:49:56] if I save a file from rossApp 2.0, which has the new BLORGINATE operator, and open it in rossApp 1.0, the constraints will all still be fine, rossApp 1.0 just isn't going to know what the heck BLORGINATE is
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:50:47] unless you do something really wild, like store the implementation of the operator in the database (goes best with dynamic langauges for obvious reasons)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:51:08] "store the implementation of the operator in the database" - oh boy that sounds like !fun!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:51:57] hmmm. I will consider the enum approach
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:52:00] code gets stored in "real" databases all the time, and a lot of users of "real" databases seem to want sqlite to get its own PL/SQL interpreter or something to do that itself
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:52:12] I admit I don't see any advantage or disadvantage one way or the other (re enums)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:52:27] oldlaptop: that is interesting, will be worth reading about
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:52:38] the search term would be "stored procedures"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:53:09] oldlaptop: yeah, frankly i think sqlite should continue to avoid pl/sql.  people can always settle on whatever scripting language they like and register extensions.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:53:34] for most purposes, sqlite's support for application-defined functions does what you might want them for, and for some other purposes you could dump your code in the database and execute it yourself
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:54:02] arguably better, too, given the circumstances sqlite is used in.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:54:49] I suppose that could be useful in some cases - a db that stores procedures and not data is just another kind of data. can't think of any such cases off the top of my head thoug
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:55:38] I guess you could use a static set of stored procedures to ensure that applications only interact with the db in a certain way, beyond what column constraints can guarantee?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:55:41] in a client/server database it can be very important to have code that executes on the server rather than the client
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:55:59] indeed, but sqlite is not a client/server database.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ross	[00:56:02] ah! true - and you might not have enough need to implement a server-side implementation
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:56:25] there is no such distinction for an embedded database like sqlite, though, so there's no reason (say) a new sql function can't just be application code
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[00:57:12] the remaining irritation is that you can run into trouble if, say, you create a schema that uses some custom function or collation sequence, then try to open it with the sqlite3 command shell or something
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:58:42] i'm not sure i like the idea of having a data format being able to execute arbitruary code, though, so i prefer sqlite as it is.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[00:59:32] eg, if i get a random sqlite file from someone and load it in sqlite3, i wouldnt want it to execute random stuff and install crap.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:00:10] such a pl/sql would need to be sandboxed *very* well.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	 *	oldlaptop [01:01:47] *can* think of a way to (try to) do that, offhand: http://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/safe.htm
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:02:14] IIRC pgTcl or whatever postgres calls its tcl-stored-procedure feature uses safe interps
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:02:59] (of course tcl is a pretty big thing to drag around with sqlite everywhere, and the various stripped-down tcls don't have safetcl)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:03:30] potentially reasonable, but wouldnt be JIT code either, and wouldnt be something you can assume anywhere
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:03:34] *everywhere.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:04:05] iOS would be a bit problematic there too.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:04:21] (depends on how you use it)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:04:41] (one day! https://core.tcl-lang.org/tclquadcode/dir?ci=tip)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:04:52] (llvm is an even bigger thing to drag around with sqlite everywhere)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:05:14] oldlaptop: right, but still wouldnt be on iOS!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:05:37] we don't even have JIT for JS unless you execute within safari's webview.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:06:14] for "hardware" reasons. (ignoring that safari can do it just fine, so clearly the hardware can do it).
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:07:04] Hi, people, etc.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:07:45] arahael: if you want to keep the absurd alternate universe where any of this actually goes into sqlite going, no reason sqlite-plus-tcl-plus-llvm couldn't get the same exemption safari gets
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:07:56] it's a core OS component after all
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:08:49] back in reality, it's a core OS component that ain't never getting "stored procedure" support
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:09:39] oldlaptop: there is that, yes, though you can run javascript core in your own process, you just don't get JIT, so i suspect that similar would happen, then again, pigs can fly, and apple could easily change their mind.  hell, we're getting xcode on ipads soon, maybe.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:10:48] What did I miss?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:11:00] no JIT on appleware???
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:11:02] wow
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:11:40] [context: sqlite does not have stored procedure support, and stored procedure support isn't really desirable; if it were desirable and could exist, it couldn't be implemented with a JIT on iOS)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:11:46] do firefox and chrome have to beg them?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:11:56] {I can't remember which grouping symbols I'm using>
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:12:00] ehnet3d: all web browsers use safari's engine on ios.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:12:06] loooooooool
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:12:48] i really didn't need another reason to never use ios/macos but thanks for another one
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:13:05] macOS is (still, for now) very different in this regard
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:13:13] same company
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:13:19] same radical ideology
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:13:30] you actually can just compile things on it and run them (still, for now)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:14:12] and you can (still, for now, sort of, if you tell users how to bypass the signature checking stuff) even distribute the binaries for people to run
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:14:51] (and even if you can't tell them to bypass signature checking, you can still, for now, sort of, get your own random binary signed and distribute it outside the App Store thingummy.)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:15:37] indeed.  important to realise that apple mainly just does things differently, and in some cases much better. in others, more annoying/frustrating.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:16:01] what do they do that's much better
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:16:12] personally having differences is good. keeps a competition going.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[01:16:26] better restrictions on their users
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:17:14] I'm sure macOS and the other darwin derivatives have their strong points as development platforms. Some people probably liked objc, and some people probably like swift
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:17:35] kind of.  they have been really good on real world privacy lately, eg, forcing facebook to an opt-in model for tracking.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:17:51] They're alleged by fans to be very good at UI design - not so sure about that myself :|
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:18:20] there have been dumb things in apple UIs since the infamous throw-the-floppy-in-the-trash-to-eject-it metaphor
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:18:32] oldlaptop: they are/were very good at that, but lately they've been trying to "hide" clutter, which is annoying and makes discovery harder. :(
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:18:56] ah, heh, yeah. throw the floppy into the trash was bizarre.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:19:38] some of the application UIs in the late '90s made the same sorts of mistakes that were an industry-wide plague around that time (quicktime was a poster child)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:19:49] My father found it unsettling that he had to throw his favorite music in the trash to eject the CD.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:20:25] oldlaptop: fairly consistent within the apple walled garden, at least, though.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:20:49] they were *inconsistent* with everything else on macs at the time, that was part of the industry-wide plague
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:21:01] I think I might need a Catalina VM to see if my OS upgrade broke some of my code.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:21:29] oldlaptop: ah, fair.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:21:46] And if it did, I might need to abandon my project.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	oldlaptop	[01:21:53] subjectively, I don't think iOS/iPadOS as it is now is particularly approachable/intuitive for non-appleites beyond a surface level (but my sample size is not large, though non-one)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:21:53] anyway, just pointing out that it's not bad for apple to push for a different model.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:22:31] vdamewood: sadly, apple does often do that :(
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:22:59] arahael: In apple's defence, I might have been (ab)using a non-public API.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pikapika	[01:23:01] arahael, what do you think of David Hilbert?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:23:04] vdamewood: it's one reason i keep dependencies and code to a minimum - there is a lot of churn :(
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:23:16] pikapika: do i know him?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:23:24] Or rather, a non-public extension of an API.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pikapika	[01:23:25] arahael, do you?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:23:43] pikapika: no?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:23:46] On the other hand, everything works perfectly for PIv6, so maybe I messed something up.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:26:43] IPv6, I mean.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:30:04] probably. but apple.  they did change some of the networking stuff in big sur.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:33:36] Well, to th VM then.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:34:07] And now my dock is showing up over my full screen apps.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[01:36:21] thats why i auto-hide them.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:37:26] Normall, the doc is hidden with full-screen apps.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:37:31] dock*
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:37:38] and normally*
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[01:38:27] Well, this is annoying. I'll be back.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	guest4389	[02:12:20] makefile, cmake or something else? Which do you use and why?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[02:14:22] makefile, easiest to use
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[02:21:24] guest4389: I use pbxproj files.  They're awful.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	guest4389	[02:24:41] pbxproj? Is that for xcode?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[02:25:21] Yep.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	meleoron	[04:21:44] what is a good place to find C reference and standard online?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[04:26:11] soo
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[04:26:18] what are you guys working on right now?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	yitz	[04:27:38] Cookies
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[04:27:47] Oh god I hate cookies
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[04:28:05] but fuck it, I love money, fuck privacy pro google everyone!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	yitz	[04:28:11] Good. I wasn't planning on sharing.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[04:32:54] Why is there 531 people online and so quiet
2021-07-17 15:00:02	alekhine	[04:33:41] Well mark, IRC is usually like that. By the way, your website is horrible and you should be ashamed of what you've done
2021-07-17 15:00:02	yitz	[04:33:52] No one asked an interesting programming-related question for them to chime in on
2021-07-17 15:00:02	meleoron	[04:34:35] what is a good place to find C reference and standard online?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:35:01] I think the finalized C standards still must be paid for
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:35:18] and they are like hidden behind lots of govt beaurocracy
2021-07-17 15:00:02	alekhine	[04:35:28] Damn, in the year 2021?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:35:30] But I think final drafts are available online
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:35:33] for free
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:35:43] Final drafts, not necessarily exactly what went into the published thing
2021-07-17 15:00:02	meleoron	[04:35:45] is the website `https://en.cppreference.com` good as a reference?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:36:40] alekhine, you'd be surprised
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:36:49] I think WLAN standards are paywalled too
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:36:56] and probably have ndas too
2021-07-17 15:00:02	PlanckWalk	[04:38:26] Yeah.  "If you're writing software in this language, pay the tax to us."
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:38:44] Both ISO and IEEE are paywalled
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:38:52] ISO is for C, IEEE is for wlan
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ehnet3d	[04:39:12] maybe you could find the ANSI C89 document somewhere
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:39:35] ANSI is also paid I think, we only get to see the final draft but not the actual publication
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:39:40] which is copyrighted and paid for
2021-07-17 15:00:02	alekhine	[04:39:46] This is why Zig is better than C
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:39:53] and also have to move through some govt labyrinths to actually find how to purchase
2021-07-17 15:00:02	PlanckWalk	[04:40:12] You could read your compiler source code to at least find out how *it* interprets the source code, but it's written in a language that has a paywalled spec too...
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:40:43] I think gcc now uses some C++
2021-07-17 15:00:02	meleoron	[04:41:22] alekhine: i plan to learn Zig, Nim, Rust and friends after i've got an in depth knowledge of C.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	meleoron	[04:41:25] is the website `https://en.cppreference.com` good as a reference?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	PlanckWalk	[04:41:35] Even then you still wouldn't know for sure whether some weird behaviour of the compiler is expected behaviour according to the spec, or a compiler bug.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	meleoron	[04:42:08] PlanckWalk: with popular compilers, one can be reasonably sure that bugs won't be easy to find.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:42:15] Most of the documents you find online are the final drafts
2021-07-17 15:00:02	PlanckWalk	[04:42:20] It's probably safest to assume that 99% of all software written in these languages is full of bugs anyway, but at least it wouldbe nice to be able to *prove* it.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:42:27] Which may not be exactly identical to the finally published and paywalled document
2021-07-17 15:00:02	david_hilbert	[04:42:36] but we can reasonably expect it would match almost wholly
2021-07-17 15:00:02	PlanckWalk	[04:43:01] Yep.  if you need to *know* then you have to pay.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	meleoron	[04:44:20] i suppose ISO holds copyright on the text of the standard.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:03:20] if you have unlimited time and money
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:03:29] what would you work on?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	PlanckWalk	[05:04:40] Finding out how to get unlimited time and money to everyone else.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	ChromaCat248	[05:05:46] just made my first commit to my window manager project in over a month
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:06:55] Most people spend most of their life finding out how to get unlimited time and money
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:06:58] and sometimes it comes
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:07:06] markzuckerberg: I'd probably work on my family tree project. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:07:08] and none of us really thought about how to keep it
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:07:35] arahael that's amazing, I've seen someone do it, it dated way way back
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:07:55] markzuckerberg: The hard part is avoiding bias, though.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:08:04] markzuckerberg: You have very limited evidence and it can be interpreted many ways.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:08:19] ChromaCat248 just have to keep committing consistently
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:08:31] just like we show up to work everyday
2021-07-17 15:00:02	 *	arahael [05:08:56] doesn't show up at work every day!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:08:59] arahael cursed problem? how do we avoid it, or is it impossible
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:09:13] arahael you have to, it compounds
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:09:20] just show up, no matter how late
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:09:20] markzuckerberg: I work from home.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	markzuckerberg	[05:09:24] oh
2021-07-17 15:00:02	edgar-rft	[05:11:31] arahael: if you're working from home then show up at work as soon as you wake up :-)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:11:58] Ha.  Actually no, I make a point of *not* doing any work until I properly start.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:12:17] One trap of working from home is always being "switched on" for work.  Have to really avoid that otherwise you go insane.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:12:39] Oh, fun. Just discovered a new plant allergy. :(
2021-07-17 15:00:02	edgar-rft	[05:13:08] every day someting new :-)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:13:24] My skin is seriously blistering up!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:13:51] It's pretty amazing.  Super-itchy, though. :(  The plant is pumpkin.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	edgar-rft	[05:14:21] you're allergic against helloween?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	blahboybaz	[05:21:27] Are there any caveats to defining a function like: let f = () => return something;  (using an arrow function) rather then like: let f = function(){return something;}  or  function f(){return something;}  What I mean is can there be a difference show up when you use it later that affect the caller in some way you need to know about?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	blahboybaz	[05:21:39] for javascript

2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[05:22:30] edgar-rft: No, pumpkins themselves are delicious.  I think it's just the prickles on the plant itself.

2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[07:01:46] blahboybaz: not that I know of, the this inside the arrow functions (aka closures) behaves different, but that's the whole point. Generally they are used very interchangably, many devs just prefer arrowfunctions and use exlusively only them

2021-07-17 15:00:02	CoderGuy	[07:43:39] are the properties of a gui class that have to do with style/display the style properties?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[07:46:31] Speaking of arrows, I'm trying to learn them in haskell.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[07:46:41] CoderGuy: They can be.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	CoderGuy	[07:46:59] hmm okay cool
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[07:47:05] CoderGuy: You'll want to check the docs for the GUI framework you're using for their terminology and definitions.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	CoderGuy	[07:47:17] oh i'm creating my own
2021-07-17 15:00:02	CoderGuy	[07:47:20] I just wanted to know what to name it
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[07:47:53] CoderGuy: When you do, make sure you define it.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	CoderGuy	[07:48:06] yeah
2021-07-17 15:00:02	CoderGuy	[07:49:17] I have another question, camelCase is great, especially when determining you're dealing with a function, but this looks weird styleProperties();  StyleProperties(); looks more official, now the C# community would argue against camelCase, Thoughts?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[07:50:01] Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/d62f0e69a3b34c588cbea844bb8ac47d/image.png
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[07:50:24] the answer is 7 but how/
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[07:51:49] teut: Eww. fork() should always be immediately followed by an exec(). :)  But yes, I think the correct answer is 7.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[07:52:01] teut: What number do you think you should be getting?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[07:52:06] 3
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[07:52:24] a fork generates a child process
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[07:52:31] whats the logic?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[07:52:53] actually 4  , 3 children + one main process
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[07:53:13] created 3  !
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[07:53:32] teut, the child processes also runs the fork()
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[07:54:21] after the first fork, you have one new process, and one old, but both those two processes run the second fork
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[07:56:32] how do you know that the child has not returned?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[07:57:06] this question presumes context and understanding not shared
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[07:57:18] fork() returns in both processes, old and new
2021-07-17 15:00:02	CoderGuy	[07:57:24] okay I asked in c# and realized I should match the naming conventions for the language i'm coding in
2021-07-17 15:00:02	CoderGuy	[07:57:44] so camelCase for languages that have camelCase as the convention for functions, and PascalCase for things like c#
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[07:58:13] amigojapan: Konnichola.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[07:59:06] (it returns with different return value, but since the return value is not used in this sample program, that is irrelevant)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[07:59:17] CoderGuy: As always, try to find the conventional style guide for the language and framework you're using, and follow it.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[07:59:58] CoderGuy: in javascript i use camelCase for names of variables/instances and PascalCase for names of classes
2021-07-17 15:00:02	beaky	[08:02:32] i like snake_case and skewer-case is even better i try to use those 2 even in languages that use the other cases because its just superior
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:02:47] so how can anyone  spawn three processes synchronously then ?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	beaky	[08:02:50] and break conventions
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:03:05] beaky: is skewer-case even allowed in most languages?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	beaky	[08:03:32] no only a few like lisp
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:03:47] i.e, what's the command to check if process ended?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:03:50] oh interesting, need to look at list again
2021-07-17 15:00:02	amigojapan	[08:04:00] beaky: are you sure - is a valid character in every language?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	amigojapan	[08:04:16] Ah someone already asked
2021-07-17 15:00:02	beaky	[08:04:32] very few languages but in those cases i just use the unicode hyphen instead
2021-07-17 15:00:02	beaky	[08:04:42] because you gotta have unicode
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:05:31] even if thats a silly question , plz reply, it's only if you tell then I know
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[08:05:35] teut, it is unclear what you mean by "three processes", but the general usage of fork is something like pid=fork(); if(!pid){//do child process things, probably including exec as mentioned since there are many things you cannot rely on from the parent process in the child process}
2021-07-17 15:00:02	amigojapan	[08:05:57] beaky: if you can have Unicode characters you could just name your variables in Japanese
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[08:06:13] you can do that kind of thing many times in your program, no reason to stop a three, or before
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:06:51] W: I think teut is asking how to detect if child process finished after the fork. I'd be curious to learn that too tbh
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:07:01] yes
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:07:11] *detect in parent when child process finished
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[08:07:15] I see. The return value of fork() to the /parent/ process is the PID of the child
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[08:07:19] you can use that to interrogate it
2021-07-17 15:00:02	amigojapan	[08:07:33] beaky: the language "mind"is a complied language which has commands in Japanese
2021-07-17 15:00:02	beaky	[08:07:34] yes like the ツ happy face japanese character would make a great identifier
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:08:10] let me google it quick, maybe I can find a function that returns process status based on pid
2021-07-17 15:00:02	beaky	[08:08:22] put a smile to programmers having to work with my convention-breaking naming style
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:09:33] thanks W  things are clearer  now
2021-07-17 15:00:02	amigojapan	[08:09:38] beaky: all variables different kaomoji ,(´・ω・｀)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:10:35] teut: you can use IPC like use a pipe to communicate with your subprocess, that's one idea
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:11:07] ah yes, there is  some command function  to wait
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:11:21] or while loop
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:11:34] wait will be blocking though
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:11:55] waitpid to be specific
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:11:57] yes but that's what we want here don't we?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:12:27] oh if that's the case then this will work
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:13:05] in case of single core ,  is there some "process" switching like context switching in threads?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:13:35] concurrent instead of parallel I mean
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[08:15:33] yes, this is more generally called "multitasking"; the operating system is responsible for managing multiple processes sharing CPU resources
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:16:43] oh, ok, so this was multitasking
2021-07-17 15:00:02	W	[08:17:16] specifically, on modern operating systems, preemptive multitasking is what is used
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[08:18:16] I'm really not sure what that example would do on Cygwin, though.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:19:09] looks like some scheduling thing on googling
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:24:49] teut: I was wrong, wait() will work too!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:25:35] i m on windows , and here its a totally different world
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:26:08] its createProcess  command and there are no children if I remember correctly
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:26:34] ah, well I'd be using the LSW2 in that case :P
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:26:53] or cygwin, although I'm not sure how these options are tbh
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:27:09] me neither
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:28:34] teut: you can always use a vm, and work in linux or some unix
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:29:56] yes, I installed it once and then my pc crashed whenever I ran something like the browser and vscode together inside it.I was having I5 processor with 8 gb ram
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:33:37] teut: the linxu vm box can be much less resource demanding, you don't need to install all the graphical falirs like gnome
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:34:39] I had used vmware workstation player
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:35:00] teut: but you would need to have some level of familiarity with linux and bash to navigate it... Maybe lsw2/cygwin is the best option in your case. Onestly I was using cygwin 15 years ago and it was working I could even make simple opengl demos
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:35:01] oracle's one was was not working due to xyz reasons
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:35:12] I know that much linux
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:35:23] ls , cat , grep  ....
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:35:45] oh well that sounds not bad, then you should be able to navigate cli-only linux
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:35:54] teut: most important commands imo are man and info ;)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:36:03] and help
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:37:14] help, is the universally necessary command
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:38:18] is man for manpages or something?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Trashlord	[08:38:42] yes
2021-07-17 15:00:02	Trashlord	[08:38:56] and woman for womanpages
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:39:49] I tend to also apt install bash-doc, glibc-doc, gcc-doc, gdb-doc, make-doc for the info documents which are more like books in terminal
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:40:25] lol
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:40:40] well without the commas
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:40:42] man manual pages
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:41:10] i recently only saw this word in some docs
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:41:29] teut: you should really get familiar with man
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:41:43] teut: start with man man
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:42:52] ya , I ll see
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:43:27] teut: then you will be able to man fork or man wait, that what I did to try and help you
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:46:34] HELP is the equivalent Windows command for man.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:04:49] main
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-17 15:00:02	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	 *	pyzozord [09:06:13] types "man mrig"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:06:19] Who said it was being coverned by a dictator?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:06:58] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept. <- whos dictum?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-17 15:00:02	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-17 15:00:02	***	Playback Complete.
2021-07-17 15:00:05	arahael	vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.

2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:13:01] oldlaptop: thanks for your (implied?) offer, but my schema is still in flux atm, and a little reassurance was all I was looking for :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	|smlckz|	[00:13:02] okay, groff is ignoring the redefinition of some macros, works fine in heirloom troff and mandoc.. what can i do?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	guest4389	[00:13:57] arahael: potentially? it's not by default? im saving all my libraries in C:\Users\name\lib\
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:14:02] ross: We often give advice to help the *community* here engage and answer the questions.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:15:23] oldlaptop: What's your timezone, out of curiosity? You seem to be on when I'm on.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:15:29] arahael: could you clarify what you mean by that in this specific scenario? do you suggest I re-ask my question with details anyway for the sake of improving and/or engaging in community discussion even if I don't have a specific problem?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:15:31] I mean, I'm not a database admin either, I just write everything in sqlite.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:15:37] sqlite ftw
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:15:44] sqlite is awesome.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:15:50] arahael: GMT-4 at the moment, because the politicians think that's better than GMT-5 in the summer
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:15:54] sqlite is awesome.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:16:00] oldlaptop: Oh, wow.  I'm GMT+10.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	[R]	[00:16:07] sqlite is amazing if you don't care about the fact that you can throw 8GB of text into an INT column
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:16:14] I'm using it for the new iteration of my work's logistics system.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:16:15] using sqlite in client-side JS atm and it's not even close to being the biggest js bundle I've pushed to users
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:16:16] amazing
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:16:21] To replace a giant CSV file.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	|smlckz|	[00:16:35] sorry, not some, but all redefinitions.. groff man's manpage says, it may ignore redefinitions of macros, what to do now?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:16:44] [R]: (you can't throw 8GB of text into any column, IIRC)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:16:55] *I didn't choose how the data was stored last year, I just had to turn it into optimised routes.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	[R]	[00:17:27] oldlaptop: sqlite doesn't do type checking
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:17:33] I noticed.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:17:44] You don't always _need_ type checking.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:18:35] ross: It really depends on what you want, oldlaptop was just suggesting how you might get more advice on the higher level design. But if you only wanted to know that low-level specific detail, then that's fine.  You seem to be competent here, so I'm not worried - but others are known to be very susceptable to X-Y questions: Ask and worry about X, when their real question and concern is Y.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:19:06] ross: It's mostly to catch X-Y questions that people ask for more context.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:19:10] oh I'm sure I'm not yet good enough to guarantee that I'm not inadvertently XYing
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:19:44] I'm not sure anyone really is
2021-07-17 15:00:42	guest4389	[00:20:36] i found it. it's not recursive.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Izem	[00:20:52] immibis: thanks for the advice
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:21:56] guest4389: There's a few different definitions for "recursive".
2021-07-17 15:00:42	[R]	[00:22:41] Thedarkb-Desktop: Having a language that strongly type checks and an implimentation that doesn't at all, is not a feature
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Thedarkb-Desktop	[00:23:04] It's not a feature, but it's something you can live with.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:23:04] hi all! apropos of nothing, I have a question about sql db design. part of my app involves the user creating Conditions, which are a series of condition terms, where an individual condition term is either a function or an operator. operators are things like AND, OR, NOT. I'm storing condition terms in their own table, and as a result, the parent 'conditions' table doesn't actually contain anything other than a primary key. is this a good practice?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:23:05] https://bpa.st/7EGA
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:23:24] guest4389: Consider you might have a subdirectory that actually places you in a parent directory, and as you keep recursing, you'll do that forever.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	guest4389	[00:23:24]  "You need to specify each directory individually, the PATH mechanism doesn't walk through subdirectories."
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:24:03] guest4389: Depending on the API, you might be wanting to look at "globbing" mechanisms.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	beaky	[00:26:14] ross: yes having the 'keys' of the terms on a separate table from the terms themselves is more normalized
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:27:50] ross: maybe I'm missing something, but I'm not sure having the separate conditions table accomplishes anything useful besides making it possible to represent an empty condition
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:28:23] oldlaptop: a condition should be able to be empty, yes - but a condition can contain any number of terms and operators
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:28:42] e.g. the condition `hasItem(pen) AND NOT hasItem(egg)` contains 4 terms
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:28:56] 'any number' includes 0
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:29:12] hence the 1-to-many relationship between conditions and condition terms
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:29:17] the foreign key constraint from conditionTerms requires you to "create" the condition first, but if you don't need empty ones (or you find some excuse to not need empty ones) then you could simply say that a condition exists simply by having a conditionTerm with its ID
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:29:46] I could, but I do need to be sure that an empty condition can exist - when the user creates a new condition, it will necessarily be empty
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:30:48] is it necessary to create the condition, in this sense, at all if the user hasn't added any terms to it? (I suspect the answer is probably yes...)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:31:28] ross: Is the user creating these tables dynamically, effectively? That's also "ok" in sqlite, but I'd probably suggest a more static design if you can fit it well.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:31:39] possibly not? I think it's easier to guarantee that a row in the condition table exists even if the condition is empty rather than attempt to avoid hitting the database if the UI field is empty, perhaps at the cost of a little db space
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:32:09] arahael: no, these tables are fixed - this is the (partial) schema for the save file for a dialogue tree editor
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:32:21] they are creating rows dynamically :P
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:32:43] ross: Ah, good.  Also, regarding "hitting the database", I'd be a bit less concerned about that when it comes to sqlite.  sqlite is that awesome.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:33:03] oh agreed, I'm not worried about performance, just coding complexity lmao
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:33:09] I agree this question is probably not of much practical interest, the conditions table is going to waste, what, eight octets per condition, with a minimum of (if this is sqlite) one page?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:33:11] Cool. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:33:18] arahael: much easier to do things if you can guarantee that something exists, even if it's empty
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:33:52] oldlaptop: perhaps it might be of concern if I am running this on a nokia brick
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:34:04] ross: Some database guys would probably find that problematic "your app's details are leaking into the database", but meh, I think that's perfectly valid when it comes to sqlite. It's an app-side database.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:34:34] the *real* low-hanging fruit for space-waste is the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY in conditionFunctions :P
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:34:42] arahael: that's a good point. I have to admit I'm not well versed in good practices when it comes to 'proper' databases
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:35:21] (even though it's sqlite you could make name the primary key in a WITHOUT ROWID database and save a whole eight octets per row)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:35:30] oldlaptop: it's referred to by the `conditionFunctionArgumentTypes` table, no?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:36:48] Sure, but that could refer to the name instead, in principle. Depending on how long names usually are, that probably cuts into the savings a fair bit
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:37:53] oldlaptop: it could, but I don't like that - were I to update the name of a conditionFunction, I'd then have to iterate over the conditionFunctionArgumentTypes table and ensure that all those names are updated to. I chose to use a db in the first place to avoid having to do this
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:37:53] (I'm still being mostly silly here, I strongly doubt it's worth worrying about)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:38:06] *are updated too
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:38:20] the DB should be able to do that for you
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:38:39] really? interesting
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:39:15] https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:39:21] of course making it do that in the first place is *another* cost
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:40:07] true, true - my instinct is that that would be useful if I wasn't already using integer primary keys?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:40:13] will definitely look into it though!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:40:35] Or if for some reason you wanted to update the integer primary keys, I suppose.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:40:44] funnily enough, I thought the most noteworthy issues with this scheme would be sortIndex and the CHECK constraint in conditionTerms
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:40:50] oldlaptop: oh, I doubt I'd do that
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:40:58] (The usual sort of integer primary key you get in the ISO Standard Database is not the kind of thing that gets updated)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:41:39] agreed, primary keys should be a technical implementation detail imo and not for either the user or the developer to worry about - very much the concern of the db driver and it alone
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:41:50] I don't really like the sortIndex either (that defines the order in which the terms are arranged?), but I can't think of something better offhand either.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:42:19] yes, I did some googling about it and couldn't find a conclusive answer. baffling that it's not, like... an absurdly common problem
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:42:20] I wouldn't write an OR with numeric addition, but it works in sqlite.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:43:11] ah, it's not an OR really - I guess it is an OR in the case with 2 columns
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:43:20] but say 5 columns, and I must guarantee that only 1 is not NULL
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:43:50] here's another part of my schema with 3 such columns https://bpa.st/7IMA
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:43:55] meaning there are other tables not shown here where the sum has more... ah.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:44:40] this is my entire schema so far in all its unfinished glory https://bpa.st/IWJA
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:45:08] going way back to your original question, you could do this with conditionTerms.operator, if you wanted!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:45:08] <arahael> ross: Ie, other tables can have a relation defined that they must map to an item in that table, such that there are a restricted set of options.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:45:15] (the 'conditionals' table at the bottom will be scrapped pending a re-think)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:45:49] yeah, it ultimately depends on just how you need to specify and update that set of options.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:45:51] oldlaptop: this is new vocabulary to me
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:45:59] <table>.operator?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:46:06] oh you mean the column
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:46:08] haha silly me
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:46:13] Yes
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:46:43] yes, I could definitely use an enum for that, and did consider it
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:47:33] You could have something like `CREATE TABLE operators(operator TEXT PRIMARY KEY); INSERT INTO operators VALUES ('and'), ('or'), ('not'), /* whatever */;
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:47:42] but I decided not to on the basis that if my user loads a corrupt schema, or a schema from a future version of the app, with an unknown operator, it would be better for the error message to contain "Unknown operator: XAND" or w/e rather than "Unknown operator" or worse "Unknown operator with ID 4"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:48:09] sorry, db, not schema
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:48:10] which would have the same advantage over the obvious CHECK constraint that it has over the postgres enum types arahael mentioned
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:49:07] Keep in mind the schema goes with the DB
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:49:12] (I guess that error message doesn't really matter as there's no way for the user to actually fix it... that information doesn't help them)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:49:56] if I save a file from rossApp 2.0, which has the new BLORGINATE operator, and open it in rossApp 1.0, the constraints will all still be fine, rossApp 1.0 just isn't going to know what the heck BLORGINATE is
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:50:47] unless you do something really wild, like store the implementation of the operator in the database (goes best with dynamic langauges for obvious reasons)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:51:08] "store the implementation of the operator in the database" - oh boy that sounds like !fun!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:51:57] hmmm. I will consider the enum approach
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:52:00] code gets stored in "real" databases all the time, and a lot of users of "real" databases seem to want sqlite to get its own PL/SQL interpreter or something to do that itself
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:52:12] I admit I don't see any advantage or disadvantage one way or the other (re enums)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:52:27] oldlaptop: that is interesting, will be worth reading about
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:52:38] the search term would be "stored procedures"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:53:09] oldlaptop: yeah, frankly i think sqlite should continue to avoid pl/sql.  people can always settle on whatever scripting language they like and register extensions.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:53:34] for most purposes, sqlite's support for application-defined functions does what you might want them for, and for some other purposes you could dump your code in the database and execute it yourself
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:54:02] arguably better, too, given the circumstances sqlite is used in.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:54:49] I suppose that could be useful in some cases - a db that stores procedures and not data is just another kind of data. can't think of any such cases off the top of my head thoug
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:55:38] I guess you could use a static set of stored procedures to ensure that applications only interact with the db in a certain way, beyond what column constraints can guarantee?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:55:41] in a client/server database it can be very important to have code that executes on the server rather than the client
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:55:59] indeed, but sqlite is not a client/server database.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ross	[00:56:02] ah! true - and you might not have enough need to implement a server-side implementation
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:56:25] there is no such distinction for an embedded database like sqlite, though, so there's no reason (say) a new sql function can't just be application code
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[00:57:12] the remaining irritation is that you can run into trouble if, say, you create a schema that uses some custom function or collation sequence, then try to open it with the sqlite3 command shell or something
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:58:42] i'm not sure i like the idea of having a data format being able to execute arbitruary code, though, so i prefer sqlite as it is.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[00:59:32] eg, if i get a random sqlite file from someone and load it in sqlite3, i wouldnt want it to execute random stuff and install crap.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:00:10] such a pl/sql would need to be sandboxed *very* well.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	 *	oldlaptop [01:01:47] *can* think of a way to (try to) do that, offhand: http://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/safe.htm
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:02:14] IIRC pgTcl or whatever postgres calls its tcl-stored-procedure feature uses safe interps
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:02:59] (of course tcl is a pretty big thing to drag around with sqlite everywhere, and the various stripped-down tcls don't have safetcl)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:03:30] potentially reasonable, but wouldnt be JIT code either, and wouldnt be something you can assume anywhere
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:03:34] *everywhere.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:04:05] iOS would be a bit problematic there too.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:04:21] (depends on how you use it)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:04:41] (one day! https://core.tcl-lang.org/tclquadcode/dir?ci=tip)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:04:52] (llvm is an even bigger thing to drag around with sqlite everywhere)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:05:14] oldlaptop: right, but still wouldnt be on iOS!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:05:37] we don't even have JIT for JS unless you execute within safari's webview.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:06:14] for "hardware" reasons. (ignoring that safari can do it just fine, so clearly the hardware can do it).
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:07:04] Hi, people, etc.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:07:45] arahael: if you want to keep the absurd alternate universe where any of this actually goes into sqlite going, no reason sqlite-plus-tcl-plus-llvm couldn't get the same exemption safari gets
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:07:56] it's a core OS component after all
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:08:49] back in reality, it's a core OS component that ain't never getting "stored procedure" support
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:09:39] oldlaptop: there is that, yes, though you can run javascript core in your own process, you just don't get JIT, so i suspect that similar would happen, then again, pigs can fly, and apple could easily change their mind.  hell, we're getting xcode on ipads soon, maybe.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:10:48] What did I miss?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:11:00] no JIT on appleware???
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:11:02] wow
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:11:40] [context: sqlite does not have stored procedure support, and stored procedure support isn't really desirable; if it were desirable and could exist, it couldn't be implemented with a JIT on iOS)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:11:46] do firefox and chrome have to beg them?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:11:56] {I can't remember which grouping symbols I'm using>
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:12:00] ehnet3d: all web browsers use safari's engine on ios.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:12:06] loooooooool
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:12:48] i really didn't need another reason to never use ios/macos but thanks for another one
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:13:05] macOS is (still, for now) very different in this regard
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:13:13] same company
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:13:19] same radical ideology
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:13:30] you actually can just compile things on it and run them (still, for now)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:14:12] and you can (still, for now, sort of, if you tell users how to bypass the signature checking stuff) even distribute the binaries for people to run
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:14:51] (and even if you can't tell them to bypass signature checking, you can still, for now, sort of, get your own random binary signed and distribute it outside the App Store thingummy.)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:15:37] indeed.  important to realise that apple mainly just does things differently, and in some cases much better. in others, more annoying/frustrating.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:16:01] what do they do that's much better
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:16:12] personally having differences is good. keeps a competition going.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[01:16:26] better restrictions on their users
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:17:14] I'm sure macOS and the other darwin derivatives have their strong points as development platforms. Some people probably liked objc, and some people probably like swift
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:17:35] kind of.  they have been really good on real world privacy lately, eg, forcing facebook to an opt-in model for tracking.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:17:51] They're alleged by fans to be very good at UI design - not so sure about that myself :|
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:18:20] there have been dumb things in apple UIs since the infamous throw-the-floppy-in-the-trash-to-eject-it metaphor
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:18:32] oldlaptop: they are/were very good at that, but lately they've been trying to "hide" clutter, which is annoying and makes discovery harder. :(
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:18:56] ah, heh, yeah. throw the floppy into the trash was bizarre.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:19:38] some of the application UIs in the late '90s made the same sorts of mistakes that were an industry-wide plague around that time (quicktime was a poster child)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:19:49] My father found it unsettling that he had to throw his favorite music in the trash to eject the CD.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:20:25] oldlaptop: fairly consistent within the apple walled garden, at least, though.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:20:49] they were *inconsistent* with everything else on macs at the time, that was part of the industry-wide plague
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:21:01] I think I might need a Catalina VM to see if my OS upgrade broke some of my code.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:21:29] oldlaptop: ah, fair.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:21:46] And if it did, I might need to abandon my project.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	oldlaptop	[01:21:53] subjectively, I don't think iOS/iPadOS as it is now is particularly approachable/intuitive for non-appleites beyond a surface level (but my sample size is not large, though non-one)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:21:53] anyway, just pointing out that it's not bad for apple to push for a different model.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:22:31] vdamewood: sadly, apple does often do that :(
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:22:59] arahael: In apple's defence, I might have been (ab)using a non-public API.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pikapika	[01:23:01] arahael, what do you think of David Hilbert?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:23:04] vdamewood: it's one reason i keep dependencies and code to a minimum - there is a lot of churn :(
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:23:16] pikapika: do i know him?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:23:24] Or rather, a non-public extension of an API.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pikapika	[01:23:25] arahael, do you?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:23:43] pikapika: no?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:23:46] On the other hand, everything works perfectly for PIv6, so maybe I messed something up.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:26:43] IPv6, I mean.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:30:04] probably. but apple.  they did change some of the networking stuff in big sur.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:33:36] Well, to th VM then.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:34:07] And now my dock is showing up over my full screen apps.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[01:36:21] thats why i auto-hide them.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:37:26] Normall, the doc is hidden with full-screen apps.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:37:31] dock*
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:37:38] and normally*
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[01:38:27] Well, this is annoying. I'll be back.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	guest4389	[02:12:20] makefile, cmake or something else? Which do you use and why?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[02:14:22] makefile, easiest to use
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[02:21:24] guest4389: I use pbxproj files.  They're awful.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	guest4389	[02:24:41] pbxproj? Is that for xcode?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[02:25:21] Yep.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	meleoron	[04:21:44] what is a good place to find C reference and standard online?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[04:26:11] soo
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[04:26:18] what are you guys working on right now?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	yitz	[04:27:38] Cookies
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[04:27:47] Oh god I hate cookies
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[04:28:05] but fuck it, I love money, fuck privacy pro google everyone!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	yitz	[04:28:11] Good. I wasn't planning on sharing.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[04:32:54] Why is there 531 people online and so quiet
2021-07-17 15:00:42	alekhine	[04:33:41] Well mark, IRC is usually like that. By the way, your website is horrible and you should be ashamed of what you've done
2021-07-17 15:00:42	yitz	[04:33:52] No one asked an interesting programming-related question for them to chime in on
2021-07-17 15:00:42	meleoron	[04:34:35] what is a good place to find C reference and standard online?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:35:01] I think the finalized C standards still must be paid for
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:35:18] and they are like hidden behind lots of govt beaurocracy
2021-07-17 15:00:42	alekhine	[04:35:28] Damn, in the year 2021?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:35:30] But I think final drafts are available online
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:35:33] for free
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:35:43] Final drafts, not necessarily exactly what went into the published thing
2021-07-17 15:00:42	meleoron	[04:35:45] is the website `https://en.cppreference.com` good as a reference?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:36:40] alekhine, you'd be surprised
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:36:49] I think WLAN standards are paywalled too
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:36:56] and probably have ndas too
2021-07-17 15:00:42	PlanckWalk	[04:38:26] Yeah.  "If you're writing software in this language, pay the tax to us."
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:38:44] Both ISO and IEEE are paywalled
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:38:52] ISO is for C, IEEE is for wlan
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[04:39:12] maybe you could find the ANSI C89 document somewhere
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:39:35] ANSI is also paid I think, we only get to see the final draft but not the actual publication
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:39:40] which is copyrighted and paid for
2021-07-17 15:00:42	alekhine	[04:39:46] This is why Zig is better than C
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:39:53] and also have to move through some govt labyrinths to actually find how to purchase
2021-07-17 15:00:42	PlanckWalk	[04:40:12] You could read your compiler source code to at least find out how *it* interprets the source code, but it's written in a language that has a paywalled spec too...
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:40:43] I think gcc now uses some C++
2021-07-17 15:00:42	meleoron	[04:41:22] alekhine: i plan to learn Zig, Nim, Rust and friends after i've got an in depth knowledge of C.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	meleoron	[04:41:25] is the website `https://en.cppreference.com` good as a reference?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	PlanckWalk	[04:41:35] Even then you still wouldn't know for sure whether some weird behaviour of the compiler is expected behaviour according to the spec, or a compiler bug.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	meleoron	[04:42:08] PlanckWalk: with popular compilers, one can be reasonably sure that bugs won't be easy to find.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:42:15] Most of the documents you find online are the final drafts
2021-07-17 15:00:42	PlanckWalk	[04:42:20] It's probably safest to assume that 99% of all software written in these languages is full of bugs anyway, but at least it wouldbe nice to be able to *prove* it.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:42:27] Which may not be exactly identical to the finally published and paywalled document
2021-07-17 15:00:42	david_hilbert	[04:42:36] but we can reasonably expect it would match almost wholly
2021-07-17 15:00:42	PlanckWalk	[04:43:01] Yep.  if you need to *know* then you have to pay.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	meleoron	[04:44:20] i suppose ISO holds copyright on the text of the standard.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:03:20] if you have unlimited time and money
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:03:29] what would you work on?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	PlanckWalk	[05:04:40] Finding out how to get unlimited time and money to everyone else.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ChromaCat248	[05:05:46] just made my first commit to my window manager project in over a month
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:06:55] Most people spend most of their life finding out how to get unlimited time and money
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:06:58] and sometimes it comes
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:07:06] markzuckerberg: I'd probably work on my family tree project. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:07:08] and none of us really thought about how to keep it
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:07:35] arahael that's amazing, I've seen someone do it, it dated way way back
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:07:55] markzuckerberg: The hard part is avoiding bias, though.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:08:04] markzuckerberg: You have very limited evidence and it can be interpreted many ways.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:08:19] ChromaCat248 just have to keep committing consistently
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:08:31] just like we show up to work everyday
2021-07-17 15:00:42	 *	arahael [05:08:56] doesn't show up at work every day!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:08:59] arahael cursed problem? how do we avoid it, or is it impossible
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:09:13] arahael you have to, it compounds
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:09:20] just show up, no matter how late
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:09:20] markzuckerberg: I work from home.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	markzuckerberg	[05:09:24] oh
2021-07-17 15:00:42	edgar-rft	[05:11:31] arahael: if you're working from home then show up at work as soon as you wake up :-)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:11:58] Ha.  Actually no, I make a point of *not* doing any work until I properly start.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:12:17] One trap of working from home is always being "switched on" for work.  Have to really avoid that otherwise you go insane.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:12:39] Oh, fun. Just discovered a new plant allergy. :(
2021-07-17 15:00:42	edgar-rft	[05:13:08] every day someting new :-)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:13:24] My skin is seriously blistering up!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:13:51] It's pretty amazing.  Super-itchy, though. :(  The plant is pumpkin.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	edgar-rft	[05:14:21] you're allergic against helloween?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	blahboybaz	[05:21:27] Are there any caveats to defining a function like: let f = () => return something;  (using an arrow function) rather then like: let f = function(){return something;}  or  function f(){return something;}  What I mean is can there be a difference show up when you use it later that affect the caller in some way you need to know about?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	blahboybaz	[05:21:39] for javascript

2021-07-17 15:00:42	Guest9	[05:22:15] what is meaning of last line?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:22:30] edgar-rft: No, pumpkins themselves are delicious.  I think it's just the prickles on the plant itself.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	ehnet3d	[05:22:44] looks like a revenue search
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Guest9	[05:23:01] from anvil.tables import app_tables
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[05:23:42] edgar-rft: I was weeding my wife's garden and threw out a few old pumpkin plants.  Anywhere the skin is thin has broken out in a big rash.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[05:27:42] Slurp!

2021-07-17 15:00:42	Guest9	[06:06:49] why kid_graph replaces topic_graph? isnt it possible to display both?

2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[07:01:46] blahboybaz: not that I know of, the this inside the arrow functions (aka closures) behaves different, but that's the whole point. Generally they are used very interchangably, many devs just prefer arrowfunctions and use exlusively only them
2021-07-17 15:00:42	amigojapan	[07:15:45] Konnichola vdamewood
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Trashlord	[07:18:04] konnichola?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	amigojapan	[07:18:36] Trashlord: mixture of konnichiwa and hola
2021-07-17 15:00:42	CoderGuy	[07:43:39] are the properties of a gui class that have to do with style/display the style properties?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[07:46:31] Speaking of arrows, I'm trying to learn them in haskell.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[07:46:41] CoderGuy: They can be.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	CoderGuy	[07:46:59] hmm okay cool
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[07:47:05] CoderGuy: You'll want to check the docs for the GUI framework you're using for their terminology and definitions.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	CoderGuy	[07:47:17] oh i'm creating my own
2021-07-17 15:00:42	CoderGuy	[07:47:20] I just wanted to know what to name it
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[07:47:53] CoderGuy: When you do, make sure you define it.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	CoderGuy	[07:48:06] yeah
2021-07-17 15:00:42	CoderGuy	[07:49:17] I have another question, camelCase is great, especially when determining you're dealing with a function, but this looks weird styleProperties();  StyleProperties(); looks more official, now the C# community would argue against camelCase, Thoughts?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[07:50:01] Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/d62f0e69a3b34c588cbea844bb8ac47d/image.png
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[07:50:24] the answer is 7 but how/
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[07:51:49] teut: Eww. fork() should always be immediately followed by an exec(). :)  But yes, I think the correct answer is 7.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[07:52:01] teut: What number do you think you should be getting?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[07:52:06] 3
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[07:52:24] a fork generates a child process
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[07:52:31] whats the logic?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[07:52:53] actually 4  , 3 children + one main process
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[07:53:13] created 3  !
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[07:53:32] teut, the child processes also runs the fork()
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[07:54:21] after the first fork, you have one new process, and one old, but both those two processes run the second fork
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[07:56:32] how do you know that the child has not returned?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[07:57:06] this question presumes context and understanding not shared
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[07:57:18] fork() returns in both processes, old and new
2021-07-17 15:00:42	CoderGuy	[07:57:24] okay I asked in c# and realized I should match the naming conventions for the language i'm coding in
2021-07-17 15:00:42	CoderGuy	[07:57:44] so camelCase for languages that have camelCase as the convention for functions, and PascalCase for things like c#
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[07:58:13] amigojapan: Konnichola.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[07:59:06] (it returns with different return value, but since the return value is not used in this sample program, that is irrelevant)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[07:59:17] CoderGuy: As always, try to find the conventional style guide for the language and framework you're using, and follow it.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[07:59:58] CoderGuy: in javascript i use camelCase for names of variables/instances and PascalCase for names of classes
2021-07-17 15:00:42	beaky	[08:02:32] i like snake_case and skewer-case is even better i try to use those 2 even in languages that use the other cases because its just superior
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:02:47] so how can anyone  spawn three processes synchronously then ?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	beaky	[08:02:50] and break conventions
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:03:05] beaky: is skewer-case even allowed in most languages?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	beaky	[08:03:32] no only a few like lisp
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:03:47] i.e, what's the command to check if process ended?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:03:50] oh interesting, need to look at list again
2021-07-17 15:00:42	amigojapan	[08:04:00] beaky: are you sure - is a valid character in every language?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	amigojapan	[08:04:16] Ah someone already asked
2021-07-17 15:00:42	beaky	[08:04:32] very few languages but in those cases i just use the unicode hyphen instead
2021-07-17 15:00:42	beaky	[08:04:42] because you gotta have unicode
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:05:31] even if thats a silly question , plz reply, it's only if you tell then I know
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[08:05:35] teut, it is unclear what you mean by "three processes", but the general usage of fork is something like pid=fork(); if(!pid){//do child process things, probably including exec as mentioned since there are many things you cannot rely on from the parent process in the child process}
2021-07-17 15:00:42	amigojapan	[08:05:57] beaky: if you can have Unicode characters you could just name your variables in Japanese
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[08:06:13] you can do that kind of thing many times in your program, no reason to stop a three, or before
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:06:51] W: I think teut is asking how to detect if child process finished after the fork. I'd be curious to learn that too tbh
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:07:01] yes
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:07:11] *detect in parent when child process finished
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[08:07:15] I see. The return value of fork() to the /parent/ process is the PID of the child
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[08:07:19] you can use that to interrogate it
2021-07-17 15:00:42	amigojapan	[08:07:33] beaky: the language "mind"is a complied language which has commands in Japanese
2021-07-17 15:00:42	beaky	[08:07:34] yes like the ツ happy face japanese character would make a great identifier
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:08:10] let me google it quick, maybe I can find a function that returns process status based on pid
2021-07-17 15:00:42	beaky	[08:08:22] put a smile to programmers having to work with my convention-breaking naming style
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:09:33] thanks W  things are clearer  now
2021-07-17 15:00:42	amigojapan	[08:09:38] beaky: all variables different kaomoji ,(´・ω・｀)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:10:35] teut: you can use IPC like use a pipe to communicate with your subprocess, that's one idea
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:11:07] ah yes, there is  some command function  to wait
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:11:21] or while loop
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:11:34] wait will be blocking though
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:11:55] waitpid to be specific
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:11:57] yes but that's what we want here don't we?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:12:27] oh if that's the case then this will work
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:13:05] in case of single core ,  is there some "process" switching like context switching in threads?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:13:35] concurrent instead of parallel I mean
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[08:15:33] yes, this is more generally called "multitasking"; the operating system is responsible for managing multiple processes sharing CPU resources
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:16:43] oh, ok, so this was multitasking
2021-07-17 15:00:42	W	[08:17:16] specifically, on modern operating systems, preemptive multitasking is what is used
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[08:18:16] I'm really not sure what that example would do on Cygwin, though.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:19:09] looks like some scheduling thing on googling
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:24:49] teut: I was wrong, wait() will work too!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:25:35] i m on windows , and here its a totally different world
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:26:08] its createProcess  command and there are no children if I remember correctly
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:26:34] ah, well I'd be using the LSW2 in that case :P
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:26:53] or cygwin, although I'm not sure how these options are tbh
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:27:09] me neither
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:28:34] teut: you can always use a vm, and work in linux or some unix
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:29:56] yes, I installed it once and then my pc crashed whenever I ran something like the browser and vscode together inside it.I was having I5 processor with 8 gb ram
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:33:37] teut: the linxu vm box can be much less resource demanding, you don't need to install all the graphical falirs like gnome
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:34:39] I had used vmware workstation player
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:35:00] teut: but you would need to have some level of familiarity with linux and bash to navigate it... Maybe lsw2/cygwin is the best option in your case. Onestly I was using cygwin 15 years ago and it was working I could even make simple opengl demos
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:35:01] oracle's one was was not working due to xyz reasons
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:35:12] I know that much linux
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:35:23] ls , cat , grep  ....
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:35:45] oh well that sounds not bad, then you should be able to navigate cli-only linux
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:35:54] teut: most important commands imo are man and info ;)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:36:03] and help
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:37:14] help, is the universally necessary command
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:38:18] is man for manpages or something?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Trashlord	[08:38:42] yes
2021-07-17 15:00:42	Trashlord	[08:38:56] and woman for womanpages
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:39:49] I tend to also apt install bash-doc, glibc-doc, gcc-doc, gdb-doc, make-doc for the info documents which are more like books in terminal
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:40:25] lol
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:40:40] well without the commas
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:40:42] man manual pages
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:41:10] i recently only saw this word in some docs
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:41:29] teut: you should really get familiar with man
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:41:43] teut: start with man man
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:42:52] ya , I ll see
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:43:27] teut: then you will be able to man fork or man wait, that what I did to try and help you
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:46:34] HELP is the equivalent Windows command for man.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:04:49] main
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-17 15:00:42	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	 *	pyzozord [09:06:13] types "man mrig"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:06:19] Who said it was being coverned by a dictator?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:06:58] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept. <- whos dictum?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-17 15:00:42	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-17 15:00:42	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-17 15:00:42	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?

2021-07-17 15:00:53	vdamewood	So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-17 15:01:04	vdamewood	Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-17 15:01:16	mrig	immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-17 15:01:24	immibis	?
2021-07-17 15:01:49	vdamewood	And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-17 15:02:32	arahael	vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?

2021-07-17 15:02:52	pyzozord	In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p

2021-07-17 15:39:00	vdamewood	Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.

2021-07-17 15:41:21	GeDaMo	Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-17 15:41:28	arahael	pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-17 15:41:39	arahael	pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.

2021-07-17 19:43:52	beaky	[08:04:42] because you gotta have unicode
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:05:31] even if thats a silly question , plz reply, it's only if you tell then I know
2021-07-17 19:43:52	W	[08:05:35] teut, it is unclear what you mean by "three processes", but the general usage of fork is something like pid=fork(); if(!pid){//do child process things, probably including exec as mentioned since there are many things you cannot rely on from the parent process in the child process}
2021-07-17 19:43:52	amigojapan	[08:05:57] beaky: if you can have Unicode characters you could just name your variables in Japanese
2021-07-17 19:43:52	W	[08:06:13] you can do that kind of thing many times in your program, no reason to stop a three, or before
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:06:51] W: I think teut is asking how to detect if child process finished after the fork. I'd be curious to learn that too tbh
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:07:01] yes
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:07:11] *detect in parent when child process finished
2021-07-17 19:43:52	W	[08:07:15] I see. The return value of fork() to the /parent/ process is the PID of the child
2021-07-17 19:43:52	W	[08:07:19] you can use that to interrogate it
2021-07-17 19:43:52	amigojapan	[08:07:33] beaky: the language "mind"is a complied language which has commands in Japanese
2021-07-17 19:43:52	beaky	[08:07:34] yes like the ツ happy face japanese character would make a great identifier
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:08:10] let me google it quick, maybe I can find a function that returns process status based on pid
2021-07-17 19:43:52	beaky	[08:08:22] put a smile to programmers having to work with my convention-breaking naming style
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:09:33] thanks W  things are clearer  now
2021-07-17 19:43:52	amigojapan	[08:09:38] beaky: all variables different kaomoji ,(´・ω・｀)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:10:35] teut: you can use IPC like use a pipe to communicate with your subprocess, that's one idea
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:11:07] ah yes, there is  some command function  to wait
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:11:21] or while loop
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:11:34] wait will be blocking though
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:11:55] waitpid to be specific
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:11:57] yes but that's what we want here don't we?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:12:27] oh if that's the case then this will work
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:13:05] in case of single core ,  is there some "process" switching like context switching in threads?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:13:35] concurrent instead of parallel I mean
2021-07-17 19:43:52	W	[08:15:33] yes, this is more generally called "multitasking"; the operating system is responsible for managing multiple processes sharing CPU resources
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:16:43] oh, ok, so this was multitasking
2021-07-17 19:43:52	W	[08:17:16] specifically, on modern operating systems, preemptive multitasking is what is used
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[08:18:16] I'm really not sure what that example would do on Cygwin, though.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:19:09] looks like some scheduling thing on googling
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:24:49] teut: I was wrong, wait() will work too!
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:25:35] i m on windows , and here its a totally different world
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:26:08] its createProcess  command and there are no children if I remember correctly
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:26:34] ah, well I'd be using the LSW2 in that case :P
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:26:53] or cygwin, although I'm not sure how these options are tbh
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:27:09] me neither
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:28:34] teut: you can always use a vm, and work in linux or some unix
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:29:56] yes, I installed it once and then my pc crashed whenever I ran something like the browser and vscode together inside it.I was having I5 processor with 8 gb ram
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:33:37] teut: the linxu vm box can be much less resource demanding, you don't need to install all the graphical falirs like gnome
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:34:39] I had used vmware workstation player
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:35:00] teut: but you would need to have some level of familiarity with linux and bash to navigate it... Maybe lsw2/cygwin is the best option in your case. Onestly I was using cygwin 15 years ago and it was working I could even make simple opengl demos
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:35:01] oracle's one was was not working due to xyz reasons
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:35:12] I know that much linux
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:35:23] ls , cat , grep  ....
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:35:45] oh well that sounds not bad, then you should be able to navigate cli-only linux
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:35:54] teut: most important commands imo are man and info ;)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:36:03] and help
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:37:14] help, is the universally necessary command
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:38:18] is man for manpages or something?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Trashlord	[08:38:42] yes
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Trashlord	[08:38:56] and woman for womanpages
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:39:49] I tend to also apt install bash-doc, glibc-doc, gcc-doc, gdb-doc, make-doc for the info documents which are more like books in terminal
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:40:25] lol
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:40:40] well without the commas
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:40:42] man manual pages
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:41:10] i recently only saw this word in some docs
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:41:29] teut: you should really get familiar with man
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:41:43] teut: start with man man
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:42:52] ya , I ll see
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:43:27] teut: then you will be able to man fork or man wait, that what I did to try and help you
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:46:34] HELP is the equivalent Windows command for man.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:04:49] main
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-17 19:43:52	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	 *	pyzozord [09:06:13] types "man mrig"
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:06:19] Who said it was being coverned by a dictator?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:06:58] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept. <- whos dictum?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[09:30:44] Percussionist who is also deaf
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:30:53] So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:31:04] Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:31:15] immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:31:24] ?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:31:50] And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:32:32] vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:32:46] arahael: She has been deaf since birth and was initially rejected by the academy of music on this premise, She then proceeded to point out to the board members what was wrong with their musical notation system and how it failed to annotate the majority of the nuances that she could perceive.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:32:52] In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:32:57] arahael: I don't follow your logic?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:33:08] a xylophonist yes, highly skilled deaf musician.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:33:19] pyzozord: To be honest, i thought the original comment was just meant to be a pun.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:33:24] vdamewood: Ah, I thought it might sound almost the same.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:33:26] she made the academy panel look dumb, and rather deaf.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:33:43] Also, for what it's worth the word manual comes from the latun word for 'hand'.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:33:44] pyzozord: yes of course it does :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:33:47] as in handbook.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:34:02] same root as main or hand on deck.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:34:07] to be counted.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:34:22] arahael: Nope. they sound considerably different.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:34:27] vdamewood: Ah, nevermind then!
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:34:41] arahael: You know the difference between the k and w sounds, right?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[09:34:56] vdamewood: Yes, there's a *very slight* difference. ;)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:34:56] arahael: that is very much only hypothesis.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:35:12] most of linguists is.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:35:28] this is why I love etymology, it adds science to linguistics.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:36:07] arahael: With that winky I can't tell if your joking or not.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:36:09] arguably, wo relates also to both wood and Chinese wu
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:36:35] and there is a reason to link them, in the cultural science and beliefs of the time.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[09:36:37] looking up where words came from is fun :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:36:38] Wu means nothing to me.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:37:24] wu is to be a leader, you could liken that to wo of wode, and to the matriarchal culture that existed when the word woman may have been coined.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:38:52] of course to a roman, that would be very different, and perceived in a very different light, the Romans were not fans of Boadicea.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:38:59] wo betide them!
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[09:40:27] "Romanes Eunt Domus EXPLAINED | Monty Python's Life of Brian • Fun with Latin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfH6gjxTTgE
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:41:51] :D Not sure that this latin would have existed at that time though, it was developed far later, would have been vulgar (no offence to the vulgar people) at that time. :P
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:43:09] such vulgar people <- Very non PC!
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:43:23] PC <- Oxymoron.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:43:51] mrig: linguists describe, not prescribe, except when language is doing something really dumb and even then their idea still has to spread organically
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:44:09] immibis: not when studied as vedanga.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[09:44:32] you get to control the english language because of ... religious bullshit?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:44:48] immibis: religion has nothing to do with this.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:45:03] this is the grammar of pannini
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:46:00] to bring ones own beliefs into a discussion of a foreign culture is not wise.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:46:11] mrig: Sorry, that was meant as a pun. The character 無 is pronounced wú and means nothing.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:46:13] colours or taints the understanding.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:46:38] vdamewood: I thought that it was an ancient dialect.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:46:49] To old old hat.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:46:59] ops, to old hat perhaps.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:47:12] Well, that's modern Mandarin.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:47:12] Too <- silly lugwedge.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:47:28] ah modern linguistic entropy included.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:48:08] immibis: I am not interested by control in the slightest, are you?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[09:48:44] language is a beautiful ergonomic natural thing, I find it fascinating.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[09:54:08] Well, yay. I scratched myself on a screw in my bookshelf that's sticking up.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:04:03] I want to put gif/webp/mp4 animation in the background of my terminal, is ffmpeg the best way to do it? It seem so heavy and complex. Also I want to make the animation be mostly handled by the gpu to keep the cpu usage low
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:04:46] pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:05:30] arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[10:05:46] I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:06:07] I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:06:36] vdamewood: I checked I did see some "animated gif" in the ffmpeg docs, but I'm not sure that meant actual support
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:06:42] you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:07:03] pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:07:40] pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:07:46] ANd yes, mp4 is a container format.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:08:24] arahael: Well, I also meant to contrast it with a situation like Ogg, where pretty much overy Ogg video is Theora.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:08:41] Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:08:51] GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:08:59] Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[10:09:43] pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:09:59] pyzozord: I seem to recall that some SoC's do have hardware routines for video processing.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:10:10] To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:10:32] pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:10:41] GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:10:55] arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:11:01] h.264
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:11:03] arahael: nice thanks!
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:11:05] vdamewood: Probably.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[10:11:21] Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:11:28] pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:11:39] pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:11:40] arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[10:11:51] We already have H265 and they're working on H266
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:11:52] It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:12:15] GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:12:17] vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:12:31] I think decoding gifs in GPU shaders is a good idea, I doubt there is any dedicated hardware to gifs :D
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[10:13:01] it might not be possible. The LZW compression used by GIF is inherently sequential
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:13:22] According to https://larryjordan.com/articles/apple-adds-hardware-to-improve-video-compression-speeds/ the M1 can do  H.264, 8-bit HEVC, and 10-bit HEVC using hardware encoding in hardware.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[10:13:26] (you can have sequential dedicated hardware that may be faster than a CPU, but you can't parallelize it by running it on a GPU)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:14:27] immibis: thanks, that's valuable comment
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:14:45] pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:15:39] Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:15:54] hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[10:15:57] Depends how they;'re defining a core
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[10:16:35] The easiest way would be to use an atlas of the frames and just switch between them
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:16:38] pyzozord: (j/k) Solid black?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:17:04] vdamewood: doing 0.8 alpha black now :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[10:17:27] pyzozord: least amount of energy? don't animate your terminal backgrounds
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:17:32] Does RAM use moe energy if you store more in it, or is it using 100% power consumption no matter what's loaded?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:17:42] immibis: *with the fancy animated background
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:18:43] vdamewood: I'm not sure but I think ram needs refreshing to not corrupt
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:19:15] vdamewood: but there could be some clever algorithms keeping track of which banks have any data stored, and banks that have no data stored don't get refreshed
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:19:33] So, I guess the question becomes, does that happen?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:19:53] And I left ##hardware in the migration.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:20:09] vdamewood: They moved here, too.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[10:20:31] vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pulse	[10:20:40] the big IRC migration of 2021, i will tell my grandsons about it
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:20:56] pulse: You will have grandsons?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pulse	[10:21:01] assuming i ever have grandsons
2021-07-17 19:43:52	immibis	[10:21:02] i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:21:32] Hmm this gives me some ideas. I guess I should just check what my hardware supports and find a way to make use of that. I got a lenovo thinkpad x230 from 2012, with old i5 and integrated intel graphics, so whatever my device has I guess there is a reasonable chance it's wide spread
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:21:59] pyzozord; Too bad it can't run Windows 11.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:23:10] This may be the first time in a long time that I finally have copies of two versions of Windows in a row.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:23:25] I went from 3.1 to 98 to XP to 7 to 10.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:23:30] vdamewood: it can't? I think I ran windows 11 two weeks ago for a moment to check some driver issues on linux. But not sure if that was windows 11 or 10
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:24:00] pyzozord: Did you sign up for the Insiders' program, and download a beta?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:24:15] oh than no, I download whatever was publically available
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:24:23] 10
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:24:49] This reminds me that I still don't have an ISO of win 10 to run as a VM.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:24:58] sorry, I lost track of windowses. Yeah I gues it was 10. It was looking pretty fancy so I thought it was the newest
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:25:20] on my todo list to get one of those :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:25:30] mrig: Visit this link in a non-Windows OS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:25:53] (If you use Windows, that page will redirect you to the media creation tool.)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:26:12] pyzozord: It is. 11 is still beta.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:26:27] 11 Won't be released until later this year.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:26:45] the page wont open :(
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:27:01] mrig: OS and browser?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:27:31] the browser, seems that all of my add blockers and malicious script blockers have been set off.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	vdamewood	[10:28:00] Yeah, I can't really help with that.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:29:25] just had to go through and slowly allow things until it works, a bit of a pain in the ass.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:30:44] cool, I've got one downloading.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:31:08] not sure if I'll be able to get my licence number and use that or not though.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:31:25] It would be cool to figure out video. I'd love to make games with that technology that Blade Runner had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkwpa5YPhx8
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:31:44] must be a way to do that on a vm, if you've got an original install image.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[10:32:07] It had like video backgrounds but those clips had also depth and lighting information, so it integrated fantastically with the characters
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:33:56] oh cool; I'd no idea that the game existed!

2021-07-17 19:43:52	Intelo	[10:36:43] having one Entity table with type=person, animal, metal, plastic      or   have 4 tables  separately named person, animal, metal, plastic?   The pros/cons I see in first strategy is that if I need to add address, I can just add one address table mapping to enttiy but con is there one additional `where` clause needed to fine type.  while in second
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Intelo	[10:36:44] strategy, no need for that. but in second, I have to make 4 address tables also. Any views?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	furrymcgee	[10:39:31] probably five tables/relations
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pulse	[10:39:34] that's a bit like asking what's better, a big bucket of water of 4 small buckets of water
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pulse	[10:39:46] which is better depends on context i'd say
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pulse	[10:40:11] are you going to be accessing all data on each query, or just one type of data
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[10:46:53] That must have been so satisfying to have worked on at the time, the bladerunner game.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Intelo	[10:50:34] pulse just one type

2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-17 19:43:52	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-17 19:43:52	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-17 19:43:52	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-17 19:43:52	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Intelo	[11:29:18] pulse This https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit?usp=sharing
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:29:24] h0gan: that's a good place to be in imo
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:29:37] h0gan: I'll need to learn read an MBA book myself
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:29:43] wow, this medium.com site does not even scroll correctly.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-17 19:43:52	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-17 19:43:52	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-17 19:43:52	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-17 19:43:52	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-17 19:43:52	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-17 19:43:52	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-17 19:43:52	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-17 19:43:52	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.

2021-07-17 19:43:52	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.

2021-07-17 19:55:08	mrig	it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-17 19:56:18	pyzozord	yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything

2021-07-17 23:35:18	teut	[08:41:10] i recently only saw this word in some docs
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[08:41:29] teut: you should really get familiar with man
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[08:41:43] teut: start with man man
2021-07-17 23:35:18	teut	[08:42:52] ya , I ll see
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[08:43:27] teut: then you will be able to man fork or man wait, that what I did to try and help you
2021-07-17 23:35:18	teut	[08:46:34] HELP is the equivalent Windows command for man.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:04:49] main
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-17 23:35:18	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	 *	pyzozord [09:06:13] types "man mrig"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	vdamewood	[09:06:19] Who said it was being coverned by a dictator?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:06:58] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept. <- whos dictum?
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-17 23:35:18	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-17 23:35:18	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-17 23:35:18	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-17 23:35:18	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-17 23:35:18	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-17 23:35:18	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-17 23:35:18	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-17 23:35:18	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[09:30:44] Percussionist who is also deaf
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:30:53] So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:31:04] Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:31:15] immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:31:24] ?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:31:50] And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:32:32] vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:32:46] arahael: She has been deaf since birth and was initially rejected by the academy of music on this premise, She then proceeded to point out to the board members what was wrong with their musical notation system and how it failed to annotate the majority of the nuances that she could perceive.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[09:32:52] In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:32:57] arahael: I don't follow your logic?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:33:08] a xylophonist yes, highly skilled deaf musician.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:33:19] pyzozord: To be honest, i thought the original comment was just meant to be a pun.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:33:24] vdamewood: Ah, I thought it might sound almost the same.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:33:26] she made the academy panel look dumb, and rather deaf.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:33:43] Also, for what it's worth the word manual comes from the latun word for 'hand'.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:33:44] pyzozord: yes of course it does :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:33:47] as in handbook.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:34:02] same root as main or hand on deck.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:34:07] to be counted.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:34:22] arahael: Nope. they sound considerably different.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:34:27] vdamewood: Ah, nevermind then!
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:34:41] arahael: You know the difference between the k and w sounds, right?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[09:34:56] vdamewood: Yes, there's a *very slight* difference. ;)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:34:56] arahael: that is very much only hypothesis.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:35:12] most of linguists is.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:35:28] this is why I love etymology, it adds science to linguistics.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:36:07] arahael: With that winky I can't tell if your joking or not.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:36:09] arguably, wo relates also to both wood and Chinese wu
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:36:35] and there is a reason to link them, in the cultural science and beliefs of the time.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[09:36:37] looking up where words came from is fun :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:36:38] Wu means nothing to me.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:37:24] wu is to be a leader, you could liken that to wo of wode, and to the matriarchal culture that existed when the word woman may have been coined.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:38:52] of course to a roman, that would be very different, and perceived in a very different light, the Romans were not fans of Boadicea.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:38:59] wo betide them!
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[09:40:27] "Romanes Eunt Domus EXPLAINED | Monty Python's Life of Brian • Fun with Latin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfH6gjxTTgE
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:41:51] :D Not sure that this latin would have existed at that time though, it was developed far later, would have been vulgar (no offence to the vulgar people) at that time. :P
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:43:09] such vulgar people <- Very non PC!
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:43:23] PC <- Oxymoron.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:43:51] mrig: linguists describe, not prescribe, except when language is doing something really dumb and even then their idea still has to spread organically
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:44:09] immibis: not when studied as vedanga.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[09:44:32] you get to control the english language because of ... religious bullshit?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:44:48] immibis: religion has nothing to do with this.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:45:03] this is the grammar of pannini
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:46:00] to bring ones own beliefs into a discussion of a foreign culture is not wise.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:46:11] mrig: Sorry, that was meant as a pun. The character 無 is pronounced wú and means nothing.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:46:13] colours or taints the understanding.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:46:38] vdamewood: I thought that it was an ancient dialect.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:46:49] To old old hat.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:46:59] ops, to old hat perhaps.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:47:12] Well, that's modern Mandarin.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:47:12] Too <- silly lugwedge.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:47:28] ah modern linguistic entropy included.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:48:08] immibis: I am not interested by control in the slightest, are you?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[09:48:44] language is a beautiful ergonomic natural thing, I find it fascinating.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[09:54:08] Well, yay. I scratched myself on a screw in my bookshelf that's sticking up.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:04:03] I want to put gif/webp/mp4 animation in the background of my terminal, is ffmpeg the best way to do it? It seem so heavy and complex. Also I want to make the animation be mostly handled by the gpu to keep the cpu usage low
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:04:46] pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:05:30] arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[10:05:46] I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:06:07] I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:06:36] vdamewood: I checked I did see some "animated gif" in the ffmpeg docs, but I'm not sure that meant actual support
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:06:42] you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:07:03] pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:07:40] pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:07:46] ANd yes, mp4 is a container format.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:08:24] arahael: Well, I also meant to contrast it with a situation like Ogg, where pretty much overy Ogg video is Theora.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:08:41] Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:08:51] GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:08:59] Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[10:09:43] pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:09:59] pyzozord: I seem to recall that some SoC's do have hardware routines for video processing.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:10:10] To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:10:32] pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:10:41] GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:10:55] arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:11:01] h.264
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:11:03] arahael: nice thanks!
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:11:05] vdamewood: Probably.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[10:11:21] Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:11:28] pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:11:39] pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:11:40] arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[10:11:51] We already have H265 and they're working on H266
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:11:52] It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:12:15] GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:12:17] vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:12:31] I think decoding gifs in GPU shaders is a good idea, I doubt there is any dedicated hardware to gifs :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[10:13:01] it might not be possible. The LZW compression used by GIF is inherently sequential
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:13:22] According to https://larryjordan.com/articles/apple-adds-hardware-to-improve-video-compression-speeds/ the M1 can do  H.264, 8-bit HEVC, and 10-bit HEVC using hardware encoding in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[10:13:26] (you can have sequential dedicated hardware that may be faster than a CPU, but you can't parallelize it by running it on a GPU)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:14:27] immibis: thanks, that's valuable comment
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:14:45] pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:15:39] Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:15:54] hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[10:15:57] Depends how they;'re defining a core
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[10:16:35] The easiest way would be to use an atlas of the frames and just switch between them
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:16:38] pyzozord: (j/k) Solid black?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:17:04] vdamewood: doing 0.8 alpha black now :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[10:17:27] pyzozord: least amount of energy? don't animate your terminal backgrounds
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:17:32] Does RAM use moe energy if you store more in it, or is it using 100% power consumption no matter what's loaded?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:17:42] immibis: *with the fancy animated background
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:18:43] vdamewood: I'm not sure but I think ram needs refreshing to not corrupt
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:19:15] vdamewood: but there could be some clever algorithms keeping track of which banks have any data stored, and banks that have no data stored don't get refreshed
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:19:33] So, I guess the question becomes, does that happen?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:19:53] And I left ##hardware in the migration.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:20:09] vdamewood: They moved here, too.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[10:20:31] vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[10:20:40] the big IRC migration of 2021, i will tell my grandsons about it
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:20:56] pulse: You will have grandsons?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[10:21:01] assuming i ever have grandsons
2021-07-17 23:35:19	immibis	[10:21:02] i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:21:32] Hmm this gives me some ideas. I guess I should just check what my hardware supports and find a way to make use of that. I got a lenovo thinkpad x230 from 2012, with old i5 and integrated intel graphics, so whatever my device has I guess there is a reasonable chance it's wide spread
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:21:59] pyzozord; Too bad it can't run Windows 11.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:23:10] This may be the first time in a long time that I finally have copies of two versions of Windows in a row.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:23:25] I went from 3.1 to 98 to XP to 7 to 10.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:23:30] vdamewood: it can't? I think I ran windows 11 two weeks ago for a moment to check some driver issues on linux. But not sure if that was windows 11 or 10
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:24:00] pyzozord: Did you sign up for the Insiders' program, and download a beta?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:24:15] oh than no, I download whatever was publically available
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:24:23] 10
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:24:49] This reminds me that I still don't have an ISO of win 10 to run as a VM.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:24:58] sorry, I lost track of windowses. Yeah I gues it was 10. It was looking pretty fancy so I thought it was the newest
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:25:20] on my todo list to get one of those :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:25:30] mrig: Visit this link in a non-Windows OS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:25:53] (If you use Windows, that page will redirect you to the media creation tool.)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:26:12] pyzozord: It is. 11 is still beta.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:26:27] 11 Won't be released until later this year.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:26:45] the page wont open :(
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:27:01] mrig: OS and browser?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:27:31] the browser, seems that all of my add blockers and malicious script blockers have been set off.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	vdamewood	[10:28:00] Yeah, I can't really help with that.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:29:25] just had to go through and slowly allow things until it works, a bit of a pain in the ass.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:30:44] cool, I've got one downloading.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:31:08] not sure if I'll be able to get my licence number and use that or not though.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:31:25] It would be cool to figure out video. I'd love to make games with that technology that Blade Runner had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkwpa5YPhx8
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:31:44] must be a way to do that on a vm, if you've got an original install image.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[10:32:07] It had like video backgrounds but those clips had also depth and lighting information, so it integrated fantastically with the characters
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:33:56] oh cool; I'd no idea that the game existed!

2021-07-17 23:35:19	Intelo	[10:36:43] having one Entity table with type=person, animal, metal, plastic      or   have 4 tables  separately named person, animal, metal, plastic?   The pros/cons I see in first strategy is that if I need to add address, I can just add one address table mapping to enttiy but con is there one additional `where` clause needed to fine type.  while in second
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Intelo	[10:36:44] strategy, no need for that. but in second, I have to make 4 address tables also. Any views?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	furrymcgee	[10:39:31] probably five tables/relations
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[10:39:34] that's a bit like asking what's better, a big bucket of water of 4 small buckets of water
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[10:39:46] which is better depends on context i'd say
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[10:40:11] are you going to be accessing all data on each query, or just one type of data
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[10:46:53] That must have been so satisfying to have worked on at the time, the bladerunner game.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Intelo	[10:50:34] pulse just one type
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:04:17] wow, I can't believe how much juice it takes to simply read a page on medium.com sites.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:04:43] I wonder if some script is being blocked and that is putting it into some perpetual loop.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:05:11] If not that, they must be crypto mining on my resources :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:06:27] mrig: This is why I'm very interested in Gemini. :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:06:59] yes does make it all the more appealing.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:07:31] this site is running one of my processors at almost 100% all of the time, does anyone else have the same experience?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:08:08] nothing on my system in my day to day use requires this much processing power :|
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:08:33] Youtube puts a load on my machine
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-17 23:35:19	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-17 23:35:19	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-17 23:35:19	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-17 23:35:19	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone

2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-17 23:35:19	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-17 23:35:19	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-17 23:35:19	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-17 23:35:19	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-17 23:35:19	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-17 23:35:19	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-17 23:35:19	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-17 23:35:19	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.

2021-07-17 23:35:19	Mangy_Dog	[15:56:20] https://imgur.com/a/YzOetBF because of the size of the graphic asset i think. Its causing some kind of over load somewhere in the image buffer... So i had to cut back a bit on the fading scan effect making it corser

2021-07-17 23:37:27	teut	[08:41:10] i recently only saw this word in some docs
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[08:41:29] teut: you should really get familiar with man
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[08:41:43] teut: start with man man
2021-07-17 23:37:27	teut	[08:42:52] ya , I ll see
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[08:43:27] teut: then you will be able to man fork or man wait, that what I did to try and help you
2021-07-17 23:37:27	teut	[08:46:34] HELP is the equivalent Windows command for man.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:04:49] main
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-17 23:37:27	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	 *	pyzozord [09:06:13] types "man mrig"
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:06:19] Who said it was being coverned by a dictator?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:06:58] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept. <- whos dictum?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[09:30:44] Percussionist who is also deaf
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:30:53] So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:31:04] Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:31:15] immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:31:24] ?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:31:50] And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:32:32] vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:32:46] arahael: She has been deaf since birth and was initially rejected by the academy of music on this premise, She then proceeded to point out to the board members what was wrong with their musical notation system and how it failed to annotate the majority of the nuances that she could perceive.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:32:52] In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:32:57] arahael: I don't follow your logic?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:33:08] a xylophonist yes, highly skilled deaf musician.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:33:19] pyzozord: To be honest, i thought the original comment was just meant to be a pun.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:33:24] vdamewood: Ah, I thought it might sound almost the same.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:33:26] she made the academy panel look dumb, and rather deaf.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:33:43] Also, for what it's worth the word manual comes from the latun word for 'hand'.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:33:44] pyzozord: yes of course it does :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:33:47] as in handbook.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:34:02] same root as main or hand on deck.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:34:07] to be counted.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:34:22] arahael: Nope. they sound considerably different.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:34:27] vdamewood: Ah, nevermind then!
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:34:41] arahael: You know the difference between the k and w sounds, right?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[09:34:56] vdamewood: Yes, there's a *very slight* difference. ;)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:34:56] arahael: that is very much only hypothesis.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:35:12] most of linguists is.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:35:28] this is why I love etymology, it adds science to linguistics.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:36:07] arahael: With that winky I can't tell if your joking or not.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:36:09] arguably, wo relates also to both wood and Chinese wu
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:36:35] and there is a reason to link them, in the cultural science and beliefs of the time.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[09:36:37] looking up where words came from is fun :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:36:38] Wu means nothing to me.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:37:24] wu is to be a leader, you could liken that to wo of wode, and to the matriarchal culture that existed when the word woman may have been coined.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:38:52] of course to a roman, that would be very different, and perceived in a very different light, the Romans were not fans of Boadicea.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:38:59] wo betide them!
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[09:40:27] "Romanes Eunt Domus EXPLAINED | Monty Python's Life of Brian • Fun with Latin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfH6gjxTTgE
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:41:51] :D Not sure that this latin would have existed at that time though, it was developed far later, would have been vulgar (no offence to the vulgar people) at that time. :P
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:43:09] such vulgar people <- Very non PC!
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:43:23] PC <- Oxymoron.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:43:51] mrig: linguists describe, not prescribe, except when language is doing something really dumb and even then their idea still has to spread organically
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:44:09] immibis: not when studied as vedanga.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[09:44:32] you get to control the english language because of ... religious bullshit?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:44:48] immibis: religion has nothing to do with this.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:45:03] this is the grammar of pannini
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:46:00] to bring ones own beliefs into a discussion of a foreign culture is not wise.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:46:11] mrig: Sorry, that was meant as a pun. The character 無 is pronounced wú and means nothing.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:46:13] colours or taints the understanding.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:46:38] vdamewood: I thought that it was an ancient dialect.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:46:49] To old old hat.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:46:59] ops, to old hat perhaps.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:47:12] Well, that's modern Mandarin.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:47:12] Too <- silly lugwedge.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:47:28] ah modern linguistic entropy included.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:48:08] immibis: I am not interested by control in the slightest, are you?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[09:48:44] language is a beautiful ergonomic natural thing, I find it fascinating.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[09:54:08] Well, yay. I scratched myself on a screw in my bookshelf that's sticking up.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:04:03] I want to put gif/webp/mp4 animation in the background of my terminal, is ffmpeg the best way to do it? It seem so heavy and complex. Also I want to make the animation be mostly handled by the gpu to keep the cpu usage low
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:04:46] pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:05:30] arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[10:05:46] I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:06:07] I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:06:36] vdamewood: I checked I did see some "animated gif" in the ffmpeg docs, but I'm not sure that meant actual support
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:06:42] you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:07:03] pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:07:40] pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:07:46] ANd yes, mp4 is a container format.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:08:24] arahael: Well, I also meant to contrast it with a situation like Ogg, where pretty much overy Ogg video is Theora.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:08:41] Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:08:51] GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:08:59] Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[10:09:43] pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:09:59] pyzozord: I seem to recall that some SoC's do have hardware routines for video processing.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:10:10] To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:10:32] pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:10:41] GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:10:55] arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:11:01] h.264
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:11:03] arahael: nice thanks!
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:11:05] vdamewood: Probably.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[10:11:21] Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:11:28] pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:11:39] pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:11:40] arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[10:11:51] We already have H265 and they're working on H266
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:11:52] It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:12:15] GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:12:17] vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:12:31] I think decoding gifs in GPU shaders is a good idea, I doubt there is any dedicated hardware to gifs :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[10:13:01] it might not be possible. The LZW compression used by GIF is inherently sequential
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:13:22] According to https://larryjordan.com/articles/apple-adds-hardware-to-improve-video-compression-speeds/ the M1 can do  H.264, 8-bit HEVC, and 10-bit HEVC using hardware encoding in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[10:13:26] (you can have sequential dedicated hardware that may be faster than a CPU, but you can't parallelize it by running it on a GPU)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:14:27] immibis: thanks, that's valuable comment
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:14:45] pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:15:39] Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:15:54] hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[10:15:57] Depends how they;'re defining a core
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[10:16:35] The easiest way would be to use an atlas of the frames and just switch between them
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:16:38] pyzozord: (j/k) Solid black?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:17:04] vdamewood: doing 0.8 alpha black now :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[10:17:27] pyzozord: least amount of energy? don't animate your terminal backgrounds
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:17:32] Does RAM use moe energy if you store more in it, or is it using 100% power consumption no matter what's loaded?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:17:42] immibis: *with the fancy animated background
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:18:43] vdamewood: I'm not sure but I think ram needs refreshing to not corrupt
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:19:15] vdamewood: but there could be some clever algorithms keeping track of which banks have any data stored, and banks that have no data stored don't get refreshed
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:19:33] So, I guess the question becomes, does that happen?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:19:53] And I left ##hardware in the migration.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:20:09] vdamewood: They moved here, too.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[10:20:31] vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[10:20:40] the big IRC migration of 2021, i will tell my grandsons about it
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:20:56] pulse: You will have grandsons?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[10:21:01] assuming i ever have grandsons
2021-07-17 23:37:27	immibis	[10:21:02] i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:21:32] Hmm this gives me some ideas. I guess I should just check what my hardware supports and find a way to make use of that. I got a lenovo thinkpad x230 from 2012, with old i5 and integrated intel graphics, so whatever my device has I guess there is a reasonable chance it's wide spread
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:21:59] pyzozord; Too bad it can't run Windows 11.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:23:10] This may be the first time in a long time that I finally have copies of two versions of Windows in a row.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:23:25] I went from 3.1 to 98 to XP to 7 to 10.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:23:30] vdamewood: it can't? I think I ran windows 11 two weeks ago for a moment to check some driver issues on linux. But not sure if that was windows 11 or 10
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:24:00] pyzozord: Did you sign up for the Insiders' program, and download a beta?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:24:15] oh than no, I download whatever was publically available
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:24:23] 10
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:24:49] This reminds me that I still don't have an ISO of win 10 to run as a VM.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:24:58] sorry, I lost track of windowses. Yeah I gues it was 10. It was looking pretty fancy so I thought it was the newest
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:25:20] on my todo list to get one of those :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:25:30] mrig: Visit this link in a non-Windows OS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:25:53] (If you use Windows, that page will redirect you to the media creation tool.)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:26:12] pyzozord: It is. 11 is still beta.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:26:27] 11 Won't be released until later this year.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:26:45] the page wont open :(
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:27:01] mrig: OS and browser?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:27:31] the browser, seems that all of my add blockers and malicious script blockers have been set off.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	vdamewood	[10:28:00] Yeah, I can't really help with that.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:29:25] just had to go through and slowly allow things until it works, a bit of a pain in the ass.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:30:44] cool, I've got one downloading.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:31:08] not sure if I'll be able to get my licence number and use that or not though.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:31:25] It would be cool to figure out video. I'd love to make games with that technology that Blade Runner had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkwpa5YPhx8
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:31:44] must be a way to do that on a vm, if you've got an original install image.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:32:07] It had like video backgrounds but those clips had also depth and lighting information, so it integrated fantastically with the characters
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:33:56] oh cool; I'd no idea that the game existed!
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[10:35:07] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goovFvN1hns
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[10:35:15] [Every Old School Computer Game]
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[10:36:09] pulse: heheh :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Intelo	[10:36:43] having one Entity table with type=person, animal, metal, plastic      or   have 4 tables  separately named person, animal, metal, plastic?   The pros/cons I see in first strategy is that if I need to add address, I can just add one address table mapping to enttiy but con is there one additional `where` clause needed to fine type.  while in second
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Intelo	[10:36:44] strategy, no need for that. but in second, I have to make 4 address tables also. Any views?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	furrymcgee	[10:39:31] probably five tables/relations
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[10:39:34] that's a bit like asking what's better, a big bucket of water of 4 small buckets of water
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[10:39:46] which is better depends on context i'd say
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[10:40:11] are you going to be accessing all data on each query, or just one type of data
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[10:46:53] That must have been so satisfying to have worked on at the time, the bladerunner game.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Intelo	[10:50:34] pulse just one type
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:04:17] wow, I can't believe how much juice it takes to simply read a page on medium.com sites.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:04:43] I wonder if some script is being blocked and that is putting it into some perpetual loop.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:05:11] If not that, they must be crypto mining on my resources :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:06:27] mrig: This is why I'm very interested in Gemini. :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:06:59] yes does make it all the more appealing.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:07:31] this site is running one of my processors at almost 100% all of the time, does anyone else have the same experience?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:08:08] nothing on my system in my day to day use requires this much processing power :|
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:08:33] Youtube puts a load on my machine
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-17 23:37:27	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-17 23:37:27	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-17 23:37:27	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-17 23:37:27	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Intelo	[11:29:18] pulse This https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit?usp=sharing
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:29:24] h0gan: that's a good place to be in imo
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:29:37] h0gan: I'll need to learn read an MBA book myself
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:29:43] wow, this medium.com site does not even scroll correctly.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-17 23:37:27	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-17 23:37:27	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-17 23:37:27	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-17 23:37:27	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-17 23:37:27	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.

2021-07-17 23:37:27	freshgumbubbles4	[15:51:29] Go check up with the operators of the respective proxies
2021-07-17 23:37:27	Mangy_Dog	[15:56:20] https://imgur.com/a/YzOetBF because of the size of the graphic asset i think. Its causing some kind of over load somewhere in the image buffer... So i had to cut back a bit on the fading scan effect making it corser
2021-07-17 23:37:27	meleoron	[17:29:49] is there an easy way to get the oldest releases of popular C programs like GCC or GNU Emacs?
2021-07-17 23:37:27	edgar-rft	[17:34:29] I think wikipedia can tell you that

2021-07-17 23:37:27	novns	[17:42:02] meleoron, look at USENET comp.sources.*
2021-07-17 23:37:27	novns	[17:42:17] where things were posted those days
2021-07-17 23:37:27	mrig	[17:42:54] This could be a good place to look too https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/old-releases/

2021-07-17 23:53:30	pyzozord	[08:41:43] teut: start with man man
2021-07-17 23:53:30	teut	[08:42:52] ya , I ll see
2021-07-17 23:53:30	pyzozord	[08:43:27] teut: then you will be able to man fork or man wait, that what I did to try and help you
2021-07-17 23:53:30	teut	[08:46:34] HELP is the equivalent Windows command for man.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-17 23:53:30	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-17 23:53:30	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.

2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-17 23:53:30	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.

2021-07-17 23:53:30	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"

2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-17 23:53:30	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[09:30:44] Percussionist who is also deaf
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:30:53] So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:31:04] Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:31:15] immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:31:24] ?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:31:50] And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:32:32] vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:32:46] arahael: She has been deaf since birth and was initially rejected by the academy of music on this premise, She then proceeded to point out to the board members what was wrong with their musical notation system and how it failed to annotate the majority of the nuances that she could perceive.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:32:52] In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:32:57] arahael: I don't follow your logic?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:33:08] a xylophonist yes, highly skilled deaf musician.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:33:19] pyzozord: To be honest, i thought the original comment was just meant to be a pun.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:33:24] vdamewood: Ah, I thought it might sound almost the same.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:33:26] she made the academy panel look dumb, and rather deaf.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:33:43] Also, for what it's worth the word manual comes from the latun word for 'hand'.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:33:44] pyzozord: yes of course it does :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:33:47] as in handbook.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:34:02] same root as main or hand on deck.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:34:07] to be counted.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:34:22] arahael: Nope. they sound considerably different.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:34:27] vdamewood: Ah, nevermind then!
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:34:41] arahael: You know the difference between the k and w sounds, right?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[09:34:56] vdamewood: Yes, there's a *very slight* difference. ;)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:34:56] arahael: that is very much only hypothesis.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:35:12] most of linguists is.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:35:28] this is why I love etymology, it adds science to linguistics.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:36:07] arahael: With that winky I can't tell if your joking or not.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:36:09] arguably, wo relates also to both wood and Chinese wu
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:36:35] and there is a reason to link them, in the cultural science and beliefs of the time.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[09:36:37] looking up where words came from is fun :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:36:38] Wu means nothing to me.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:37:24] wu is to be a leader, you could liken that to wo of wode, and to the matriarchal culture that existed when the word woman may have been coined.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:38:52] of course to a roman, that would be very different, and perceived in a very different light, the Romans were not fans of Boadicea.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:38:59] wo betide them!
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[09:40:27] "Romanes Eunt Domus EXPLAINED | Monty Python's Life of Brian • Fun with Latin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfH6gjxTTgE
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:41:51] :D Not sure that this latin would have existed at that time though, it was developed far later, would have been vulgar (no offence to the vulgar people) at that time. :P
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:43:09] such vulgar people <- Very non PC!
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:43:23] PC <- Oxymoron.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:43:51] mrig: linguists describe, not prescribe, except when language is doing something really dumb and even then their idea still has to spread organically
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:44:09] immibis: not when studied as vedanga.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[09:44:32] you get to control the english language because of ... religious bullshit?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:44:48] immibis: religion has nothing to do with this.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:45:03] this is the grammar of pannini
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:46:00] to bring ones own beliefs into a discussion of a foreign culture is not wise.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:46:11] mrig: Sorry, that was meant as a pun. The character 無 is pronounced wú and means nothing.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:46:13] colours or taints the understanding.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:46:38] vdamewood: I thought that it was an ancient dialect.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:46:49] To old old hat.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:46:59] ops, to old hat perhaps.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:47:12] Well, that's modern Mandarin.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:47:12] Too <- silly lugwedge.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:47:28] ah modern linguistic entropy included.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:48:08] immibis: I am not interested by control in the slightest, are you?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[09:48:44] language is a beautiful ergonomic natural thing, I find it fascinating.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[09:54:08] Well, yay. I scratched myself on a screw in my bookshelf that's sticking up.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:04:03] I want to put gif/webp/mp4 animation in the background of my terminal, is ffmpeg the best way to do it? It seem so heavy and complex. Also I want to make the animation be mostly handled by the gpu to keep the cpu usage low
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:04:46] pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:05:30] arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[10:05:46] I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:06:07] I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:06:36] vdamewood: I checked I did see some "animated gif" in the ffmpeg docs, but I'm not sure that meant actual support
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:06:42] you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:07:03] pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:07:40] pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:07:46] ANd yes, mp4 is a container format.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:08:24] arahael: Well, I also meant to contrast it with a situation like Ogg, where pretty much overy Ogg video is Theora.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:08:41] Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:08:51] GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:08:59] Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[10:09:43] pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:09:59] pyzozord: I seem to recall that some SoC's do have hardware routines for video processing.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:10:10] To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:10:32] pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:10:41] GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:10:55] arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:11:01] h.264
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:11:03] arahael: nice thanks!
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:11:05] vdamewood: Probably.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[10:11:21] Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:11:28] pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:11:39] pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:11:40] arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[10:11:51] We already have H265 and they're working on H266
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:11:52] It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:12:15] GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:12:17] vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:12:31] I think decoding gifs in GPU shaders is a good idea, I doubt there is any dedicated hardware to gifs :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[10:13:01] it might not be possible. The LZW compression used by GIF is inherently sequential
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:13:22] According to https://larryjordan.com/articles/apple-adds-hardware-to-improve-video-compression-speeds/ the M1 can do  H.264, 8-bit HEVC, and 10-bit HEVC using hardware encoding in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[10:13:26] (you can have sequential dedicated hardware that may be faster than a CPU, but you can't parallelize it by running it on a GPU)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:14:27] immibis: thanks, that's valuable comment
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:14:45] pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:15:39] Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:15:54] hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[10:15:57] Depends how they;'re defining a core
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[10:16:35] The easiest way would be to use an atlas of the frames and just switch between them
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:16:38] pyzozord: (j/k) Solid black?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:17:04] vdamewood: doing 0.8 alpha black now :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[10:17:27] pyzozord: least amount of energy? don't animate your terminal backgrounds
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:17:32] Does RAM use moe energy if you store more in it, or is it using 100% power consumption no matter what's loaded?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:17:42] immibis: *with the fancy animated background
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:18:43] vdamewood: I'm not sure but I think ram needs refreshing to not corrupt
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:19:15] vdamewood: but there could be some clever algorithms keeping track of which banks have any data stored, and banks that have no data stored don't get refreshed
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:19:33] So, I guess the question becomes, does that happen?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:19:53] And I left ##hardware in the migration.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:20:09] vdamewood: They moved here, too.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[10:20:31] vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[10:20:40] the big IRC migration of 2021, i will tell my grandsons about it
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:20:56] pulse: You will have grandsons?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[10:21:01] assuming i ever have grandsons
2021-07-17 23:53:31	immibis	[10:21:02] i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:21:32] Hmm this gives me some ideas. I guess I should just check what my hardware supports and find a way to make use of that. I got a lenovo thinkpad x230 from 2012, with old i5 and integrated intel graphics, so whatever my device has I guess there is a reasonable chance it's wide spread
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:21:59] pyzozord; Too bad it can't run Windows 11.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:23:10] This may be the first time in a long time that I finally have copies of two versions of Windows in a row.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:23:25] I went from 3.1 to 98 to XP to 7 to 10.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:23:30] vdamewood: it can't? I think I ran windows 11 two weeks ago for a moment to check some driver issues on linux. But not sure if that was windows 11 or 10
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:24:00] pyzozord: Did you sign up for the Insiders' program, and download a beta?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:24:15] oh than no, I download whatever was publically available
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:24:23] 10
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:24:49] This reminds me that I still don't have an ISO of win 10 to run as a VM.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:24:58] sorry, I lost track of windowses. Yeah I gues it was 10. It was looking pretty fancy so I thought it was the newest
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:25:20] on my todo list to get one of those :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:25:30] mrig: Visit this link in a non-Windows OS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:25:53] (If you use Windows, that page will redirect you to the media creation tool.)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:26:12] pyzozord: It is. 11 is still beta.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:26:27] 11 Won't be released until later this year.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:26:45] the page wont open :(
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:27:01] mrig: OS and browser?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:27:31] the browser, seems that all of my add blockers and malicious script blockers have been set off.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	vdamewood	[10:28:00] Yeah, I can't really help with that.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:29:25] just had to go through and slowly allow things until it works, a bit of a pain in the ass.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:30:44] cool, I've got one downloading.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:31:08] not sure if I'll be able to get my licence number and use that or not though.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:31:25] It would be cool to figure out video. I'd love to make games with that technology that Blade Runner had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkwpa5YPhx8
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:31:44] must be a way to do that on a vm, if you've got an original install image.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:32:07] It had like video backgrounds but those clips had also depth and lighting information, so it integrated fantastically with the characters
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:33:56] oh cool; I'd no idea that the game existed!
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[10:35:07] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goovFvN1hns

2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[10:36:09] pulse: heheh :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Intelo	[10:36:43] having one Entity table with type=person, animal, metal, plastic      or   have 4 tables  separately named person, animal, metal, plastic?   The pros/cons I see in first strategy is that if I need to add address, I can just add one address table mapping to enttiy but con is there one additional `where` clause needed to fine type.  while in second
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Intelo	[10:36:44] strategy, no need for that. but in second, I have to make 4 address tables also. Any views?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	furrymcgee	[10:39:31] probably five tables/relations
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[10:39:34] that's a bit like asking what's better, a big bucket of water of 4 small buckets of water
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[10:39:46] which is better depends on context i'd say
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[10:40:11] are you going to be accessing all data on each query, or just one type of data
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[10:46:53] That must have been so satisfying to have worked on at the time, the bladerunner game.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Intelo	[10:50:34] pulse just one type
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:04:17] wow, I can't believe how much juice it takes to simply read a page on medium.com sites.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:04:43] I wonder if some script is being blocked and that is putting it into some perpetual loop.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:05:11] If not that, they must be crypto mining on my resources :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:06:27] mrig: This is why I'm very interested in Gemini. :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:06:59] yes does make it all the more appealing.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:07:31] this site is running one of my processors at almost 100% all of the time, does anyone else have the same experience?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:08:08] nothing on my system in my day to day use requires this much processing power :|
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:08:33] Youtube puts a load on my machine
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-17 23:53:31	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-17 23:53:31	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-17 23:53:31	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-17 23:53:31	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone

2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk

2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-17 23:53:31	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-17 23:53:31	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-17 23:53:31	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-17 23:53:31	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-17 23:53:31	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-17 23:53:31	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-17 23:53:31	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-17 23:53:31	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.

2021-07-17 23:53:31	Mangy_Dog	[15:56:20] https://imgur.com/a/YzOetBF because of the size of the graphic asset i think. Its causing some kind of over load somewhere in the image buffer... So i had to cut back a bit on the fading scan effect making it corser

2021-07-17 23:54:17	teut	[08:42:52] ya , I ll see
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[08:43:27] teut: then you will be able to man fork or man wait, that what I did to try and help you
2021-07-17 23:54:17	teut	[08:46:34] HELP is the equivalent Windows command for man.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:04:49] main
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-17 23:54:17	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	 *	pyzozord [09:06:13] types "man mrig"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:06:19] Who said it was being coverned by a dictator?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:06:58] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept. <- whos dictum?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[09:30:44] Percussionist who is also deaf
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:30:53] So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:31:04] Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:31:15] immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:31:24] ?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:31:50] And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:32:32] vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:32:46] arahael: She has been deaf since birth and was initially rejected by the academy of music on this premise, She then proceeded to point out to the board members what was wrong with their musical notation system and how it failed to annotate the majority of the nuances that she could perceive.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:32:52] In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:32:57] arahael: I don't follow your logic?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:33:08] a xylophonist yes, highly skilled deaf musician.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:33:19] pyzozord: To be honest, i thought the original comment was just meant to be a pun.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:33:24] vdamewood: Ah, I thought it might sound almost the same.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:33:26] she made the academy panel look dumb, and rather deaf.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:33:43] Also, for what it's worth the word manual comes from the latun word for 'hand'.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:33:44] pyzozord: yes of course it does :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:33:47] as in handbook.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:34:02] same root as main or hand on deck.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:34:07] to be counted.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:34:22] arahael: Nope. they sound considerably different.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:34:27] vdamewood: Ah, nevermind then!
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:34:41] arahael: You know the difference between the k and w sounds, right?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[09:34:56] vdamewood: Yes, there's a *very slight* difference. ;)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:34:56] arahael: that is very much only hypothesis.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:35:12] most of linguists is.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:35:28] this is why I love etymology, it adds science to linguistics.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:36:07] arahael: With that winky I can't tell if your joking or not.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:36:09] arguably, wo relates also to both wood and Chinese wu
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:36:35] and there is a reason to link them, in the cultural science and beliefs of the time.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[09:36:37] looking up where words came from is fun :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:36:38] Wu means nothing to me.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:37:24] wu is to be a leader, you could liken that to wo of wode, and to the matriarchal culture that existed when the word woman may have been coined.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:38:52] of course to a roman, that would be very different, and perceived in a very different light, the Romans were not fans of Boadicea.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:38:59] wo betide them!
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[09:40:27] "Romanes Eunt Domus EXPLAINED | Monty Python's Life of Brian • Fun with Latin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfH6gjxTTgE
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:41:51] :D Not sure that this latin would have existed at that time though, it was developed far later, would have been vulgar (no offence to the vulgar people) at that time. :P
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:43:09] such vulgar people <- Very non PC!
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:43:23] PC <- Oxymoron.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:43:51] mrig: linguists describe, not prescribe, except when language is doing something really dumb and even then their idea still has to spread organically
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:44:09] immibis: not when studied as vedanga.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[09:44:32] you get to control the english language because of ... religious bullshit?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:44:48] immibis: religion has nothing to do with this.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:45:03] this is the grammar of pannini
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:46:00] to bring ones own beliefs into a discussion of a foreign culture is not wise.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:46:11] mrig: Sorry, that was meant as a pun. The character 無 is pronounced wú and means nothing.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:46:13] colours or taints the understanding.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:46:38] vdamewood: I thought that it was an ancient dialect.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:46:49] To old old hat.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:46:59] ops, to old hat perhaps.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:47:12] Well, that's modern Mandarin.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:47:12] Too <- silly lugwedge.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:47:28] ah modern linguistic entropy included.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:48:08] immibis: I am not interested by control in the slightest, are you?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[09:48:44] language is a beautiful ergonomic natural thing, I find it fascinating.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[09:54:08] Well, yay. I scratched myself on a screw in my bookshelf that's sticking up.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:04:03] I want to put gif/webp/mp4 animation in the background of my terminal, is ffmpeg the best way to do it? It seem so heavy and complex. Also I want to make the animation be mostly handled by the gpu to keep the cpu usage low
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:04:46] pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:05:30] arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[10:05:46] I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:06:07] I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:06:36] vdamewood: I checked I did see some "animated gif" in the ffmpeg docs, but I'm not sure that meant actual support
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:06:42] you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:07:03] pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:07:40] pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:07:46] ANd yes, mp4 is a container format.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:08:24] arahael: Well, I also meant to contrast it with a situation like Ogg, where pretty much overy Ogg video is Theora.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:08:41] Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:08:51] GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:08:59] Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[10:09:43] pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:09:59] pyzozord: I seem to recall that some SoC's do have hardware routines for video processing.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:10:10] To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:10:32] pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:10:41] GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:10:55] arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:11:01] h.264
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:11:03] arahael: nice thanks!
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:11:05] vdamewood: Probably.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[10:11:21] Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:11:28] pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:11:39] pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:11:40] arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[10:11:51] We already have H265 and they're working on H266
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:11:52] It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:12:15] GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:12:17] vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:12:31] I think decoding gifs in GPU shaders is a good idea, I doubt there is any dedicated hardware to gifs :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[10:13:01] it might not be possible. The LZW compression used by GIF is inherently sequential
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:13:22] According to https://larryjordan.com/articles/apple-adds-hardware-to-improve-video-compression-speeds/ the M1 can do  H.264, 8-bit HEVC, and 10-bit HEVC using hardware encoding in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[10:13:26] (you can have sequential dedicated hardware that may be faster than a CPU, but you can't parallelize it by running it on a GPU)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:14:27] immibis: thanks, that's valuable comment
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:14:45] pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:15:39] Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:15:54] hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[10:15:57] Depends how they;'re defining a core
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[10:16:35] The easiest way would be to use an atlas of the frames and just switch between them
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:16:38] pyzozord: (j/k) Solid black?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:17:04] vdamewood: doing 0.8 alpha black now :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[10:17:27] pyzozord: least amount of energy? don't animate your terminal backgrounds
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:17:32] Does RAM use moe energy if you store more in it, or is it using 100% power consumption no matter what's loaded?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:17:42] immibis: *with the fancy animated background
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:18:43] vdamewood: I'm not sure but I think ram needs refreshing to not corrupt
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:19:15] vdamewood: but there could be some clever algorithms keeping track of which banks have any data stored, and banks that have no data stored don't get refreshed
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:19:33] So, I guess the question becomes, does that happen?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:19:53] And I left ##hardware in the migration.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:20:09] vdamewood: They moved here, too.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[10:20:31] vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[10:20:40] the big IRC migration of 2021, i will tell my grandsons about it
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:20:56] pulse: You will have grandsons?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[10:21:01] assuming i ever have grandsons
2021-07-17 23:54:17	immibis	[10:21:02] i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:21:32] Hmm this gives me some ideas. I guess I should just check what my hardware supports and find a way to make use of that. I got a lenovo thinkpad x230 from 2012, with old i5 and integrated intel graphics, so whatever my device has I guess there is a reasonable chance it's wide spread
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:21:59] pyzozord; Too bad it can't run Windows 11.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:23:10] This may be the first time in a long time that I finally have copies of two versions of Windows in a row.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:23:25] I went from 3.1 to 98 to XP to 7 to 10.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:23:30] vdamewood: it can't? I think I ran windows 11 two weeks ago for a moment to check some driver issues on linux. But not sure if that was windows 11 or 10
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:24:00] pyzozord: Did you sign up for the Insiders' program, and download a beta?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:24:15] oh than no, I download whatever was publically available
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:24:23] 10
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:24:49] This reminds me that I still don't have an ISO of win 10 to run as a VM.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:24:58] sorry, I lost track of windowses. Yeah I gues it was 10. It was looking pretty fancy so I thought it was the newest
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:25:20] on my todo list to get one of those :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:25:30] mrig: Visit this link in a non-Windows OS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:25:53] (If you use Windows, that page will redirect you to the media creation tool.)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:26:12] pyzozord: It is. 11 is still beta.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:26:27] 11 Won't be released until later this year.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:26:45] the page wont open :(
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:27:01] mrig: OS and browser?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:27:31] the browser, seems that all of my add blockers and malicious script blockers have been set off.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	vdamewood	[10:28:00] Yeah, I can't really help with that.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:29:25] just had to go through and slowly allow things until it works, a bit of a pain in the ass.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:30:44] cool, I've got one downloading.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:31:08] not sure if I'll be able to get my licence number and use that or not though.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:31:25] It would be cool to figure out video. I'd love to make games with that technology that Blade Runner had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkwpa5YPhx8
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:31:44] must be a way to do that on a vm, if you've got an original install image.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[10:32:07] It had like video backgrounds but those clips had also depth and lighting information, so it integrated fantastically with the characters
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:33:56] oh cool; I'd no idea that the game existed!

2021-07-17 23:54:17	Intelo	[10:36:43] having one Entity table with type=person, animal, metal, plastic      or   have 4 tables  separately named person, animal, metal, plastic?   The pros/cons I see in first strategy is that if I need to add address, I can just add one address table mapping to enttiy but con is there one additional `where` clause needed to fine type.  while in second
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Intelo	[10:36:44] strategy, no need for that. but in second, I have to make 4 address tables also. Any views?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	furrymcgee	[10:39:31] probably five tables/relations
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[10:39:34] that's a bit like asking what's better, a big bucket of water of 4 small buckets of water
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[10:39:46] which is better depends on context i'd say
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[10:40:11] are you going to be accessing all data on each query, or just one type of data
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[10:46:53] That must have been so satisfying to have worked on at the time, the bladerunner game.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Intelo	[10:50:34] pulse just one type
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:04:17] wow, I can't believe how much juice it takes to simply read a page on medium.com sites.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:04:43] I wonder if some script is being blocked and that is putting it into some perpetual loop.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:05:11] If not that, they must be crypto mining on my resources :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:06:27] mrig: This is why I'm very interested in Gemini. :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:06:59] yes does make it all the more appealing.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:07:31] this site is running one of my processors at almost 100% all of the time, does anyone else have the same experience?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:08:08] nothing on my system in my day to day use requires this much processing power :|
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:08:33] Youtube puts a load on my machine
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-17 23:54:17	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-17 23:54:17	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-17 23:54:17	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-17 23:54:17	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Intelo	[11:29:18] pulse This https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit?usp=sharing
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:29:24] h0gan: that's a good place to be in imo
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:29:37] h0gan: I'll need to learn read an MBA book myself
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:29:43] wow, this medium.com site does not even scroll correctly.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-17 23:54:17	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-17 23:54:17	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-17 23:54:17	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-17 23:54:17	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-17 23:54:17	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.

2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-17 23:54:17	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-17 23:54:17	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-17 23:54:17	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.

2021-07-17 23:54:17	Mangy_Dog	[15:56:20] https://imgur.com/a/YzOetBF because of the size of the graphic asset i think. Its causing some kind of over load somewhere in the image buffer... So i had to cut back a bit on the fading scan effect making it corser

2021-07-17 23:58:54	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:04:49] main
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-17 23:58:54	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	 *	pyzozord [09:06:13] types "man mrig"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:06:19] Who said it was being coverned by a dictator?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:06:58] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept. <- whos dictum?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[09:30:44] Percussionist who is also deaf
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:30:53] So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:31:04] Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:31:15] immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:31:24] ?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:31:50] And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:32:32] vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:32:46] arahael: She has been deaf since birth and was initially rejected by the academy of music on this premise, She then proceeded to point out to the board members what was wrong with their musical notation system and how it failed to annotate the majority of the nuances that she could perceive.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:32:52] In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:32:57] arahael: I don't follow your logic?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:33:08] a xylophonist yes, highly skilled deaf musician.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:33:19] pyzozord: To be honest, i thought the original comment was just meant to be a pun.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:33:24] vdamewood: Ah, I thought it might sound almost the same.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:33:26] she made the academy panel look dumb, and rather deaf.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:33:43] Also, for what it's worth the word manual comes from the latun word for 'hand'.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:33:44] pyzozord: yes of course it does :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:33:47] as in handbook.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:34:02] same root as main or hand on deck.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:34:07] to be counted.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:34:22] arahael: Nope. they sound considerably different.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:34:27] vdamewood: Ah, nevermind then!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:34:41] arahael: You know the difference between the k and w sounds, right?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[09:34:56] vdamewood: Yes, there's a *very slight* difference. ;)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:34:56] arahael: that is very much only hypothesis.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:35:12] most of linguists is.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:35:28] this is why I love etymology, it adds science to linguistics.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:36:07] arahael: With that winky I can't tell if your joking or not.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:36:09] arguably, wo relates also to both wood and Chinese wu
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:36:35] and there is a reason to link them, in the cultural science and beliefs of the time.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[09:36:37] looking up where words came from is fun :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:36:38] Wu means nothing to me.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:37:24] wu is to be a leader, you could liken that to wo of wode, and to the matriarchal culture that existed when the word woman may have been coined.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:38:52] of course to a roman, that would be very different, and perceived in a very different light, the Romans were not fans of Boadicea.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:38:59] wo betide them!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[09:40:27] "Romanes Eunt Domus EXPLAINED | Monty Python's Life of Brian • Fun with Latin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfH6gjxTTgE
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:41:51] :D Not sure that this latin would have existed at that time though, it was developed far later, would have been vulgar (no offence to the vulgar people) at that time. :P
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:43:09] such vulgar people <- Very non PC!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:43:23] PC <- Oxymoron.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:43:51] mrig: linguists describe, not prescribe, except when language is doing something really dumb and even then their idea still has to spread organically
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:44:09] immibis: not when studied as vedanga.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[09:44:32] you get to control the english language because of ... religious bullshit?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:44:48] immibis: religion has nothing to do with this.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:45:03] this is the grammar of pannini
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:46:00] to bring ones own beliefs into a discussion of a foreign culture is not wise.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:46:11] mrig: Sorry, that was meant as a pun. The character 無 is pronounced wú and means nothing.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:46:13] colours or taints the understanding.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:46:38] vdamewood: I thought that it was an ancient dialect.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:46:49] To old old hat.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:46:59] ops, to old hat perhaps.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:47:12] Well, that's modern Mandarin.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:47:12] Too <- silly lugwedge.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:47:28] ah modern linguistic entropy included.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:48:08] immibis: I am not interested by control in the slightest, are you?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[09:48:44] language is a beautiful ergonomic natural thing, I find it fascinating.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[09:54:08] Well, yay. I scratched myself on a screw in my bookshelf that's sticking up.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:04:03] I want to put gif/webp/mp4 animation in the background of my terminal, is ffmpeg the best way to do it? It seem so heavy and complex. Also I want to make the animation be mostly handled by the gpu to keep the cpu usage low
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:04:46] pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:05:30] arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[10:05:46] I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:06:07] I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:06:36] vdamewood: I checked I did see some "animated gif" in the ffmpeg docs, but I'm not sure that meant actual support
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:06:42] you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:07:03] pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:07:40] pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:07:46] ANd yes, mp4 is a container format.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:08:24] arahael: Well, I also meant to contrast it with a situation like Ogg, where pretty much overy Ogg video is Theora.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:08:41] Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:08:51] GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:08:59] Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[10:09:43] pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:09:59] pyzozord: I seem to recall that some SoC's do have hardware routines for video processing.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:10:10] To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:10:32] pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:10:41] GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:10:55] arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:11:01] h.264
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:11:03] arahael: nice thanks!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:11:05] vdamewood: Probably.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[10:11:21] Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:11:28] pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:11:39] pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:11:40] arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[10:11:51] We already have H265 and they're working on H266
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:11:52] It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:12:15] GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:12:17] vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:12:31] I think decoding gifs in GPU shaders is a good idea, I doubt there is any dedicated hardware to gifs :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[10:13:01] it might not be possible. The LZW compression used by GIF is inherently sequential
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:13:22] According to https://larryjordan.com/articles/apple-adds-hardware-to-improve-video-compression-speeds/ the M1 can do  H.264, 8-bit HEVC, and 10-bit HEVC using hardware encoding in hardware.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[10:13:26] (you can have sequential dedicated hardware that may be faster than a CPU, but you can't parallelize it by running it on a GPU)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:14:27] immibis: thanks, that's valuable comment
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:14:45] pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:15:39] Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:15:54] hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[10:15:57] Depends how they;'re defining a core
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[10:16:35] The easiest way would be to use an atlas of the frames and just switch between them
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:16:38] pyzozord: (j/k) Solid black?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:17:04] vdamewood: doing 0.8 alpha black now :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[10:17:27] pyzozord: least amount of energy? don't animate your terminal backgrounds
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:17:32] Does RAM use moe energy if you store more in it, or is it using 100% power consumption no matter what's loaded?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:17:42] immibis: *with the fancy animated background
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:18:43] vdamewood: I'm not sure but I think ram needs refreshing to not corrupt
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:19:15] vdamewood: but there could be some clever algorithms keeping track of which banks have any data stored, and banks that have no data stored don't get refreshed
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:19:33] So, I guess the question becomes, does that happen?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:19:53] And I left ##hardware in the migration.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:20:09] vdamewood: They moved here, too.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[10:20:31] vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[10:20:40] the big IRC migration of 2021, i will tell my grandsons about it
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:20:56] pulse: You will have grandsons?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[10:21:01] assuming i ever have grandsons
2021-07-17 23:58:54	immibis	[10:21:02] i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:21:32] Hmm this gives me some ideas. I guess I should just check what my hardware supports and find a way to make use of that. I got a lenovo thinkpad x230 from 2012, with old i5 and integrated intel graphics, so whatever my device has I guess there is a reasonable chance it's wide spread
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:21:59] pyzozord; Too bad it can't run Windows 11.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:23:10] This may be the first time in a long time that I finally have copies of two versions of Windows in a row.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:23:25] I went from 3.1 to 98 to XP to 7 to 10.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:23:30] vdamewood: it can't? I think I ran windows 11 two weeks ago for a moment to check some driver issues on linux. But not sure if that was windows 11 or 10
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:24:00] pyzozord: Did you sign up for the Insiders' program, and download a beta?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:24:15] oh than no, I download whatever was publically available
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:24:23] 10
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:24:49] This reminds me that I still don't have an ISO of win 10 to run as a VM.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:24:58] sorry, I lost track of windowses. Yeah I gues it was 10. It was looking pretty fancy so I thought it was the newest
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:25:20] on my todo list to get one of those :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:25:30] mrig: Visit this link in a non-Windows OS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:25:53] (If you use Windows, that page will redirect you to the media creation tool.)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:26:12] pyzozord: It is. 11 is still beta.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:26:27] 11 Won't be released until later this year.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:26:45] the page wont open :(
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:27:01] mrig: OS and browser?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:27:31] the browser, seems that all of my add blockers and malicious script blockers have been set off.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	vdamewood	[10:28:00] Yeah, I can't really help with that.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:29:25] just had to go through and slowly allow things until it works, a bit of a pain in the ass.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:30:44] cool, I've got one downloading.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:31:08] not sure if I'll be able to get my licence number and use that or not though.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:31:25] It would be cool to figure out video. I'd love to make games with that technology that Blade Runner had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkwpa5YPhx8
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:31:44] must be a way to do that on a vm, if you've got an original install image.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:32:07] It had like video backgrounds but those clips had also depth and lighting information, so it integrated fantastically with the characters
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:33:56] oh cool; I'd no idea that the game existed!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[10:35:07] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goovFvN1hns
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[10:35:15] [Every Old School Computer Game]
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[10:36:09] pulse: heheh :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Intelo	[10:36:43] having one Entity table with type=person, animal, metal, plastic      or   have 4 tables  separately named person, animal, metal, plastic?   The pros/cons I see in first strategy is that if I need to add address, I can just add one address table mapping to enttiy but con is there one additional `where` clause needed to fine type.  while in second
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Intelo	[10:36:44] strategy, no need for that. but in second, I have to make 4 address tables also. Any views?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	furrymcgee	[10:39:31] probably five tables/relations
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[10:39:34] that's a bit like asking what's better, a big bucket of water of 4 small buckets of water
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[10:39:46] which is better depends on context i'd say
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[10:40:11] are you going to be accessing all data on each query, or just one type of data
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[10:46:53] That must have been so satisfying to have worked on at the time, the bladerunner game.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Intelo	[10:50:34] pulse just one type
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:04:17] wow, I can't believe how much juice it takes to simply read a page on medium.com sites.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:04:43] I wonder if some script is being blocked and that is putting it into some perpetual loop.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:05:11] If not that, they must be crypto mining on my resources :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:06:27] mrig: This is why I'm very interested in Gemini. :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:06:59] yes does make it all the more appealing.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:07:31] this site is running one of my processors at almost 100% all of the time, does anyone else have the same experience?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:08:08] nothing on my system in my day to day use requires this much processing power :|
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:08:33] Youtube puts a load on my machine
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-17 23:58:54	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-17 23:58:54	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-17 23:58:54	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-17 23:58:54	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Intelo	[11:29:18] pulse This https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit?usp=sharing
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:29:24] h0gan: that's a good place to be in imo
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:29:37] h0gan: I'll need to learn read an MBA book myself
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:29:43] wow, this medium.com site does not even scroll correctly.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-17 23:58:54	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-17 23:58:54	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-17 23:58:54	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-17 23:58:54	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rannnn8888	[15:15:46] someone know how use the pack googletrans with proxy ? pythn

2021-07-17 23:58:54	freshgumbubbles4	[15:51:29] Go check up with the operators of the respective proxies
2021-07-17 23:58:54	Mangy_Dog	[15:56:20] https://imgur.com/a/YzOetBF because of the size of the graphic asset i think. Its causing some kind of over load somewhere in the image buffer... So i had to cut back a bit on the fading scan effect making it corser
2021-07-17 23:58:54	meleoron	[17:29:49] is there an easy way to get the oldest releases of popular C programs like GCC or GNU Emacs?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	edgar-rft	[17:34:29] I think wikipedia can tell you that
2021-07-17 23:58:54	yitz	[17:40:48] Grab the first commit in the repo?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	novns	[17:42:02] meleoron, look at USENET comp.sources.*
2021-07-17 23:58:54	novns	[17:42:17] where things were posted those days
2021-07-17 23:58:54	mrig	[17:42:54] This could be a good place to look too https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/old-releases/
2021-07-17 23:58:54	meleoron	[17:46:30] mrig: that worked. thanks!
2021-07-17 23:58:54	rannnn8888	[17:54:23] help what him want from me ?https://dpaste.org/8vxw
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[17:55:50] Link doesn't work
2021-07-17 23:58:54	beaky	[18:19:08] hello why are types called types when its the same word as typing on a keyboard or types in typesetting
2021-07-17 23:58:54	AlexDelarge	[18:20:05] wow.  just...wow
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[18:23:37] because english uses 1 word to mean at least 10 things
2021-07-17 23:58:54	GeDaMo	[18:24:19] Isn't 'set' the English word with the most meanings?
2021-07-17 23:58:54	pulse	[18:24:37] yes, it's most unsettling
2021-07-17 23:58:54	beaky	[18:24:52] i thought throughout history in english type has always meant like typing letters but then one day someone came up with types for the things that come with values and variables

2021-07-18 00:01:22	teut	[08:46:45] so it's help only here
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[08:47:06] help is just for builtin bash commands
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[08:47:39] it's much less useful then man in general
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[08:58:05] Trashlord: why would you require a special page for only one gender? man refers to both, it is a common reflection of the general stupidity and ignorance of that academic class to presume man to mean only male.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[08:58:48] curious state of affairs, and a fascinating linguistic effect.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[08:59:10] somewhat akin to reflection in a programming language.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:00:32] presumption does however lead rational in times of utter confusion.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:00:49] another way of saying that it is a sign of the times I suppose.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:01:31] man pages are awesome.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:04:12] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:04:49] main
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:05:12] that is hand in French, a hand.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:05:16] a grunt basicaly
2021-07-18 00:01:22	teut	[09:05:24] too bad for bookwriters vdamewood
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:05:29] vdamewood: language does not work like that.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:05:43] mrig: Like what?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:05:45] Sound is more complicated.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:06:03] vdamewood: to be governed by any one dictator.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	 *	pyzozord [09:06:13] types "man mrig"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:06:19] Who said it was being coverned by a dictator?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:06:20] sadly no results :(
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:06:32] vdamewood: you gave me a dictate.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:06:40] to I responded to it.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:06:47] I was relaying information from multiple resources.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	 *	pyzozord [09:06:57] types "sudo apt install mrig-doc"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:06:58] mrig: The usage of 'man' to refer to all genders is a now-outdated concept. <- whos dictum?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:07:18] pyzozord: my docs are universal.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:07:20] mrig: The idea that I'm 'dictating' applies as much to me as it does to you.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:07:42] vdamewood: it is not about you.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:07:55] mrig: No it isn't. I don't see why you're making it that way.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:08:12] I am simply choosing words that seem apt when discussing matters of diction.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:08:33] hah! I see what you did there mrig!
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:08:40] man pertaining to human, is not out of date from my perspective.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:08:45] Well, to many, the usage of 'man' to refer to men and women is considered an out-dated, sexist usage.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:08:48] man pertaining to human is indeed archaic
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:08:56] not necessarily sexist, but certainly archaic
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:09:08] (can also be sexist depending on context)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:09:10] ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:09:19] And also note, "man" in the context of the previous conversation had nothing to do with gender.  It's a shortening of "manual".
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:09:39] <mrig> ignorance is the current trend, but that is a temporary state of affairs. <- You can contribute by updating your own ignorance
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:09:45] I feel like "man" referring to "humanity" is still alive in written word, less so in speach
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:09:55] speech
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:09:57] pyzozord: Indeed, I still use it in that sense.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:09:59] arahael is also correct that man pages have nothing to do with gender
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:10:22] pyzozord: Mainly when dealing with eg, the Bible, however, which was written thousands of years ago. :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[09:11:06] The Bible has also been through multiple edits and translations
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:11:44] immibis: I try to be always learning, so if my understanding, treads upon yours.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:11:52] no offence intended.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:12:28] mrig: The Oxford style manual says to prefer otehr gender-neutral terms rather than 'man' and 'mankind'.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:12:33] pyzozord: It absolutely is, and man being from the French 'main' is also very relevant; That is man rather than gentry.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:12:34] the fact is that "man = human" is obsolete usage. Nowadays we use "human"
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:12:52] vdamewood: academia is in one hell of a shambles :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	 *	mrig [09:13:07] chuckles at the absurdity of it all.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:13:16] not the first time though.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:13:35] in the past "mankind" may have been considered gender-neutral, but now we have better words which are gender-neutral and that one has fallen out of favour as gender-neutral
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:13:54] GeDaMo: Yeah, lets leave it at that, a thorough discussion of the bible would derail the conversation. :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:14:00] Trying to think of a modern text that uses "man" but I can't think of any. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was used in some research papers from like Chomsky
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:14:04] immibis: that may be your dictate, it is not mine; Woman, is an augmentation of man that sets women above all man.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[09:30:44] Percussionist who is also deaf
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:30:53] So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:31:04] Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:31:15] immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:31:24] ?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:31:50] And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:32:32] vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:32:46] arahael: She has been deaf since birth and was initially rejected by the academy of music on this premise, She then proceeded to point out to the board members what was wrong with their musical notation system and how it failed to annotate the majority of the nuances that she could perceive.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:32:52] In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:32:57] arahael: I don't follow your logic?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:33:08] a xylophonist yes, highly skilled deaf musician.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:33:19] pyzozord: To be honest, i thought the original comment was just meant to be a pun.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:33:24] vdamewood: Ah, I thought it might sound almost the same.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:33:26] she made the academy panel look dumb, and rather deaf.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:33:43] Also, for what it's worth the word manual comes from the latun word for 'hand'.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:33:44] pyzozord: yes of course it does :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:33:47] as in handbook.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:34:02] same root as main or hand on deck.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:34:07] to be counted.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:34:22] arahael: Nope. they sound considerably different.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:34:27] vdamewood: Ah, nevermind then!
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:34:41] arahael: You know the difference between the k and w sounds, right?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[09:34:56] vdamewood: Yes, there's a *very slight* difference. ;)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:34:56] arahael: that is very much only hypothesis.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:35:12] most of linguists is.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:35:28] this is why I love etymology, it adds science to linguistics.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:36:07] arahael: With that winky I can't tell if your joking or not.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:36:09] arguably, wo relates also to both wood and Chinese wu
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:36:35] and there is a reason to link them, in the cultural science and beliefs of the time.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[09:36:37] looking up where words came from is fun :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:36:38] Wu means nothing to me.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:37:24] wu is to be a leader, you could liken that to wo of wode, and to the matriarchal culture that existed when the word woman may have been coined.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:38:52] of course to a roman, that would be very different, and perceived in a very different light, the Romans were not fans of Boadicea.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:38:59] wo betide them!
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[09:40:27] "Romanes Eunt Domus EXPLAINED | Monty Python's Life of Brian • Fun with Latin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfH6gjxTTgE
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:41:51] :D Not sure that this latin would have existed at that time though, it was developed far later, would have been vulgar (no offence to the vulgar people) at that time. :P
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:43:09] such vulgar people <- Very non PC!
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:43:23] PC <- Oxymoron.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:43:51] mrig: linguists describe, not prescribe, except when language is doing something really dumb and even then their idea still has to spread organically
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:44:09] immibis: not when studied as vedanga.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[09:44:32] you get to control the english language because of ... religious bullshit?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:44:48] immibis: religion has nothing to do with this.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:45:03] this is the grammar of pannini
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:46:00] to bring ones own beliefs into a discussion of a foreign culture is not wise.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:46:11] mrig: Sorry, that was meant as a pun. The character 無 is pronounced wú and means nothing.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:46:13] colours or taints the understanding.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:46:38] vdamewood: I thought that it was an ancient dialect.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:46:49] To old old hat.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:46:59] ops, to old hat perhaps.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:47:12] Well, that's modern Mandarin.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:47:12] Too <- silly lugwedge.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:47:28] ah modern linguistic entropy included.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:48:08] immibis: I am not interested by control in the slightest, are you?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[09:48:44] language is a beautiful ergonomic natural thing, I find it fascinating.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[09:54:08] Well, yay. I scratched myself on a screw in my bookshelf that's sticking up.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:04:03] I want to put gif/webp/mp4 animation in the background of my terminal, is ffmpeg the best way to do it? It seem so heavy and complex. Also I want to make the animation be mostly handled by the gpu to keep the cpu usage low
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:04:46] pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:05:30] arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[10:05:46] I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:06:07] I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:06:36] vdamewood: I checked I did see some "animated gif" in the ffmpeg docs, but I'm not sure that meant actual support
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:06:42] you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:07:03] pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:07:40] pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:07:46] ANd yes, mp4 is a container format.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:08:24] arahael: Well, I also meant to contrast it with a situation like Ogg, where pretty much overy Ogg video is Theora.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:08:41] Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:08:51] GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:08:59] Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[10:09:43] pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:09:59] pyzozord: I seem to recall that some SoC's do have hardware routines for video processing.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:10:10] To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:10:32] pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:10:41] GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:10:55] arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:11:01] h.264
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:11:03] arahael: nice thanks!
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:11:05] vdamewood: Probably.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[10:11:21] Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:11:28] pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:11:39] pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:11:40] arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[10:11:51] We already have H265 and they're working on H266
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:11:52] It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:12:15] GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:12:17] vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:12:31] I think decoding gifs in GPU shaders is a good idea, I doubt there is any dedicated hardware to gifs :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[10:13:01] it might not be possible. The LZW compression used by GIF is inherently sequential
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:13:22] According to https://larryjordan.com/articles/apple-adds-hardware-to-improve-video-compression-speeds/ the M1 can do  H.264, 8-bit HEVC, and 10-bit HEVC using hardware encoding in hardware.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[10:13:26] (you can have sequential dedicated hardware that may be faster than a CPU, but you can't parallelize it by running it on a GPU)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:14:27] immibis: thanks, that's valuable comment
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:14:45] pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:15:39] Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:15:54] hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[10:15:57] Depends how they;'re defining a core
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[10:16:35] The easiest way would be to use an atlas of the frames and just switch between them
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:16:38] pyzozord: (j/k) Solid black?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:17:04] vdamewood: doing 0.8 alpha black now :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[10:17:27] pyzozord: least amount of energy? don't animate your terminal backgrounds
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:17:32] Does RAM use moe energy if you store more in it, or is it using 100% power consumption no matter what's loaded?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:17:42] immibis: *with the fancy animated background
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:18:43] vdamewood: I'm not sure but I think ram needs refreshing to not corrupt
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:19:15] vdamewood: but there could be some clever algorithms keeping track of which banks have any data stored, and banks that have no data stored don't get refreshed
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:19:33] So, I guess the question becomes, does that happen?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:19:53] And I left ##hardware in the migration.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:20:09] vdamewood: They moved here, too.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[10:20:31] vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[10:20:40] the big IRC migration of 2021, i will tell my grandsons about it
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:20:56] pulse: You will have grandsons?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[10:21:01] assuming i ever have grandsons
2021-07-18 00:01:22	immibis	[10:21:02] i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:21:32] Hmm this gives me some ideas. I guess I should just check what my hardware supports and find a way to make use of that. I got a lenovo thinkpad x230 from 2012, with old i5 and integrated intel graphics, so whatever my device has I guess there is a reasonable chance it's wide spread
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:21:59] pyzozord; Too bad it can't run Windows 11.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:23:10] This may be the first time in a long time that I finally have copies of two versions of Windows in a row.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:23:25] I went from 3.1 to 98 to XP to 7 to 10.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:23:30] vdamewood: it can't? I think I ran windows 11 two weeks ago for a moment to check some driver issues on linux. But not sure if that was windows 11 or 10
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:24:00] pyzozord: Did you sign up for the Insiders' program, and download a beta?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:24:15] oh than no, I download whatever was publically available
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:24:23] 10
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:24:49] This reminds me that I still don't have an ISO of win 10 to run as a VM.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:24:58] sorry, I lost track of windowses. Yeah I gues it was 10. It was looking pretty fancy so I thought it was the newest
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:25:20] on my todo list to get one of those :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:25:30] mrig: Visit this link in a non-Windows OS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:25:53] (If you use Windows, that page will redirect you to the media creation tool.)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:26:12] pyzozord: It is. 11 is still beta.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:26:27] 11 Won't be released until later this year.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:26:45] the page wont open :(
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:27:01] mrig: OS and browser?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:27:31] the browser, seems that all of my add blockers and malicious script blockers have been set off.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	vdamewood	[10:28:00] Yeah, I can't really help with that.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:29:25] just had to go through and slowly allow things until it works, a bit of a pain in the ass.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:30:44] cool, I've got one downloading.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:31:08] not sure if I'll be able to get my licence number and use that or not though.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:31:25] It would be cool to figure out video. I'd love to make games with that technology that Blade Runner had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkwpa5YPhx8
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:31:44] must be a way to do that on a vm, if you've got an original install image.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[10:32:07] It had like video backgrounds but those clips had also depth and lighting information, so it integrated fantastically with the characters
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:33:56] oh cool; I'd no idea that the game existed!

2021-07-18 00:01:22	Intelo	[10:36:43] having one Entity table with type=person, animal, metal, plastic      or   have 4 tables  separately named person, animal, metal, plastic?   The pros/cons I see in first strategy is that if I need to add address, I can just add one address table mapping to enttiy but con is there one additional `where` clause needed to fine type.  while in second
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Intelo	[10:36:44] strategy, no need for that. but in second, I have to make 4 address tables also. Any views?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	furrymcgee	[10:39:31] probably five tables/relations
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[10:39:34] that's a bit like asking what's better, a big bucket of water of 4 small buckets of water
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[10:39:46] which is better depends on context i'd say
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[10:40:11] are you going to be accessing all data on each query, or just one type of data
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[10:46:53] That must have been so satisfying to have worked on at the time, the bladerunner game.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Intelo	[10:50:34] pulse just one type
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:04:17] wow, I can't believe how much juice it takes to simply read a page on medium.com sites.

2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-18 00:01:22	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-18 00:01:22	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-18 00:01:22	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-18 00:01:22	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Intelo	[11:29:18] pulse This https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit?usp=sharing
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:29:24] h0gan: that's a good place to be in imo
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:29:37] h0gan: I'll need to learn read an MBA book myself
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:29:43] wow, this medium.com site does not even scroll correctly.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-18 00:01:22	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-18 00:01:22	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-18 00:01:22	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-18 00:01:22	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-18 00:01:22	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-18 00:01:22	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.

2021-07-18 00:01:22	beaky	[18:19:08] hello why are types called types when its the same word as typing on a keyboard or types in typesetting
2021-07-18 00:01:22	AlexDelarge	[18:20:05] wow.  just...wow
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[18:23:37] because english uses 1 word to mean at least 10 things
2021-07-18 00:01:22	GeDaMo	[18:24:19] Isn't 'set' the English word with the most meanings?
2021-07-18 00:01:22	pulse	[18:24:37] yes, it's most unsettling
2021-07-18 00:01:22	beaky	[18:24:52] i thought throughout history in english type has always meant like typing letters but then one day someone came up with types for the things that come with values and variables

2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:14:12] mrig: sounds like sexism
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:14:25] though women are men, they are set above them.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:14:36] immibis: that is your projection not my disposition.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:14:48] mrig: you literally just said woman is an augmentation of man
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:14:55] and women are above all men
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:14:55] universal man, has a very specific meaning to me.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[09:15:13] http://www.roaringbitmap.org/about/
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:15:20] immibis: that is what the prefix wo means, in my opinion, linguistically.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:15:27] mrig: it's not a prefix
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:15:33] its a nod towards woden.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:15:39] and the creation of life.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:15:53] it's just two words that happen to be similar. Happens all the time in language. Is hamster and augmentation of ham?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:15:56] an*
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:16:16] Why women tend to go first into life boats and when sacking a culture women are most often preserved.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:16:17] immibis: I want to reply, but an uprising would quell against me!
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:16:28] immibis: nonsense
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:17:24] immibis: you should investigate some older language, English is too new and bastardized to get any notion of what etymology is nor how it plays a part in the emergent nature of grammar.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:17:46] mrig: Regardless, I would agree with teh consensus here that the language is still sexist.  And would suggest you avoid it unless you're in a context where it makes sense to use them, eg, perhaps you're discussing some specific philosophy where it matters or some specific cultural or theological concept.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:17:54] if you believe grammar is emergent then you shouldn't follow your own made-up rules like "wo" being a prefix
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:18:28] why not say that "wo" comes from the german word meaning "where" and therefore "woman" means "where man?" which means a woman should always have a man which means women are lesser than men
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:18:35] that's an equally valid made-up silly rule
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[09:18:53] GeDaMo: what is this useful for? Is it like alternative to jpeg?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:19:24] pyzozord: I just had a glance at the page, however, I think 'bitmap' used there is not related to graphics.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[09:20:08] oh so general purpose in-memory binary blob compression?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[09:20:32] Not, it's for sets
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[09:20:33] Ah! RTFM pyzozord... "Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps."
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:20:40] arahael: I avoid it due to the walking upon eggshells effect and for no other reason, it is not sexist to use a word and to insisst upon its etymologically correct origin.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:21:26] I am not being sexist I am expressing a deeply considered linguistic perspective, to which I have offered also reasoning.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[09:21:54] pyzozord: e.g. databases combining 'where' clauses with 'and' / 'or'
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:22:10] mrig: As the population often referred to "deaf and dumb", I would say words betray the motivations of the people using them; Eg, whilst I would ask people not to call me "deaf and dumb", I would prefer you to avoid sexist langauge where it's appropriate.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:22:31] mrig: I am part of the population often referred to as "deaf and dumb", I would say.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:23:25] immibis: sure, most European grammar is pretty basic, man however does have roots that go back further, to manu mani mana for example.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:24:08] mrig: Just because a word has roots that go back far, doesn't change the fact that its usage may be offensive to some.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[09:24:32] arahael: I have never heard anyone say anything like that, and if they say it, I'd think they are the dumb ones
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:24:41] pyzozord: It's archaic. :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:24:43] mrig: are there any other words whose etymologically correct origins you insist upon, which are not widely accepted?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:24:55] arahael: I will avoid it due to the eggshells and prevalent cultural narcissism, but will reiterate that it is not sexist to use man, so I shall apply manas here and drop the subject.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:25:42] immibis: I reject my mother tongue as ridiculous, so can offer quite a few.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:26:09] A curios linguistic phenomenon.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:26:15] but very human.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:26:21] pyzozord: "deaf and dumb" used to refer to an individual who was deaf and couldn't speak, this was at a time where "learning is by hearing", so you had all that built into that description.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:26:47] pyzozord: Ie, if you're deaf, you can't be taught.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:27:28] what do we call people who are capable of hearing, but refuse to accept information anyway?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:27:39] immibis: English is far to ambiguous for my use, causes me far to much trouble in cognition dues to this; And this is a priamarly example of how.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:27:43] immibis: The bible would call such people deaf! :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[09:27:43] arahael: I see, yeah that one did not age well
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:27:45] And for what it's worth, dumb originally was a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:27:48] immibis: aphasic
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:28:39] pyzozord: It aged sadly well. :( In my country, the local sign language was only recognised, formally, in about 1987.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:29:10] arahael: To be honest, your country sucks, almost as much as mine, when it comes to minority rights.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:29:21] vdamewood: Definitely won't argue that point.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:30:05] vdamewood: Indeed, was also a synonym for 'mute'.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:30:07] arahael: Are you familiar with Evelyn Glennie?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:30:12] She is just superb.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:30:28] mrig: Not at all.  She bangs on stuff and makes noise?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[09:30:44] Percussionist who is also deaf
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:30:53] So, I just looked up the etymology of 'human'. Looks like it doesn't come from the same root as 'man' and 'woman'.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:31:04] Which I found kind of interesting.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:31:15] immibis: are there any other supposition as to the prevalence of your superior perspective that you wish to imply or infer?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:31:24] ?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:31:50] And looks like the 'wo' in woman was originally wīf, which is wife in modern English.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:32:32] vdamewood: It suddenly strikes me that...  Is that why that character in Futurama is called "Kif"?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:32:46] arahael: She has been deaf since birth and was initially rejected by the academy of music on this premise, She then proceeded to point out to the board members what was wrong with their musical notation system and how it failed to annotate the majority of the nuances that she could perceive.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[09:32:52] In any case "man" comes from manual, same way "grep" comes from g/re/p
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:32:57] arahael: I don't follow your logic?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:33:08] a xylophonist yes, highly skilled deaf musician.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:33:19] pyzozord: To be honest, i thought the original comment was just meant to be a pun.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:33:24] vdamewood: Ah, I thought it might sound almost the same.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:33:26] she made the academy panel look dumb, and rather deaf.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:33:43] Also, for what it's worth the word manual comes from the latun word for 'hand'.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:33:44] pyzozord: yes of course it does :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:33:47] as in handbook.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:34:02] same root as main or hand on deck.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:34:07] to be counted.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:34:22] arahael: Nope. they sound considerably different.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:34:27] vdamewood: Ah, nevermind then!
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:34:41] arahael: You know the difference between the k and w sounds, right?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[09:34:56] vdamewood: Yes, there's a *very slight* difference. ;)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:34:56] arahael: that is very much only hypothesis.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:35:12] most of linguists is.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:35:28] this is why I love etymology, it adds science to linguistics.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:36:07] arahael: With that winky I can't tell if your joking or not.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:36:09] arguably, wo relates also to both wood and Chinese wu
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:36:35] and there is a reason to link them, in the cultural science and beliefs of the time.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[09:36:37] looking up where words came from is fun :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:36:38] Wu means nothing to me.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:37:24] wu is to be a leader, you could liken that to wo of wode, and to the matriarchal culture that existed when the word woman may have been coined.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:38:52] of course to a roman, that would be very different, and perceived in a very different light, the Romans were not fans of Boadicea.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:38:59] wo betide them!
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[09:40:27] "Romanes Eunt Domus EXPLAINED | Monty Python's Life of Brian • Fun with Latin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfH6gjxTTgE
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:41:51] :D Not sure that this latin would have existed at that time though, it was developed far later, would have been vulgar (no offence to the vulgar people) at that time. :P
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:43:09] such vulgar people <- Very non PC!
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:43:23] PC <- Oxymoron.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:43:51] mrig: linguists describe, not prescribe, except when language is doing something really dumb and even then their idea still has to spread organically
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:44:09] immibis: not when studied as vedanga.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[09:44:32] you get to control the english language because of ... religious bullshit?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:44:48] immibis: religion has nothing to do with this.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:45:03] this is the grammar of pannini
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:46:00] to bring ones own beliefs into a discussion of a foreign culture is not wise.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:46:11] mrig: Sorry, that was meant as a pun. The character 無 is pronounced wú and means nothing.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:46:13] colours or taints the understanding.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:46:38] vdamewood: I thought that it was an ancient dialect.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:46:49] To old old hat.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:46:59] ops, to old hat perhaps.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:47:12] Well, that's modern Mandarin.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:47:12] Too <- silly lugwedge.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:47:28] ah modern linguistic entropy included.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:48:08] immibis: I am not interested by control in the slightest, are you?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[09:48:44] language is a beautiful ergonomic natural thing, I find it fascinating.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[09:54:08] Well, yay. I scratched myself on a screw in my bookshelf that's sticking up.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:04:03] I want to put gif/webp/mp4 animation in the background of my terminal, is ffmpeg the best way to do it? It seem so heavy and complex. Also I want to make the animation be mostly handled by the gpu to keep the cpu usage low
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:04:46] pyzozord: All I know is that you'll want to avoid actual transcoding.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:05:30] arahael: can you elaborate, I'm not 100% sure I understand
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[10:05:46] I don't know if you can decode mp4 in a shader
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:06:07] I don't think ffmpeg handles gif and webp
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:06:36] vdamewood: I checked I did see some "animated gif" in the ffmpeg docs, but I'm not sure that meant actual support
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:06:42] you could load all the frames of the gif into memory I suppose?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:07:03] pyzozord: It might be worth noting, that, (I think) there are multiple video codecs supported by and associted with mp4 containers.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:07:40] pyzozord: You basically don't want to do video *conversions*, beyond simple stretching/warping which can be done in hardware.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:07:46] ANd yes, mp4 is a container format.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:08:24] arahael: Well, I also meant to contrast it with a situation like Ogg, where pretty much overy Ogg video is Theora.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:08:41] Ah, fair enough. You know way more than I do here. :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:08:51] GeDaMo: I'm thinking that there must be some hardware either cpu or gpu facilities for video... SIMD comes to mind, but there could be something more specific for video. All I want is to avoid decoding gifs/video in the normal C code (so avoid running on ALU?)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:08:59] Ogg audio on the other hand can be Vorbis, Speax, or FLAC.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[10:09:43] pyzozord: if you want it done on the GPU, that means shaders which are programs that run on the GPU
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:09:59] pyzozord: I seem to recall that some SoC's do have hardware routines for video processing.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:10:10] To be fair, Windows Terminal does all of its rendering in the GPU.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:10:32] pyzozord: Eg, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037112/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:10:41] GeDaMo: yeah, i'm vaguely familiar with shaders. So GPUS are just shader executors? I was thinking that maybe there are video specific facilities that are not part of the shaders
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:10:55] arahael: Don't the A~ and M~series chips have h.254 support builtin?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:11:01] h.264
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:11:03] arahael: nice thanks!
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:11:05] vdamewood: Probably.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[10:11:21] Possibly but they may use proprietary features of the GPU, not sure how much access you have to them
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:11:28] pyzozord: However, putting it through the CPU there like that means, yes, putting it through the CPU.  Ideally you want it to be directly done in the GPU. But not sure what the options there are.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:11:39] pyzozord: You generally want to avoid the CPU entirely where possible.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:11:40] arahael: yeah mobile devices is where my idea comes from. It also bothers me that my cpu spikes when I play youtube. I certainly don't want that for my terminal emulator
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[10:11:51] We already have H265 and they're working on H266
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:11:52] It's times like these that make me wish I had finished learning OpenGL 3.3 once I had a system that supported it.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:12:15] GeDaMo: Yeah, but does Apple have hardware support for them yet?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:12:17] vdamewood: And yet, it's deprecated. :(
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:12:31] I think decoding gifs in GPU shaders is a good idea, I doubt there is any dedicated hardware to gifs :D
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[10:13:01] it might not be possible. The LZW compression used by GIF is inherently sequential
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:13:22] According to https://larryjordan.com/articles/apple-adds-hardware-to-improve-video-compression-speeds/ the M1 can do  H.264, 8-bit HEVC, and 10-bit HEVC using hardware encoding in hardware.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[10:13:26] (you can have sequential dedicated hardware that may be faster than a CPU, but you can't parallelize it by running it on a GPU)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:14:27] immibis: thanks, that's valuable comment
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:14:45] pyzozord: To go with what immibis is saying, on a per-core basis, GPUs tend to be slower than CPUs, they just have orders of magnitude more cores.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:15:39] Which kind of makes me wonder how Apple gets away with having just 16 cores in their GPU.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:15:54] hmm yeah that's true. In the end what I'm looking for is to consume the least amount of energry
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[10:15:57] Depends how they;'re defining a core
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[10:16:35] The easiest way would be to use an atlas of the frames and just switch between them
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:16:38] pyzozord: (j/k) Solid black?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:17:04] vdamewood: doing 0.8 alpha black now :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[10:17:27] pyzozord: least amount of energy? don't animate your terminal backgrounds
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:17:32] Does RAM use moe energy if you store more in it, or is it using 100% power consumption no matter what's loaded?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:17:42] immibis: *with the fancy animated background
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:18:43] vdamewood: I'm not sure but I think ram needs refreshing to not corrupt
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:19:15] vdamewood: but there could be some clever algorithms keeping track of which banks have any data stored, and banks that have no data stored don't get refreshed
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:19:33] So, I guess the question becomes, does that happen?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:19:53] And I left ##hardware in the migration.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:20:09] vdamewood: They moved here, too.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[10:20:31] vdamewood: But yes, most types of RAM require a regular refresh, managed by the RAM components, though, iirc.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pulse	[10:20:40] the big IRC migration of 2021, i will tell my grandsons about it
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:20:56] pulse: You will have grandsons?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pulse	[10:21:01] assuming i ever have grandsons
2021-07-18 01:15:17	immibis	[10:21:02] i don't think there is such an algorithm. However it's possible that refreshing a 0 uses slightly less power than refreshing a 1. Or vice versa.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:21:32] Hmm this gives me some ideas. I guess I should just check what my hardware supports and find a way to make use of that. I got a lenovo thinkpad x230 from 2012, with old i5 and integrated intel graphics, so whatever my device has I guess there is a reasonable chance it's wide spread
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:21:59] pyzozord; Too bad it can't run Windows 11.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:23:10] This may be the first time in a long time that I finally have copies of two versions of Windows in a row.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:23:25] I went from 3.1 to 98 to XP to 7 to 10.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:23:30] vdamewood: it can't? I think I ran windows 11 two weeks ago for a moment to check some driver issues on linux. But not sure if that was windows 11 or 10
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:24:00] pyzozord: Did you sign up for the Insiders' program, and download a beta?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:24:15] oh than no, I download whatever was publically available
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:24:23] 10
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:24:49] This reminds me that I still don't have an ISO of win 10 to run as a VM.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:24:58] sorry, I lost track of windowses. Yeah I gues it was 10. It was looking pretty fancy so I thought it was the newest
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:25:20] on my todo list to get one of those :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:25:30] mrig: Visit this link in a non-Windows OS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:25:53] (If you use Windows, that page will redirect you to the media creation tool.)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:26:12] pyzozord: It is. 11 is still beta.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:26:27] 11 Won't be released until later this year.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:26:45] the page wont open :(
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:27:01] mrig: OS and browser?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:27:31] the browser, seems that all of my add blockers and malicious script blockers have been set off.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	vdamewood	[10:28:00] Yeah, I can't really help with that.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:29:25] just had to go through and slowly allow things until it works, a bit of a pain in the ass.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:30:44] cool, I've got one downloading.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:31:08] not sure if I'll be able to get my licence number and use that or not though.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:31:25] It would be cool to figure out video. I'd love to make games with that technology that Blade Runner had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkwpa5YPhx8
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:31:44] must be a way to do that on a vm, if you've got an original install image.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[10:32:07] It had like video backgrounds but those clips had also depth and lighting information, so it integrated fantastically with the characters
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:33:56] oh cool; I'd no idea that the game existed!

2021-07-18 01:15:17	Intelo	[10:36:44] strategy, no need for that. but in second, I have to make 4 address tables also. Any views?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	furrymcgee	[10:39:31] probably five tables/relations
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pulse	[10:39:34] that's a bit like asking what's better, a big bucket of water of 4 small buckets of water
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pulse	[10:39:46] which is better depends on context i'd say
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pulse	[10:40:11] are you going to be accessing all data on each query, or just one type of data
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[10:46:53] That must have been so satisfying to have worked on at the time, the bladerunner game.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Intelo	[10:50:34] pulse just one type
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:04:17] wow, I can't believe how much juice it takes to simply read a page on medium.com sites.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:04:43] I wonder if some script is being blocked and that is putting it into some perpetual loop.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:05:11] If not that, they must be crypto mining on my resources :D
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:06:27] mrig: This is why I'm very interested in Gemini. :D
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:06:59] yes does make it all the more appealing.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:07:31] this site is running one of my processors at almost 100% all of the time, does anyone else have the same experience?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:08:08] nothing on my system in my day to day use requires this much processing power :|
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[11:08:33] Youtube puts a load on my machine
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-18 01:15:17	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-18 01:15:17	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-18 01:15:17	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-18 01:15:17	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-18 01:15:17	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone
2021-07-18 01:15:17	Intelo	[11:29:18] pulse This https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit?usp=sharing
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:29:24] h0gan: that's a good place to be in imo
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:29:37] h0gan: I'll need to learn read an MBA book myself
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:29:43] wow, this medium.com site does not even scroll correctly.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P
2021-07-18 01:15:17	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-18 01:15:17	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-18 01:15:17	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-18 01:15:17	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-18 01:15:18	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-18 01:15:18	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-18 01:15:18	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-18 01:15:18	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-18 01:15:18	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-18 01:15:18	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-18 01:15:18	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-18 01:15:18	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-18 01:15:18	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-18 01:15:18	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-18 01:15:18	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.

2021-07-18 01:15:18	Mangy_Dog	[15:56:20] https://imgur.com/a/YzOetBF because of the size of the graphic asset i think. Its causing some kind of over load somewhere in the image buffer... So i had to cut back a bit on the fading scan effect making it corser

2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[17:42:17] where things were posted those days
2021-07-18 01:15:18	mrig	[17:42:54] This could be a good place to look too https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/old-releases/

2021-07-18 01:15:18	rannnn8888	[17:54:23] help what him want from me ?https://dpaste.org/8vxw
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[17:55:50] Link doesn't work
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[18:19:08] hello why are types called types when its the same word as typing on a keyboard or types in typesetting
2021-07-18 01:15:18	AlexDelarge	[18:20:05] wow.  just...wow
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pulse	[18:23:37] because english uses 1 word to mean at least 10 things
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[18:24:19] Isn't 'set' the English word with the most meanings?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pulse	[18:24:37] yes, it's most unsettling
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[18:24:52] i thought throughout history in english type has always meant like typing letters but then one day someone came up with types for the things that come with values and variables
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[18:57:13] "type" came from ancient greek, and it means "impression"
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[18:57:20] or "symbol"
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[18:57:36] and it's related to the word "stupid"
2021-07-18 01:15:18	edgar-rft	[18:59:28] isn't all mankind somehow related to the word "stupid"?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[18:59:49] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_derived_from_the_Proto-Indo-European_root_*(s)tewp-
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:01:29] and words "etude", "obtuse", "study" are related
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:03:21] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_derived_from_the_Proto-Indo-European_root_*(s)tewd-
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:03:53] so after millenia we went from stewpid to type theory nice
2021-07-18 01:15:18	W	[19:04:33] so is desuetude when you're sorry for writing a piece of Japanese-inspired music as a study piece?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:05:53] W, it studepends
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:06:59] So today is when my leetcode streak was broken :( It was a one marked as "hard". Can anyone help point me the right direction? https://ideone.com/EVdhwf
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:07:15] nice what is it like to encounter a hard programming problem
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:07:32] beaky: it sucks :(
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:07:37] W, and if you are sorry you have to commit seppuku by traditions of Japan
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:08:02] or you will lose your face!
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:08:15] and it's a shame
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:08:33] i think you can solve it with nested for loops
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:09:47] or with looped nests
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:09:49] i must now make tea so i can fully study your solution
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:10:20] or with loopsted nesps
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:10:38] beaky: I'm interesting in learning other approaches too, but I'd also like to learn what did I do wrong
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:10:47] beaky: thanks! Take your time, I'll stay here few hours
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:12:47] btw, every human eats about 100 spiders while asleep
2021-07-18 01:15:18	novns	[19:12:54] statistics never lies
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:13:25] my solution idea was: treat entire input array as one big number in binary, reversed. Create a prefix sum for each bit position with info what is the decimal value at that point. Then use 2sum algorithm (two pointers moving from edges to the center) to find the cut off points where values for each subarray is equal
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:14:07] so [1,1,0] I treat as 011, so 3, the prefix would be [1,3,3]
2021-07-18 01:15:18	brickfat	[19:15:06] it would nice to be 1 kilobytes operating systems
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:15:21] yes i think it is big endian
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:15:55] beaky: there is no endianess involved in here, there is no bytes. Just long string of bits
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:17:11] just 30⁴ bits with least significant bit at position bits[0]
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:17:31] oh so it is little endian
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:17:51] i thought bits[0] was the most signifincant bit lol
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:17:59] I mean the problem doesn't suggest to treat the string as one big number encoding. This was my idea
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:18:28] oh wait, no, it actually does!
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:19:12] hmm! then I made at least that wrong, the least significant bit is at N-1, I just read the description again
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:25:23] yes i think the idea of the prefix sum is that it is monotonic, so when you grow the bits you get a bigger value so you do not have to search over the entire bit string
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:29:22] beaky: tbh I don't fully understand, but it does sound correct. FYI the prefix sum is my idea, it's not in the problem description
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:31:44] yes i tihnk it is a good idea
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:32:06] i remember leetcode has alot of problems like this
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:34:27] pyzozord: wouldn't each section have the same number of bits set?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	beaky	[19:35:32] yes that is another thing you can use to test the search i think
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:35:42] GeDaMo: yeah same number of bits, but that's not enough, bits need to be in the same places (ignoring leading zeros)
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:36:09] I'm just thinking that if you count the total number of bits then each section has 1/3
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:36:51] and from there adjust the leading zeros somehow?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:37:13] The last section should tell you how many zeroes are on the least significant end
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:37:56] meaning if we have first part 00100 and second part 00100 then moving the left divider is meaningful, because it effectively shifts bits of the first part
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:39:40] GeDaMo: not sure what do you mean by the last part. I would just count all ones. Divide by three. Then linear scan that many from left. This would give me the first part. Then linear scan another that many and that would give me parts two and three
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:40:11] now I may run into problems I mentioned above with shifts on left size and leading zero in right side, so that would need to be adjusted
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:40:21] is that what you mean?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:40:40] sorry, communication, hard, enlish hard, compters, hard
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:41:38] [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0] 6 total bits, counting from the right there are two lower zeros
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:42:04] After you count the three bits from the right, you're looking for two zeroes and a one
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:42:18] Any zeroes before that are leading eroes
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:42:29] ^zeroes
2021-07-18 01:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:42:52] There's probably some clever fast way of doing it though
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:44:06] ooh so you start from the right because then you can safely ignore any leading zeros
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:44:44] so you literally just count the number of 1, then draw a line and move on to the next section, and you start new section by ignoring any leading zeros
2021-07-18 01:15:18	pyzozord	[19:45:02] is that what you mean?
2021-07-18 01:15:18	***	Playback Complete.
2021-07-18 01:15:19	GeDaMo	After you hit the second section from the right you know the number of leading and trailing zeroes

2021-07-18 01:15:53	pyzozord	How do I know that?

2021-07-18 01:17:14	GeDaMo	least significant 1 of 2nd ^   ^ 3 zeroes  ^ two trailing zeroes
2021-07-18 01:17:32	GeDaMo	Leading zeroes = 3 - 2 trailing = 1

2021-07-18 01:18:05	pyzozord	ooh so after you count all 1 you need you keep going with zeros to find out the trailing zeros
2021-07-18 01:18:27	pyzozord	I see I thought you start second section at 0, but you start it at 1
2021-07-18 01:19:09	GeDaMo	Count all the 1s; from the right count trailing zeroes; count (total/3) 1s; count zeroes until next 1

2021-07-18 01:19:28	pyzozord	so just go through, count the 1s and 0s, that gives you the only possible configuration, then check if the binary values are equal, that's it?
2021-07-18 01:19:39	GeDaMo	You shouldn't have to check

2021-07-18 01:24:06	pyzozord	ok, that's a doubly clever idea. I thought my idea was clever, but my idea was brute-force clever, this one is clever-clever
2021-07-18 01:24:17	GeDaMo	I don't think it's clever :|
2021-07-18 01:24:59	pyzozord	I wouldn't have thought about counting ones. I went ahead and build a whole prefix with actual decimal values at each position etc

2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:06:27] mrig: This is why I'm very interested in Gemini. :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:06:59] yes does make it all the more appealing.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:07:31] this site is running one of my processors at almost 100% all of the time, does anyone else have the same experience?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:08:08] nothing on my system in my day to day use requires this much processing power :|
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:08:33] Youtube puts a load on my machine
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-18 04:51:00	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-18 04:51:00	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:24:44] I'm fasting so no
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-18 04:51:00	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-18 04:51:00	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone

2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P

2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU

2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?

2021-07-18 04:51:00	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-18 04:51:00	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-18 04:51:00	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-18 04:51:00	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-18 04:51:00	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rannnn8888	[15:15:46] someone know how use the pack googletrans with proxy ? pythn

2021-07-18 04:51:00	Guest9	[15:18:48] what is show & hide? i think textbox is always visible when put under the design tab
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[15:33:29] i'm still not sure if i like code minimaps or not

2021-07-18 04:51:00	freshgumbubbles4	[15:51:29] Go check up with the operators of the respective proxies
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Mangy_Dog	[15:56:20] https://imgur.com/a/YzOetBF because of the size of the graphic asset i think. Its causing some kind of over load somewhere in the image buffer... So i had to cut back a bit on the fading scan effect making it corser
2021-07-18 04:51:00	meleoron	[17:29:49] is there an easy way to get the oldest releases of popular C programs like GCC or GNU Emacs?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	edgar-rft	[17:34:29] I think wikipedia can tell you that

2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[17:42:02] meleoron, look at USENET comp.sources.*
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[17:42:17] where things were posted those days
2021-07-18 04:51:00	mrig	[17:42:54] This could be a good place to look too https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/old-releases/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	meleoron	[17:46:30] mrig: that worked. thanks!
2021-07-18 04:51:00	rannnn8888	[17:54:23] help what him want from me ?https://dpaste.org/8vxw
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[17:55:50] Link doesn't work
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[18:19:08] hello why are types called types when its the same word as typing on a keyboard or types in typesetting
2021-07-18 04:51:00	AlexDelarge	[18:20:05] wow.  just...wow
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[18:23:37] because english uses 1 word to mean at least 10 things
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[18:24:19] Isn't 'set' the English word with the most meanings?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[18:24:37] yes, it's most unsettling
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[18:24:52] i thought throughout history in english type has always meant like typing letters but then one day someone came up with types for the things that come with values and variables
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[18:57:13] "type" came from ancient greek, and it means "impression"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[18:57:20] or "symbol"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[18:57:36] and it's related to the word "stupid"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	edgar-rft	[18:59:28] isn't all mankind somehow related to the word "stupid"?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[18:59:49] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_derived_from_the_Proto-Indo-European_root_*(s)tewp-
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:01:29] and words "etude", "obtuse", "study" are related
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:03:21] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_derived_from_the_Proto-Indo-European_root_*(s)tewd-
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:03:53] so after millenia we went from stewpid to type theory nice
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[19:04:33] so is desuetude when you're sorry for writing a piece of Japanese-inspired music as a study piece?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:05:53] W, it studepends
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:06:59] So today is when my leetcode streak was broken :( It was a one marked as "hard". Can anyone help point me the right direction? https://ideone.com/EVdhwf
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:07:15] nice what is it like to encounter a hard programming problem
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:07:32] beaky: it sucks :(
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:07:37] W, and if you are sorry you have to commit seppuku by traditions of Japan
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:08:02] or you will lose your face!
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:08:15] and it's a shame
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:08:33] i think you can solve it with nested for loops
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:09:47] or with looped nests
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:09:49] i must now make tea so i can fully study your solution
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:10:20] or with loopsted nesps
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:10:38] beaky: I'm interesting in learning other approaches too, but I'd also like to learn what did I do wrong
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:10:47] beaky: thanks! Take your time, I'll stay here few hours
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:12:47] btw, every human eats about 100 spiders while asleep
2021-07-18 04:51:00	novns	[19:12:54] statistics never lies
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:13:25] my solution idea was: treat entire input array as one big number in binary, reversed. Create a prefix sum for each bit position with info what is the decimal value at that point. Then use 2sum algorithm (two pointers moving from edges to the center) to find the cut off points where values for each subarray is equal
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:14:07] so [1,1,0] I treat as 011, so 3, the prefix would be [1,3,3]
2021-07-18 04:51:00	brickfat	[19:15:06] it would nice to be 1 kilobytes operating systems
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:15:21] yes i think it is big endian
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:15:55] beaky: there is no endianess involved in here, there is no bytes. Just long string of bits
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:17:11] just 30⁴ bits with least significant bit at position bits[0]
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:17:31] oh so it is little endian
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:17:51] i thought bits[0] was the most signifincant bit lol
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:17:59] I mean the problem doesn't suggest to treat the string as one big number encoding. This was my idea
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:18:28] oh wait, no, it actually does!
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:19:12] hmm! then I made at least that wrong, the least significant bit is at N-1, I just read the description again
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:25:23] yes i think the idea of the prefix sum is that it is monotonic, so when you grow the bits you get a bigger value so you do not have to search over the entire bit string
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:29:22] beaky: tbh I don't fully understand, but it does sound correct. FYI the prefix sum is my idea, it's not in the problem description
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:31:44] yes i tihnk it is a good idea
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:32:06] i remember leetcode has alot of problems like this
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:34:27] pyzozord: wouldn't each section have the same number of bits set?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[19:35:32] yes that is another thing you can use to test the search i think
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:35:42] GeDaMo: yeah same number of bits, but that's not enough, bits need to be in the same places (ignoring leading zeros)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:36:09] I'm just thinking that if you count the total number of bits then each section has 1/3
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:36:51] and from there adjust the leading zeros somehow?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:37:13] The last section should tell you how many zeroes are on the least significant end
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:37:56] meaning if we have first part 00100 and second part 00100 then moving the left divider is meaningful, because it effectively shifts bits of the first part
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:39:40] GeDaMo: not sure what do you mean by the last part. I would just count all ones. Divide by three. Then linear scan that many from left. This would give me the first part. Then linear scan another that many and that would give me parts two and three
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:40:11] now I may run into problems I mentioned above with shifts on left size and leading zero in right side, so that would need to be adjusted
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:40:21] is that what you mean?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:40:40] sorry, communication, hard, enlish hard, compters, hard
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:41:38] [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0] 6 total bits, counting from the right there are two lower zeros
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:42:04] After you count the three bits from the right, you're looking for two zeroes and a one
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:42:18] Any zeroes before that are leading eroes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:42:29] ^zeroes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:42:52] There's probably some clever fast way of doing it though
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:44:06] ooh so you start from the right because then you can safely ignore any leading zeros
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:44:44] so you literally just count the number of 1, then draw a line and move on to the next section, and you start new section by ignoring any leading zeros
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:45:02] is that what you mean?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:45:18] After you hit the second section from the right you know the number of leading and trailing zeroes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:45:53] How do I know that?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:47:13]         [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:47:14] least significant 1 of 2nd ^   ^ 3 zeroes  ^ two trailing zeroes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:47:32] Leading zeroes = 3 - 2 trailing = 1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:48:05] ooh so after you count all 1 you need you keep going with zeros to find out the trailing zeros
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:48:27] I see I thought you start second section at 0, but you start it at 1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:49:09] Count all the 1s; from the right count trailing zeroes; count (total/3) 1s; count zeroes until next 1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:49:28] so just go through, count the 1s and 0s, that gives you the only possible configuration, then check if the binary values are equal, that's it?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:49:39] You shouldn't have to check
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:50:27] Actually, I suppose you can count the leading zeroes on the left
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:51:37] I don't see why I don't need to check after I walked through everything
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:52:48] Ah, right, it's possible that the values are not the same
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:54:03] If the number of bits isn't divisible by 3, that's an error too
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:54:06] ok, that's a doubly clever idea. I thought my idea was clever, but my idea was brute-force clever, this one is clever-clever
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:54:17] I don't think it's clever :|
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:54:59] I wouldn't have thought about counting ones. I went ahead and build a whole prefix with actual decimal values at each position etc
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:55:16] also no idea why my code doesn't work :(
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[19:55:28] GeDaMo: thanks for taking the time to help me :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:55:39] You don't have to do all the shifting either, once you have the start positions of the three segments, you can just compare them
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[19:56:10] Compare the list slices, that is
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[20:00:08] yes i think it is big endian but if you do it from the right then you wont have to deal with leading zeroes
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[20:00:28] just find the next leading one and then compare
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:00:52] Yeah got it, count leading zeros from the right, then count total_ones/3 of ones, then first next one, that position - leading_zeros is your right cut off line, repeat for the left cut off line. Once you have three slices combare decimal values. done
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:01:37] You don't need to convert to decimal
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[20:01:49] yes from the right its great because the zeroes already get nice and factored in
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:01:54] Unless that would be faster than just comparing the list slices
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[20:02:03] (tho if the problem used little endian then it would've been from the left)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:02:20] GeDaMo: oh right, true forgot those aren't actual bits
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:03:22] I'm not sure why it asks you to return two numbers when the question is really 'how big is each section?'
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:03:29] They'd all be the same size
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[20:04:48] i thought the sizes will be different if they had extra zeroes on the left
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:05:05] Can there be extra zeroes?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:05:17] I thought if it matched all the sections were the same
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:05:56] Well, that makes it a little more complex, not much though
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:07:18] GeDaMo: I think it doesn't have to be the same size, if you have many zeros on the right
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:07:32] Left
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:07:48] Left
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:08:15] left is most significant therefore leading zeros on the less are meaningless
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:08:32] Yeah
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:08:47] "leading" zeros on the right, are meaningful, they are more like bitshifts
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:09:01] well confusing comparisons, they are like zeros in 100
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:09:27] or zeros in 123000, those are meaningful zeros
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[20:09:33] digits on left can inform you of the type's hardware limitations
2021-07-18 04:51:00	GeDaMo	[20:10:01] Significant digits
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[20:10:12] yes this is why litte endian is superior
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:10:41] so least significant zeros are meaningful, because they are suffix
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:10:56] most significant zeros are meaningless because they are prefix and they don't affect decimal value
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[20:11:04] https://i.imgur.com/ld6hgMU.jpg
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[20:11:49] pulse: that is... funy and disturbing :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[20:11:54] :-)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:31] https://imgur.com/a/vC77k0h  Ok need a little advice... As you can see i have the spear grow out. Its just a point primitive with an increasing radius. What i want to do is make the  point markers appear as the points radius passes them.  What i need help with is figuring out how to check if the point is within the radius of that point. the coordinates of the markers are in XY in pixels
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:31] (+ the offset of the mini display frame) Any ideas?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:49] if you reply say my name so i get pinged :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[21:11:50] nice blinking lights
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:11:53] Mangy_Dog, what is that thing? looks awesome
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Mangy_Dog	[21:12:14] tricorder prop :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[21:12:27] yes this is the most impressive thing ive seen in a while
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:12:43] Mangy_Dog, and the solution to your problem is simply to measure distance from those points to your circle's center, and then compare that to the the current radius
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Mangy_Dog	[21:16:15] som eone gave me the forumlar also some one else showed me this https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-a-point-lies-inside-a-sphere-or-not/
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Mangy_Dog	[21:16:18] seems about right
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:17:16] wait, a sphere is 3D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	 *	pulse [21:17:33] raises eyebrow
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:18:01] and that looks very much 2D to me
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Mangy_Dog	[21:18:27] na 2d
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:19:28] if it's 2D you can just check if your current radius is within distance-delta, distance+delta
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:19:42] where distance is the distance between your expanding circle's center and the point of interest
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:20:02] and delta is some arbitrary number
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:20:12] used because typically these things aren't 100% precise
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:20:19] esp. if you're using floats
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:21:04] if it is, activate point (and make sure it doesn't activate again)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:28:27] it's the same problem with circle or sphere
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:28:55] actually if all you need is checking if the point is inside a circle it's then just radius > distance(P1,P2)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:29:05] or rather radius >= dist(P1,P2)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:29:15] P1 being center of the expanding circle
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:29:36] radius > euclidean_distance(center,P)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:29:47] :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:30:42] doesn't matter for circle, sphere or a multidimensional "rounded object" :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:31:03] yeah sphere is just one extra dimension
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:31:09] would be different for oval though
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:31:17] ellipse, you mean?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:31:28] yeah, that
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:31:30] that's a fun problem :)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:31:37] get's more annoying with 3D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:32:30] for circle it's trivial because the radius always represents the border
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:32:46] for oval you need a somewhat long equation
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:32:52] ellipse you have you use an INEQUATION
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:32:58] eh, i mean elipse
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:32:59] lol
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:33:07] ellipse*
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:33:43] you get the parametric equation of the ellipse and turn it into an inequation for the test point
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:33:54] hmm
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:34:05] quickly google it and you will see it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:34:31] assuming you are familiar with inequations and parametric equations
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:35:01] that was barely covered by my primary school math classes, but I have a degree in engineering, so I had a REFRESH :D
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[21:35:28] calculus, linear algebra and everything else which comes in the math package for engineers
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pulse	[21:37:34] differential equations :p
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[21:38:38] cool, but not a big deal, just geometry stuff
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[21:39:32] the cool stuff is that if that's actually camera on a bigger plane he should use some kind of space indexing for the points so he doesn't check every single point every single frame
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[21:41:50] this projects looks like either a cool arcade game or a military project undercover of a cool arcade game
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:04:38] I do need to really refresh elementary math and study up to calculus. I had to look up what inequations were
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:05:59] What's the cleanest functional construct for converting a list(like) to a boolean that is true if all elements are equal? In Java's stream API the best I have come up with is .map(Optional::of).reduce((a,b)->a.equalTo(b)?a:empty()).get(), but this is clunky, and Java might or might not have something better, but what do more pure functional languages do?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:06:55] sorry. .isPresent(), not .get()
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:07:48] yeah that's hideous
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:08:50] why not just iterate the list?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:08:51] W: in js we have .some() and .every()
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:09:32] pyzozord, those sounds like they might take predicates on elements, not pair of elements?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:09:49] oh true
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:10:08] I mean, you can slice off the first element and compare the rest to it, but that seems clunky too
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:10:22] but you could do ar.every(el => el == ar[0])
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:10:54] you don't have to slice off an element, just compare with the next elem
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:10:54] check if each element is equal to first element will also confirm that all elements are equal
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:11:05] pyzozord, well, that'd work in the case of arrays
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:11:07] oh special case when count=1
2021-07-18 04:51:00	xsperry	[22:11:38] in a lazy functional language, like haskell, you can just call foldr (reduce) with && function:  allTrue = foldr (&&) True
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:11:50] xsperry, excellent, thanks
2021-07-18 04:51:00	xsperry	[22:12:13] it will stop once the first element is False
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:12:16] That was my real question, truly. Even if I can't find a Java equivalent to that, I know what to model a convenience function on
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:12:22] what if there are no elements
2021-07-18 04:51:00	edk	[22:12:23] xsperry: haven't you jsut implemented all?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:12:28] xsperry, oh, that's not what I asked for
2021-07-18 04:51:00	edk	[22:12:34] what if there are 0 elements or 1 elements?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	xsperry	[22:12:44] edk, it returns True (second argument of foldr)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	xsperry	[22:12:52] W, oh, sorry, I misread
2021-07-18 04:51:00	edk	[22:12:54] i'm asking about the function W wants
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:13:07] edk, both true
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:13:30] more accurately I guess I should say "returns false if there are two differing elements"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:14:06] (I mean true is fine too, a negation is not ugly here if the rest is elegant)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	davve_	[22:14:08] ideally you want to stop iterating then too
2021-07-18 04:51:00	davve_	[22:14:26] javascript has every and some for these occasions
2021-07-18 04:51:00	davve_	[22:14:31] quite handy actually
2021-07-18 04:51:00	davve_	[22:15:18] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:15:27] what specifically the Java solution gives you is parallelizability - not a hard requirement, but it's convenient when it's a pure reduce
2021-07-18 04:51:00	 *	W [22:19:10] looks for actual functional code that does this to draw from as example
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:22:55] seems like the common solution is a groupby
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:23:11] W does your java code handle empty list?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:24:18] lars8, sort of, I simplified it a bit. Reduce itself returns an optional, so it's even uglier than what I showed. The outer optional is empty if the stream is empty
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:25:33] (so you get e.g. Optional<Optional<ElementType>>)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:30:25] assuming you're not going for a one liner, this works: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/ZRSdUe2z
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:31:17] definition of and is what xsperry posted above, foldr (&&) True, so you can write it like that as well
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:32:07] so: allEqual (x:xs) = foldr (&&) True (map (==x) xs)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:32:28] writing out the type is optional, but it is allEqual :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[22:34:03] nice i like haskell
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:37:06] it looks a lot cleaner in Haskell than Java, that's for sure, but I kind of still don't like it. But thanks for providing what I asked after, regardless
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:39:14] I guess my code is blowing up the interpreter but I can't figure out why. Why Why Why???!!!  :)   Everything looks in order. At first I thought it was the paste site I was using but an other paste site (and locally) give the same result.  It looks like it's executing every control block without regard to the conditions.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[22:39:18] yes the foldr is the most natural approach it builds the value from the list
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[22:40:23] foldr the ultimate structure-preserving transformation
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:40:30] also, I guess there's a conflict of interest between parallelizability and short-circuiting on knowing the conclusion halfway through; at least if you want both, you would need a coordinating mechanism to cancel pending comparisons, which might just be more expensive than what you gain
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:42:24] indeed
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:43:35] W: you could do some chunking, having more "threads" than cpu threads would be counter productive anway, so it will be split up into 2..64 chunks, not that many chunks
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:45:37] if(condition) {...} else {...}  Is there any scenario in which both blcoks could be executed?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:45:47] pyzozord, I mean, the Java implementation does do that, just without any way to cancel if you have the answer after a chunk. It creates n*2 threads, iirc
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:46:15] blahboybaz, depends on language; e.g. one with goto or equivalent could do it
2021-07-18 04:51:00	WarauSalesman	[22:46:24] W: just use .allMatch()
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:46:31] I think pyzozord meant to split the list into chunks, then process each chunk on its own, in parallel
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:46:35] much more likely you just got the syntax wrong though, some nested if you missed
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:47:01] ideally, number of elements in a chunk would equal the number of CPU threads
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:47:07] lars8: yes that's what I meant, I had the impression that W understood that the same way as well
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:47:46] I meant n*2 where n=number of cores
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:48:04] W: Node (javascript).
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:48:10] blahboybaz, perhaps in the sense that a compiler might optimize the branch out if they both do exactly the same thing, also branch preditction will run both
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:48:22] lars8: I meant more of number of chunks equal to number of CPU threads to be honest. Then each cpu can do just a linear scan. The first one to find a missmatch needs to inform other threads they can stop
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:48:54] blahboybaz, then no, not that I can think of. Like I said, if it looks like it does, probably something else wrong and the code doesn't mean what you think it does
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[22:49:18] yes can you paste the rest of the code
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:49:30] This is what I have: https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5g9r9uk  - and -  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_nodejs_online.php
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:49:37] I can't figure it out
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:49:45] The code looks fine to me
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[22:50:01] pyzozord, that complicates the code though. and adds synchronization overhead.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:50:28] yeah that's true, insert a sync check ever 100 elements for example or so
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:50:38] I've made it way too complex
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:50:45] Ok it's time for me to go
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:51:10] W: I tried to hepl but I'm "punching up" here so sorry if I wasnt too helpful ;)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	pyzozord	[22:52:40] "punching up" in the sense of "trying to help someone more experience than me"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[22:53:16] I'm using Zig and am trying to read user input. What's the ideomatic way to handle an input that's bigger than my buffer (preferably without @panic)?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[22:53:54] Right now, I'm using an arena allocator and .alloc(u8, 100), but that can only accept 98-99 chars
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:53:55] usually line by line
2021-07-18 04:51:00	beaky	[22:54:13] blahboybaz: i think the +> in line 16 should be => but which part of the program's output seems incorrect?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Ox151	[22:54:33] hello, how can i remove commits from github, not local git
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[22:54:46] eyynet4: line by line? I'm only reading one line (simple rock-paper-scissors game)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	W	[22:54:58] It was an idle side thought anyway. I've decided on `.collect(groupingBy(identity())).size()<=1`, which is cleaner than what I had, and doesn't need to extract an element from the stream, or use foreach or an explicit loop or anything like that
2021-07-18 04:51:00	Ox151	[22:54:59] i have tried git reset --hard [hash] and then git push -f origin master but the push says everything is already up to date
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:55:23] so you would load one line into your buffer
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:55:32] and then discard it when done
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[22:55:50] I only have one line I need to read, though
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[22:56:34] And it feels wrong to panic on an input that's too long
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:56:55] only one round of RPS? blaphsemy!
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:57:15] someone always wants a "2 out of 3"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[22:57:20] I can call it in a loop, no problem there
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[22:58:39] I suppose I'll just truncate it at 99 chars and go from there
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:58:40] beaky: I saw that - it is not that way in the other places it was me making a change to try and see what was going on and making that mistake - you caught that in exactly the 15 seconds it was like that.
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:58:52] what are you truncating?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:58:53] With that corrected the problem I'be been dealing with is revealed
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:59:16] why is the input anywhere near 90 chars
2021-07-18 04:51:00	blahboybaz	[22:59:31] in the other paste site I mean - The prolem underlies that typo though
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[22:59:52] your maximum line length should be the buffer size
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[22:59:57] Right
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[23:01:43] Well that seems to work
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[23:01:47] if you're not seeing a newline then you will have to keep reading until you get to the new line
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[23:03:00] This is all my code, if that helps https://0x0.st/-V8j.zig\
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[23:03:18] ingore the trailing backslash (typo)
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[23:05:14] "readUntilDelimiterOrEof" but what about "end of buffer"  ?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	swl	[23:05:44] It'll throw a StreamTooLong if it doesn't fit
2021-07-18 04:51:00	lars8	[23:05:49] what language is that?
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[23:06:03] hopefully they are storing length in "var buf"
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[23:06:05] zig
2021-07-18 04:51:00	eyynet4	[23:13:57] s/length/size/

2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:06:59] yes does make it all the more appealing.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:07:31] this site is running one of my processors at almost 100% all of the time, does anyone else have the same experience?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:08:08] nothing on my system in my day to day use requires this much processing power :|
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:08:33] Youtube puts a load on my machine
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:08:56] What's annoying is that the thousands of lines of JS on Youtube have nothing to do with decoding the video
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:09:45] crazy stuff really.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:12:43] I _really_ like Lagrange and Gemini at the moment.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:12:52] (It's not going to replace the web, though)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:19:33] GeDaMo: I just discovered mpv, it works with youtube-dl. The cpu usage is amaizingly low
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:20:31] I have 4 cores, most of the time they run at 800MHz because I'm not doing anything intensive
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:21:01] I can play an mp4 off my hard disk and that doesn't change but when I go to YT 2 or 3 of the cores jump to 3000MHz
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:22:32] hello I am meeting someone in few minutes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:22:54] they wanted to meet me for "short term business" purposes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:23:04] what things am I expecting to discuss
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:23:36] I'm thinking: 1. They know someone who has an idea that they want implemented
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:23:49] 2. They want to partner with me to form a small agency
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:23:51] what else
2021-07-18 05:12:19	h0gan	[11:24:05] They want you to detail their car
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:24:11] uh
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:24:18] I'm very very very tired
2021-07-18 05:12:19	h0gan	[11:24:22] Very short term, but you'll get paid.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:24:37] OverCoder: Perhaps use your remaining minute to get a glass of tea.

2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:24:47] OverCoder: this is programming channel, we can help you more with technical aspects, but this sounds like more business question
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:24:52] also dislike tea in 41 C weather
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:24:56] pyzozord, fair
2021-07-18 05:12:19	h0gan	[11:25:05] Sounds more of a fortune telling question
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:25:06] I was speaking from a freelancer programmer perspective but fair
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:25:09] 41 C, that's as bad as our mild summar.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:25:12] OverCoder: but you can hope, maybe someone just happens to have opinion/experience
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:25:18] yep :P
2021-07-18 05:12:19	h0gan	[11:25:45] Whenever someone asks me to meet to talk about a "Business Idea", it's generally them pitching something and hoping I can help with the technical stuff.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:26:21] btw difference between mpv and gnome-mpv (an mpv frontend)? 4% cpu vs 10% cpu...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:26:33] h0gan, I kind of want the opposite
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:26:45] the thing is I live in Syria and the wages are super low I generally don't work for anyone locally
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Intelo	[11:26:47] pulse https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit%20%20lll
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:26:58] in a poll, 48% of programmers in Syria get paid less than $30/mo
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:27:20] it bothers me as hell, I feel like I'm wasting my processors longevity on constantly taxing it 10% by watching youtube
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:27:21] that's like 6 meals
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:27:48] so clients go ahead and expect me to be the same kinda person and make them a facebook clone for $200
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:28:01] it's like you ride 50km/h on third gear always
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:28:04] just wasteful
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:28:27] no, it makes no sense at all
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[11:28:46] 2 coffees a day and the monthly wage is gone
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Intelo	[11:29:18] pulse This https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EJwSKDywrF-duJ-mSlPU3326QCJsqtj-f84dGlT7oSM/edit?usp=sharing
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:29:24] h0gan: that's a good place to be in imo
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:29:37] h0gan: I'll need to learn read an MBA book myself
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:29:43] wow, this medium.com site does not even scroll correctly.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:30:26] heh tail feathers so long that it can not longer fly :S
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:30:41] mrig: it's all terrible, I gave up on the web for the most part
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:31:07] we could fly to the moon with whatever many megahertzs
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:31:27] mrig: That's all why I dislike "webapps", too.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:31:46] and now we can't see gifs without a supercomputer on the desk
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:31:48] I haven't tried this myself "woob is a collection of applications able to interact with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser." https://woob.tech/
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:32:10] pyzozord: I doubt that the Apollo computer had "megahertz" :P
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:32:36] Oh, I'm wrong, it was 2 MHz
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:32:55] :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:33:04] I was thinking it would have like 48Mhz or something
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:33:39] 2MHz, that's crazy! And that girl who was applo engineer? A stack of books taller then her...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:34:10] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:34:33] sorry, here is english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:35:22] I was just going to say that the web was not designed by Margaret Hamilton :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:35:43] It just grows like an unkempt garden.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:36:12] and there has not been enough time for a decent ecosystem to evolve, it is still all weeds :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:36:52] I'd say there is an ecosystem but whether it's decent is... Not really up for debate here.  It's awful.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:36:53] perhaps eventually we'll have an web ancient forest of wisdom, keeping it positive :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:37:01] I think Elon Musk makes a great point when he says that technology does not evolve by itself. It's many smart people working hard to evolve it. Technology by itself degrades
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:37:32] arahael: Perhaps we are still in the brush and weeds stage, no really trees as yet.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:37:56] Perhaps
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:38:14] I have to say that wikipedia is one of the "killer app" of the web and it is how web should be used (aside of how accurate the contents are)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:38:27] sure there will be eventually, just the way that things evolve.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:38:56] pyzozord: it has as many respected editors as most national encyclopedias.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[11:39:21] arahael I've tried to put the serverthread and the clientthread as separate apps. It hasn't improved the total time to send those messages.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:39:23] The thing is that it crosses boundaries, so those editors start to squabble as to what the 'truth' is.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:39:48] oh Hamilgton is still alive. I need to check out if there are any interviews with her
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:39:55] Perhaps it will morph someday into the 'Hitchikers Guide' ?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:40:12] mathAndRhetoric: Threads and Processes are remarkably similar today. The main difference is the degree if isolation, but that's a blurry line.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:40:16] pyzozord: I would be very interested to Hear the lady speak :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:40:19] *degree _of_ isolation.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:40:29] please do let me know if you find anything...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[11:40:40] Here's my simple Java code: https://zerobin.net/?81250e0538d04ba1#0w5xP6iVCipCneUzqYU6MkmokuTytaNRnWjkkLPB4PI= It takes 9s. Any idea why it's so slow? It's not because of threads as I've tried running the server and the client as separate apps.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:41:38] mrig: https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:43:19] I need to find some cli for searching youtube, and hook it up with my mpv, then I won't need to even open the damned website
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[11:43:25] Intelo, sorry, i'm not really all that good with databases
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[11:43:45] just use sensible design
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:43:57] maybe tha woob.tech thing will work
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:44:11] Intelo: Wow, the developer for that website needs to get up with the times.  It claims my browser is 'no-longer supported'.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[11:44:21] arahael that's good to know. Threads are not the cause. So, what's left? The architecture of the app only uses Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:44:33] Intelo: > The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a supported browser
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[11:44:34] pyzozord: Oh thank you, superb.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:45:44] mrig: it seems even more up your ally since you are interested in astrology
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:46:28] mrig: in the first three minutes there was a lot of words about software and space :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:46:50] mathAndRhetoric: I vaguely remember last time I saw the code that I suggested that you might not be buffering right.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[11:47:14] mrig: astronomy... I'm so sorry
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[11:47:39] arahael the architecture reduces to: BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream())); with 100,000x bufferedWriter.write(str)  where str is char[1024].  And BufferedReader in =  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); with in.readLine() until the line ends with a tilda character to exit.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:48:47] mathAndRhetoric: Well, is socket itself buffered?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	ze26zefo	[11:49:18] i need a way to install teamviewer on a pc with just plugging in usb
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:49:30] my monitor of my desktop pc stopped working
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:49:42] i only have my laptop left
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Twix	[11:50:28] then you should get a new one
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:50:39] but i need to access programs now
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:50:42] as of today
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:50:45] kind of urgent
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:51:02] Does the laptop not have an Internet connection?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Twix	[11:51:07] i can ssh on all of my systems
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Intelo	[11:51:10] arahael try another one
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:51:16] Intelo: Nah. :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[11:51:22] Intelo: I like Safari.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:51:22] GeDaMo: it does
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Twix	[11:51:27] tolarz, didn't you setup anything simiilar?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:51:31] no :(
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Twix	[11:51:44] then, learn from it :>
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Intelo	[11:52:09] arahael :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:54:07] tolarz: which OS?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:54:48] windows 10
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:55:28] "TeamViewer Portable generally comprises all the features of the full  version of TeamViewer without the need to install anything. Instead,  TeamViewer Portable runs directly from a USB stick or the Cloud " https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:56:45] Also, just a thought: if you have a TV with an HDMI connector, maybe you could use that as a monitor for your desktop PC temporarily
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:56:55] no i don't have any other monitor :(
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:57:02] do you think i could run teamviewer "blindly"?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:57:07] just with keyboard shorcuts?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[11:57:17] I don't know what TeamViewer is
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[11:57:24] maybe use windows' accessibility things to get a screen reader
2021-07-18 05:12:19	h0gan	[12:01:53] GeDaMo: New Man Utd kit sponsor! (and also a remote desktop software thingie)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[12:02:01] Ah :P
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[12:02:38] From the name I might have guessed at some kind of video calling thingie
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[12:02:42] For teams
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Rounin	[12:03:09] There are far too few football remote desktop solutions
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Rounin	[12:03:57] Imagine if you could use your remote whatever to give the team directions during the game, though... 3000 votes, and all players must wear a melon on their head
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[12:04:34] I remember an old scifi story like that, the manager could remotely control the players
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[12:05:16] Then they counted the antennas on the other teams side and got 12 - they were also controlling the ref :P
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Rounin	[12:05:26] :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	h0gan	[12:05:33] XD
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Rounin	[12:07:30] tolarz: How far is it to an electronics store, though? You can get some pretty cheap monitors nowadays, after all
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Rounin	[12:07:52] Though perhaps they've become more expensive after the chip shortage
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[12:10:36] hm good idea
2021-07-18 05:12:19	tolarz	[12:10:43] actually it's just the power supply to the monitor that's broken
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[12:21:12] ok
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[12:21:16] it was about initiating an agency
2021-07-18 05:12:19	OverCoder	[12:21:23] offer rejected successfully ✅
2021-07-18 05:12:19	h0gan	[12:25:09] OverCoder: Good call!
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[12:36:28] Oh this is a fascinating observation "Systems are asynchronous, distributed and event driven in nature". She then goes on to mention that there no longer be the need to define schedules of when events should occur, but prefers communication between objects.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[12:36:54] https://youtu.be/ZbVOF0Uk5lU?t=1618
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:43:45] arahael not sure how to answer that. I'm digging deep into the source of sockets in Java.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:44:11] arahael and I found TCP performance depends on transfer rate * ping time. source: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[12:44:29] I'm not sure you're using TCP if it's local, though.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:22] arahael good point. What is it using if it's a TCP socket on localhost?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[12:45:32]  mrig: very cool talk :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:45:40] on Windows 10...
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[12:46:34] pyzozord: It would be a really cool game project to model some complicated system.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[12:46:56] mrig: I'm not sure how complicated that is but factorio comes to mind
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[12:46:58] and make it full interactive across several different scenarios.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:47:55] arahael according to Microsoft, sockets on localhost use TCP/IP loopback
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[12:48:16] I think it would be as complicated as coding for the real thing, if you were to make it a full emulation.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[12:51:06] simulate would perhaps be a better term there.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[12:55:42] mathAndRhetoric: Well, have you tried not using a buffer at all? What about an 8 MB buffer?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:56:11] arahael yes, not using buffer at all on read - no change. Not using buffer at all on write - then it takes 40s
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[12:56:53] mathAndRhetoric: Try a much larger buffer on write, then.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[12:57:21] mathAndRhetoric: You're using 1 kB buffer, yeah?  Try 8 MB.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:06] arahael Socket has a rcv_buf which I'm currently researching from the RFC: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/StandardSocketOptions.html#SO_RCVBUF
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:23] arahael and then the buffered reader has some internal buffer that I'll research from the source code
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mathAndRhetoric	[12:58:38] as well as buffered writer (that I'll increase to 8MB)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	arahael	[12:59:42] mathAndRhetoric: SO_SNDBUF as well on the writing thread.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[13:14:06] pyzozord: I was more thinking along the lines of space mission simulation games, that sort of thing, modeling the systems involved.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[13:14:46] Fascinating that she cites interface errors being the most common source of problems.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[13:15:20] I suppose it is always going to be the least predictable part of the runtime.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[13:18:52] Very telling that her observations of preventative action were ignored, and the response to her correct voiced concerns was that 'astronauts do not make mistakes'.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[13:19:16] caustic vs thoughtful natures.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	dan01	[13:28:54] Can someone point me to some resources on introduction to domain driven development?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[13:53:16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEFdLKsQL0M
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[13:53:21] i wonder if programmers do this type of thing too
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:07:19] Oh wow, my wacom has got such an annoying bug in its hardware :|
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:07:50] fixed it several times only to have the effect of putting it back together break it again.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:10:11] pulse: reminds me of my grandfather playing pictionary one time, for polyester he drew its molecular form :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[14:10:20] lol
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:13:58] Oh this device has got so many tiny screws, not sure that I have the heart to pull it apart again today :|
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:20:18] mrig: there is Kerbal Space Program
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:20:58] mrig: yes I loled at the mention of interface problems. Funny how software seems to be bound to interface since the very beginnings
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:22:05] It could be that interface systems are difficult to construct because part of the system is inherintly unstable: the carbon algorithm (aka humans)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:23:55] I've found that it's not that vlc or mpv are particular faster or slower, but the video encoded specific way can spike my cpu or not
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:23:59] pyzozord: the interface is the device really.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:25:08] it is how it interacts with the world, taking interface to mean the UI and the interface with all hardware devices,; which is, I think, what it implied.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:26:18] yes, that's interesting line of tought, interface is in some sense the i/o of the program. If program doesn't have i/o, it doesn't matter how complex computation it is doing, it's as if it wasn't doing anything
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:26:42] In some sense i/o is everything and the only thing
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:27:01] Yes I think so.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:27:14] The interaction with the world.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:29:10] well, at least we can safely assume, that interface is not to be dismissed, if the person who literally coined the Software Engineering term, brings it up as something to be mindful of
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:29:56] (fact that she her software was sending people to space is secondary :D)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:31:11] It's also very interesting how many things are still relevant, how we still struggle with the same challanges
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:31:44] Very glad I watched that talk
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:33:30] interesting that avc1.64001f codec takes 2.5% cpu and avc1.64001F takes 5%
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:37:29] ah might be that 5% is what I get when running on codec that doesn't have hardware support
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[14:38:37] https://blog.pearce.org.nz/2013/11/what-does-h264avc1-codecs-parameters.html
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[14:41:26] Maybe it's the resolution that's the reason for the difference?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[14:45:49] I need to experiment with this a bit more, but this is already much much better than the 15%-20% via chrome
2021-07-18 05:12:19	mrig	[14:50:21] pyzozord: Yes me too, thanks for linking, i've taken a few notes and have links to some key points that she makes recorded now.

2021-07-18 05:12:19	rannnn8888	[17:54:23] help what him want from me ?https://dpaste.org/8vxw
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[17:55:50] Link doesn't work
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[18:19:08] hello why are types called types when its the same word as typing on a keyboard or types in typesetting
2021-07-18 05:12:19	AlexDelarge	[18:20:05] wow.  just...wow
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[18:23:37] because english uses 1 word to mean at least 10 things
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[18:24:19] Isn't 'set' the English word with the most meanings?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[18:24:37] yes, it's most unsettling
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[18:24:52] i thought throughout history in english type has always meant like typing letters but then one day someone came up with types for the things that come with values and variables
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[18:57:13] "type" came from ancient greek, and it means "impression"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[18:57:20] or "symbol"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[18:57:36] and it's related to the word "stupid"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	edgar-rft	[18:59:28] isn't all mankind somehow related to the word "stupid"?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[18:59:49] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_derived_from_the_Proto-Indo-European_root_*(s)tewp-
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:01:29] and words "etude", "obtuse", "study" are related
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:03:21] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_derived_from_the_Proto-Indo-European_root_*(s)tewd-
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:03:53] so after millenia we went from stewpid to type theory nice
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[19:04:33] so is desuetude when you're sorry for writing a piece of Japanese-inspired music as a study piece?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:05:53] W, it studepends
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:06:59] So today is when my leetcode streak was broken :( It was a one marked as "hard". Can anyone help point me the right direction? https://ideone.com/EVdhwf
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:07:15] nice what is it like to encounter a hard programming problem
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:07:32] beaky: it sucks :(
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:07:37] W, and if you are sorry you have to commit seppuku by traditions of Japan
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:08:02] or you will lose your face!
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:08:15] and it's a shame
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:08:33] i think you can solve it with nested for loops
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:09:47] or with looped nests
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:09:49] i must now make tea so i can fully study your solution
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:10:20] or with loopsted nesps
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:10:38] beaky: I'm interesting in learning other approaches too, but I'd also like to learn what did I do wrong
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:10:47] beaky: thanks! Take your time, I'll stay here few hours
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:12:47] btw, every human eats about 100 spiders while asleep
2021-07-18 05:12:19	novns	[19:12:54] statistics never lies
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:13:25] my solution idea was: treat entire input array as one big number in binary, reversed. Create a prefix sum for each bit position with info what is the decimal value at that point. Then use 2sum algorithm (two pointers moving from edges to the center) to find the cut off points where values for each subarray is equal
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:14:07] so [1,1,0] I treat as 011, so 3, the prefix would be [1,3,3]
2021-07-18 05:12:19	brickfat	[19:15:06] it would nice to be 1 kilobytes operating systems
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:15:21] yes i think it is big endian
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:15:55] beaky: there is no endianess involved in here, there is no bytes. Just long string of bits
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:17:11] just 30⁴ bits with least significant bit at position bits[0]
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:17:31] oh so it is little endian
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:17:51] i thought bits[0] was the most signifincant bit lol
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:17:59] I mean the problem doesn't suggest to treat the string as one big number encoding. This was my idea
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:18:28] oh wait, no, it actually does!
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:19:12] hmm! then I made at least that wrong, the least significant bit is at N-1, I just read the description again
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:25:23] yes i think the idea of the prefix sum is that it is monotonic, so when you grow the bits you get a bigger value so you do not have to search over the entire bit string
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:29:22] beaky: tbh I don't fully understand, but it does sound correct. FYI the prefix sum is my idea, it's not in the problem description
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:31:44] yes i tihnk it is a good idea
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:32:06] i remember leetcode has alot of problems like this
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:34:27] pyzozord: wouldn't each section have the same number of bits set?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[19:35:32] yes that is another thing you can use to test the search i think
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:35:42] GeDaMo: yeah same number of bits, but that's not enough, bits need to be in the same places (ignoring leading zeros)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:36:09] I'm just thinking that if you count the total number of bits then each section has 1/3
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:36:51] and from there adjust the leading zeros somehow?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:37:13] The last section should tell you how many zeroes are on the least significant end
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:37:56] meaning if we have first part 00100 and second part 00100 then moving the left divider is meaningful, because it effectively shifts bits of the first part
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:39:40] GeDaMo: not sure what do you mean by the last part. I would just count all ones. Divide by three. Then linear scan that many from left. This would give me the first part. Then linear scan another that many and that would give me parts two and three
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:40:11] now I may run into problems I mentioned above with shifts on left size and leading zero in right side, so that would need to be adjusted
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:40:21] is that what you mean?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:40:40] sorry, communication, hard, enlish hard, compters, hard
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:41:38] [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0] 6 total bits, counting from the right there are two lower zeros
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:42:04] After you count the three bits from the right, you're looking for two zeroes and a one
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:42:18] Any zeroes before that are leading eroes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:42:29] ^zeroes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:42:52] There's probably some clever fast way of doing it though
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:44:06] ooh so you start from the right because then you can safely ignore any leading zeros
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:44:44] so you literally just count the number of 1, then draw a line and move on to the next section, and you start new section by ignoring any leading zeros
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:45:02] is that what you mean?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:45:18] After you hit the second section from the right you know the number of leading and trailing zeroes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:45:53] How do I know that?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:47:13]         [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:47:14] least significant 1 of 2nd ^   ^ 3 zeroes  ^ two trailing zeroes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:47:32] Leading zeroes = 3 - 2 trailing = 1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:48:05] ooh so after you count all 1 you need you keep going with zeros to find out the trailing zeros
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:48:27] I see I thought you start second section at 0, but you start it at 1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:49:09] Count all the 1s; from the right count trailing zeroes; count (total/3) 1s; count zeroes until next 1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:49:28] so just go through, count the 1s and 0s, that gives you the only possible configuration, then check if the binary values are equal, that's it?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:49:39] You shouldn't have to check
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:50:27] Actually, I suppose you can count the leading zeroes on the left
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:51:37] I don't see why I don't need to check after I walked through everything
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:52:48] Ah, right, it's possible that the values are not the same
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:54:03] If the number of bits isn't divisible by 3, that's an error too
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:54:06] ok, that's a doubly clever idea. I thought my idea was clever, but my idea was brute-force clever, this one is clever-clever
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:54:17] I don't think it's clever :|
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:54:59] I wouldn't have thought about counting ones. I went ahead and build a whole prefix with actual decimal values at each position etc
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:55:16] also no idea why my code doesn't work :(
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[19:55:28] GeDaMo: thanks for taking the time to help me :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:55:39] You don't have to do all the shifting either, once you have the start positions of the three segments, you can just compare them
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[19:56:10] Compare the list slices, that is
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[20:00:08] yes i think it is big endian but if you do it from the right then you wont have to deal with leading zeroes
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[20:00:28] just find the next leading one and then compare
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:00:52] Yeah got it, count leading zeros from the right, then count total_ones/3 of ones, then first next one, that position - leading_zeros is your right cut off line, repeat for the left cut off line. Once you have three slices combare decimal values. done
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:01:37] You don't need to convert to decimal
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[20:01:49] yes from the right its great because the zeroes already get nice and factored in
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:01:54] Unless that would be faster than just comparing the list slices
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[20:02:03] (tho if the problem used little endian then it would've been from the left)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:02:20] GeDaMo: oh right, true forgot those aren't actual bits
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:03:22] I'm not sure why it asks you to return two numbers when the question is really 'how big is each section?'
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:03:29] They'd all be the same size
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[20:04:48] i thought the sizes will be different if they had extra zeroes on the left
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:05:05] Can there be extra zeroes?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:05:17] I thought if it matched all the sections were the same
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:05:56] Well, that makes it a little more complex, not much though
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:07:18] GeDaMo: I think it doesn't have to be the same size, if you have many zeros on the right
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:07:32] Left
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:07:48] Left
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:08:15] left is most significant therefore leading zeros on the less are meaningless
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:08:32] Yeah
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:08:47] "leading" zeros on the right, are meaningful, they are more like bitshifts
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:09:01] well confusing comparisons, they are like zeros in 100
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:09:27] or zeros in 123000, those are meaningful zeros
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[20:09:33] digits on left can inform you of the type's hardware limitations
2021-07-18 05:12:19	GeDaMo	[20:10:01] Significant digits
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[20:10:12] yes this is why litte endian is superior
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:10:41] so least significant zeros are meaningful, because they are suffix
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:10:56] most significant zeros are meaningless because they are prefix and they don't affect decimal value
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[20:11:04] https://i.imgur.com/ld6hgMU.jpg
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[20:11:49] pulse: that is... funy and disturbing :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[20:11:54] :-)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:31] https://imgur.com/a/vC77k0h  Ok need a little advice... As you can see i have the spear grow out. Its just a point primitive with an increasing radius. What i want to do is make the  point markers appear as the points radius passes them.  What i need help with is figuring out how to check if the point is within the radius of that point. the coordinates of the markers are in XY in pixels
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:31] (+ the offset of the mini display frame) Any ideas?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:49] if you reply say my name so i get pinged :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[21:11:50] nice blinking lights
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:11:53] Mangy_Dog, what is that thing? looks awesome
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Mangy_Dog	[21:12:14] tricorder prop :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[21:12:27] yes this is the most impressive thing ive seen in a while
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:12:43] Mangy_Dog, and the solution to your problem is simply to measure distance from those points to your circle's center, and then compare that to the the current radius
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Mangy_Dog	[21:16:15] som eone gave me the forumlar also some one else showed me this https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-a-point-lies-inside-a-sphere-or-not/
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Mangy_Dog	[21:16:18] seems about right
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:17:16] wait, a sphere is 3D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	 *	pulse [21:17:33] raises eyebrow
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:18:01] and that looks very much 2D to me
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Mangy_Dog	[21:18:27] na 2d
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:19:28] if it's 2D you can just check if your current radius is within distance-delta, distance+delta
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:19:42] where distance is the distance between your expanding circle's center and the point of interest
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:20:02] and delta is some arbitrary number
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:20:12] used because typically these things aren't 100% precise
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:20:19] esp. if you're using floats
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:21:04] if it is, activate point (and make sure it doesn't activate again)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:28:27] it's the same problem with circle or sphere
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:28:55] actually if all you need is checking if the point is inside a circle it's then just radius > distance(P1,P2)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:29:05] or rather radius >= dist(P1,P2)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:29:15] P1 being center of the expanding circle
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:29:36] radius > euclidean_distance(center,P)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:29:47] :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:30:42] doesn't matter for circle, sphere or a multidimensional "rounded object" :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:31:03] yeah sphere is just one extra dimension
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:31:09] would be different for oval though
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:31:17] ellipse, you mean?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:31:28] yeah, that
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:31:30] that's a fun problem :)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:31:37] get's more annoying with 3D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:32:30] for circle it's trivial because the radius always represents the border
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:32:46] for oval you need a somewhat long equation
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:32:52] ellipse you have you use an INEQUATION
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:32:58] eh, i mean elipse
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:32:59] lol
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:33:07] ellipse*
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:33:43] you get the parametric equation of the ellipse and turn it into an inequation for the test point
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:33:54] hmm
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:34:05] quickly google it and you will see it
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:34:31] assuming you are familiar with inequations and parametric equations
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:35:01] that was barely covered by my primary school math classes, but I have a degree in engineering, so I had a REFRESH :D
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[21:35:28] calculus, linear algebra and everything else which comes in the math package for engineers
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pulse	[21:37:34] differential equations :p
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[21:38:38] cool, but not a big deal, just geometry stuff
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[21:39:32] the cool stuff is that if that's actually camera on a bigger plane he should use some kind of space indexing for the points so he doesn't check every single point every single frame
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[21:41:50] this projects looks like either a cool arcade game or a military project undercover of a cool arcade game
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:04:38] I do need to really refresh elementary math and study up to calculus. I had to look up what inequations were
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:05:59] What's the cleanest functional construct for converting a list(like) to a boolean that is true if all elements are equal? In Java's stream API the best I have come up with is .map(Optional::of).reduce((a,b)->a.equalTo(b)?a:empty()).get(), but this is clunky, and Java might or might not have something better, but what do more pure functional languages do?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:06:55] sorry. .isPresent(), not .get()
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:07:48] yeah that's hideous
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:08:50] why not just iterate the list?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:08:51] W: in js we have .some() and .every()
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:09:32] pyzozord, those sounds like they might take predicates on elements, not pair of elements?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:09:49] oh true
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:10:08] I mean, you can slice off the first element and compare the rest to it, but that seems clunky too
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:10:22] but you could do ar.every(el => el == ar[0])
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:10:54] you don't have to slice off an element, just compare with the next elem
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:10:54] check if each element is equal to first element will also confirm that all elements are equal
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:11:05] pyzozord, well, that'd work in the case of arrays
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:11:07] oh special case when count=1
2021-07-18 05:12:19	xsperry	[22:11:38] in a lazy functional language, like haskell, you can just call foldr (reduce) with && function:  allTrue = foldr (&&) True
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:11:50] xsperry, excellent, thanks
2021-07-18 05:12:19	xsperry	[22:12:13] it will stop once the first element is False
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:12:16] That was my real question, truly. Even if I can't find a Java equivalent to that, I know what to model a convenience function on
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:12:22] what if there are no elements
2021-07-18 05:12:19	edk	[22:12:23] xsperry: haven't you jsut implemented all?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:12:28] xsperry, oh, that's not what I asked for
2021-07-18 05:12:19	edk	[22:12:34] what if there are 0 elements or 1 elements?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	xsperry	[22:12:44] edk, it returns True (second argument of foldr)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	xsperry	[22:12:52] W, oh, sorry, I misread
2021-07-18 05:12:19	edk	[22:12:54] i'm asking about the function W wants
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:13:07] edk, both true
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:13:30] more accurately I guess I should say "returns false if there are two differing elements"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:14:06] (I mean true is fine too, a negation is not ugly here if the rest is elegant)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	davve_	[22:14:08] ideally you want to stop iterating then too
2021-07-18 05:12:19	davve_	[22:14:26] javascript has every and some for these occasions
2021-07-18 05:12:19	davve_	[22:14:31] quite handy actually
2021-07-18 05:12:19	davve_	[22:15:18] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:15:27] what specifically the Java solution gives you is parallelizability - not a hard requirement, but it's convenient when it's a pure reduce
2021-07-18 05:12:19	 *	W [22:19:10] looks for actual functional code that does this to draw from as example
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:22:55] seems like the common solution is a groupby
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:23:11] W does your java code handle empty list?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:24:18] lars8, sort of, I simplified it a bit. Reduce itself returns an optional, so it's even uglier than what I showed. The outer optional is empty if the stream is empty
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:25:33] (so you get e.g. Optional<Optional<ElementType>>)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:30:25] assuming you're not going for a one liner, this works: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/ZRSdUe2z
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:31:17] definition of and is what xsperry posted above, foldr (&&) True, so you can write it like that as well
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:32:07] so: allEqual (x:xs) = foldr (&&) True (map (==x) xs)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:32:28] writing out the type is optional, but it is allEqual :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[22:34:03] nice i like haskell
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:37:06] it looks a lot cleaner in Haskell than Java, that's for sure, but I kind of still don't like it. But thanks for providing what I asked after, regardless
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:39:14] I guess my code is blowing up the interpreter but I can't figure out why. Why Why Why???!!!  :)   Everything looks in order. At first I thought it was the paste site I was using but an other paste site (and locally) give the same result.  It looks like it's executing every control block without regard to the conditions.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[22:39:18] yes the foldr is the most natural approach it builds the value from the list
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[22:40:23] foldr the ultimate structure-preserving transformation
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:40:30] also, I guess there's a conflict of interest between parallelizability and short-circuiting on knowing the conclusion halfway through; at least if you want both, you would need a coordinating mechanism to cancel pending comparisons, which might just be more expensive than what you gain
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:42:24] indeed
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:43:35] W: you could do some chunking, having more "threads" than cpu threads would be counter productive anway, so it will be split up into 2..64 chunks, not that many chunks
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:45:37] if(condition) {...} else {...}  Is there any scenario in which both blcoks could be executed?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:45:47] pyzozord, I mean, the Java implementation does do that, just without any way to cancel if you have the answer after a chunk. It creates n*2 threads, iirc
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:46:15] blahboybaz, depends on language; e.g. one with goto or equivalent could do it
2021-07-18 05:12:19	WarauSalesman	[22:46:24] W: just use .allMatch()
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:46:31] I think pyzozord meant to split the list into chunks, then process each chunk on its own, in parallel
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:46:35] much more likely you just got the syntax wrong though, some nested if you missed
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:47:01] ideally, number of elements in a chunk would equal the number of CPU threads
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:47:07] lars8: yes that's what I meant, I had the impression that W understood that the same way as well
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:47:46] I meant n*2 where n=number of cores
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:48:04] W: Node (javascript).
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:48:10] blahboybaz, perhaps in the sense that a compiler might optimize the branch out if they both do exactly the same thing, also branch preditction will run both
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:48:22] lars8: I meant more of number of chunks equal to number of CPU threads to be honest. Then each cpu can do just a linear scan. The first one to find a missmatch needs to inform other threads they can stop
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:48:54] blahboybaz, then no, not that I can think of. Like I said, if it looks like it does, probably something else wrong and the code doesn't mean what you think it does
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[22:49:18] yes can you paste the rest of the code
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:49:30] This is what I have: https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5g9r9uk  - and -  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_nodejs_online.php
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:49:37] I can't figure it out
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:49:45] The code looks fine to me
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[22:50:01] pyzozord, that complicates the code though. and adds synchronization overhead.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:50:28] yeah that's true, insert a sync check ever 100 elements for example or so
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:50:38] I've made it way too complex
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:50:45] Ok it's time for me to go
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:51:10] W: I tried to hepl but I'm "punching up" here so sorry if I wasnt too helpful ;)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	pyzozord	[22:52:40] "punching up" in the sense of "trying to help someone more experience than me"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[22:53:16] I'm using Zig and am trying to read user input. What's the ideomatic way to handle an input that's bigger than my buffer (preferably without @panic)?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[22:53:54] Right now, I'm using an arena allocator and .alloc(u8, 100), but that can only accept 98-99 chars
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:53:55] usually line by line
2021-07-18 05:12:19	beaky	[22:54:13] blahboybaz: i think the +> in line 16 should be => but which part of the program's output seems incorrect?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Ox151	[22:54:33] hello, how can i remove commits from github, not local git
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[22:54:46] eyynet4: line by line? I'm only reading one line (simple rock-paper-scissors game)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	W	[22:54:58] It was an idle side thought anyway. I've decided on `.collect(groupingBy(identity())).size()<=1`, which is cleaner than what I had, and doesn't need to extract an element from the stream, or use foreach or an explicit loop or anything like that
2021-07-18 05:12:19	Ox151	[22:54:59] i have tried git reset --hard [hash] and then git push -f origin master but the push says everything is already up to date
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:55:23] so you would load one line into your buffer
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:55:32] and then discard it when done
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[22:55:50] I only have one line I need to read, though
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[22:56:34] And it feels wrong to panic on an input that's too long
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:56:55] only one round of RPS? blaphsemy!
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:57:15] someone always wants a "2 out of 3"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[22:57:20] I can call it in a loop, no problem there
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[22:58:39] I suppose I'll just truncate it at 99 chars and go from there
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:58:40] beaky: I saw that - it is not that way in the other places it was me making a change to try and see what was going on and making that mistake - you caught that in exactly the 15 seconds it was like that.
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:58:52] what are you truncating?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:58:53] With that corrected the problem I'be been dealing with is revealed
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:59:16] why is the input anywhere near 90 chars
2021-07-18 05:12:19	blahboybaz	[22:59:31] in the other paste site I mean - The prolem underlies that typo though
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[22:59:52] your maximum line length should be the buffer size
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[22:59:57] Right
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[23:01:43] Well that seems to work
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[23:01:47] if you're not seeing a newline then you will have to keep reading until you get to the new line
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[23:03:00] This is all my code, if that helps https://0x0.st/-V8j.zig\
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[23:03:18] ingore the trailing backslash (typo)
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[23:05:14] "readUntilDelimiterOrEof" but what about "end of buffer"  ?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	swl	[23:05:44] It'll throw a StreamTooLong if it doesn't fit
2021-07-18 05:12:19	lars8	[23:05:49] what language is that?
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[23:06:03] hopefully they are storing length in "var buf"
2021-07-18 05:12:19	eyynet4	[23:06:05] zig

2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:45:02] is that what you mean?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:45:18] After you hit the second section from the right you know the number of leading and trailing zeroes
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:45:53] How do I know that?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:47:13]         [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:47:14] least significant 1 of 2nd ^   ^ 3 zeroes  ^ two trailing zeroes
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:47:32] Leading zeroes = 3 - 2 trailing = 1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:48:05] ooh so after you count all 1 you need you keep going with zeros to find out the trailing zeros
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:48:27] I see I thought you start second section at 0, but you start it at 1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:49:09] Count all the 1s; from the right count trailing zeroes; count (total/3) 1s; count zeroes until next 1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:49:28] so just go through, count the 1s and 0s, that gives you the only possible configuration, then check if the binary values are equal, that's it?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:49:39] You shouldn't have to check
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:50:27] Actually, I suppose you can count the leading zeroes on the left
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:51:37] I don't see why I don't need to check after I walked through everything
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:52:48] Ah, right, it's possible that the values are not the same
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:54:03] If the number of bits isn't divisible by 3, that's an error too
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:54:06] ok, that's a doubly clever idea. I thought my idea was clever, but my idea was brute-force clever, this one is clever-clever
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:54:17] I don't think it's clever :|
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:54:59] I wouldn't have thought about counting ones. I went ahead and build a whole prefix with actual decimal values at each position etc
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:55:16] also no idea why my code doesn't work :(
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[19:55:28] GeDaMo: thanks for taking the time to help me :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:55:39] You don't have to do all the shifting either, once you have the start positions of the three segments, you can just compare them
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[19:56:10] Compare the list slices, that is
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[20:00:08] yes i think it is big endian but if you do it from the right then you wont have to deal with leading zeroes
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[20:00:28] just find the next leading one and then compare
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:00:52] Yeah got it, count leading zeros from the right, then count total_ones/3 of ones, then first next one, that position - leading_zeros is your right cut off line, repeat for the left cut off line. Once you have three slices combare decimal values. done
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:01:37] You don't need to convert to decimal
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[20:01:49] yes from the right its great because the zeroes already get nice and factored in
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:01:54] Unless that would be faster than just comparing the list slices
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[20:02:03] (tho if the problem used little endian then it would've been from the left)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:02:20] GeDaMo: oh right, true forgot those aren't actual bits
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:03:22] I'm not sure why it asks you to return two numbers when the question is really 'how big is each section?'
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:03:29] They'd all be the same size
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[20:04:48] i thought the sizes will be different if they had extra zeroes on the left
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:05:05] Can there be extra zeroes?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:05:17] I thought if it matched all the sections were the same
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:05:56] Well, that makes it a little more complex, not much though
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:07:18] GeDaMo: I think it doesn't have to be the same size, if you have many zeros on the right
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:07:32] Left
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:07:48] Left
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:08:15] left is most significant therefore leading zeros on the less are meaningless
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:08:32] Yeah
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:08:47] "leading" zeros on the right, are meaningful, they are more like bitshifts
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:09:01] well confusing comparisons, they are like zeros in 100
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:09:27] or zeros in 123000, those are meaningful zeros
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[20:09:33] digits on left can inform you of the type's hardware limitations
2021-07-18 16:36:23	GeDaMo	[20:10:01] Significant digits
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[20:10:12] yes this is why litte endian is superior
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:10:41] so least significant zeros are meaningful, because they are suffix
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:10:56] most significant zeros are meaningless because they are prefix and they don't affect decimal value

2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[20:11:49] pulse: that is... funy and disturbing :D
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[20:11:54] :-)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:31] https://imgur.com/a/vC77k0h  Ok need a little advice... As you can see i have the spear grow out. Its just a point primitive with an increasing radius. What i want to do is make the  point markers appear as the points radius passes them.  What i need help with is figuring out how to check if the point is within the radius of that point. the coordinates of the markers are in XY in pixels
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:31] (+ the offset of the mini display frame) Any ideas?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:49] if you reply say my name so i get pinged :D
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[21:11:50] nice blinking lights
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:11:53] Mangy_Dog, what is that thing? looks awesome
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Mangy_Dog	[21:12:14] tricorder prop :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[21:12:27] yes this is the most impressive thing ive seen in a while
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:12:43] Mangy_Dog, and the solution to your problem is simply to measure distance from those points to your circle's center, and then compare that to the the current radius
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Mangy_Dog	[21:16:15] som eone gave me the forumlar also some one else showed me this https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-a-point-lies-inside-a-sphere-or-not/
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Mangy_Dog	[21:16:18] seems about right
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:17:16] wait, a sphere is 3D
2021-07-18 16:36:23	 *	pulse [21:17:33] raises eyebrow
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:18:01] and that looks very much 2D to me
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Mangy_Dog	[21:18:27] na 2d
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:19:28] if it's 2D you can just check if your current radius is within distance-delta, distance+delta
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:19:42] where distance is the distance between your expanding circle's center and the point of interest
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:20:02] and delta is some arbitrary number
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:20:12] used because typically these things aren't 100% precise
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:20:19] esp. if you're using floats
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:21:04] if it is, activate point (and make sure it doesn't activate again)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:28:27] it's the same problem with circle or sphere
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:28:55] actually if all you need is checking if the point is inside a circle it's then just radius > distance(P1,P2)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:29:05] or rather radius >= dist(P1,P2)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:29:15] P1 being center of the expanding circle
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:29:36] radius > euclidean_distance(center,P)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:29:47] :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:30:42] doesn't matter for circle, sphere or a multidimensional "rounded object" :D
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:31:03] yeah sphere is just one extra dimension
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:31:09] would be different for oval though
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:31:17] ellipse, you mean?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:31:28] yeah, that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:31:30] that's a fun problem :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:31:37] get's more annoying with 3D
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:32:30] for circle it's trivial because the radius always represents the border
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:32:46] for oval you need a somewhat long equation
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:32:52] ellipse you have you use an INEQUATION
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:32:58] eh, i mean elipse
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:32:59] lol
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:33:07] ellipse*
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:33:43] you get the parametric equation of the ellipse and turn it into an inequation for the test point
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:33:54] hmm
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:34:05] quickly google it and you will see it
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:34:31] assuming you are familiar with inequations and parametric equations
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:35:01] that was barely covered by my primary school math classes, but I have a degree in engineering, so I had a REFRESH :D
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[21:35:28] calculus, linear algebra and everything else which comes in the math package for engineers
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pulse	[21:37:34] differential equations :p
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[21:38:38] cool, but not a big deal, just geometry stuff
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[21:39:32] the cool stuff is that if that's actually camera on a bigger plane he should use some kind of space indexing for the points so he doesn't check every single point every single frame
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[21:41:50] this projects looks like either a cool arcade game or a military project undercover of a cool arcade game
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:04:38] I do need to really refresh elementary math and study up to calculus. I had to look up what inequations were
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:05:59] What's the cleanest functional construct for converting a list(like) to a boolean that is true if all elements are equal? In Java's stream API the best I have come up with is .map(Optional::of).reduce((a,b)->a.equalTo(b)?a:empty()).get(), but this is clunky, and Java might or might not have something better, but what do more pure functional languages do?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:06:55] sorry. .isPresent(), not .get()
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:07:48] yeah that's hideous
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:08:50] why not just iterate the list?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:08:51] W: in js we have .some() and .every()
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:09:32] pyzozord, those sounds like they might take predicates on elements, not pair of elements?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:09:49] oh true
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:10:08] I mean, you can slice off the first element and compare the rest to it, but that seems clunky too
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:10:22] but you could do ar.every(el => el == ar[0])
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:10:54] you don't have to slice off an element, just compare with the next elem
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:10:54] check if each element is equal to first element will also confirm that all elements are equal
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:11:05] pyzozord, well, that'd work in the case of arrays
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:11:07] oh special case when count=1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	xsperry	[22:11:38] in a lazy functional language, like haskell, you can just call foldr (reduce) with && function:  allTrue = foldr (&&) True
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:11:50] xsperry, excellent, thanks
2021-07-18 16:36:23	xsperry	[22:12:13] it will stop once the first element is False
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:12:16] That was my real question, truly. Even if I can't find a Java equivalent to that, I know what to model a convenience function on
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:12:22] what if there are no elements
2021-07-18 16:36:23	edk	[22:12:23] xsperry: haven't you jsut implemented all?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:12:28] xsperry, oh, that's not what I asked for
2021-07-18 16:36:23	edk	[22:12:34] what if there are 0 elements or 1 elements?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	xsperry	[22:12:44] edk, it returns True (second argument of foldr)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	xsperry	[22:12:52] W, oh, sorry, I misread
2021-07-18 16:36:23	edk	[22:12:54] i'm asking about the function W wants
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:13:07] edk, both true
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:13:30] more accurately I guess I should say "returns false if there are two differing elements"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:14:06] (I mean true is fine too, a negation is not ugly here if the rest is elegant)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	davve_	[22:14:08] ideally you want to stop iterating then too
2021-07-18 16:36:23	davve_	[22:14:26] javascript has every and some for these occasions
2021-07-18 16:36:23	davve_	[22:14:31] quite handy actually
2021-07-18 16:36:23	davve_	[22:15:18] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:15:27] what specifically the Java solution gives you is parallelizability - not a hard requirement, but it's convenient when it's a pure reduce
2021-07-18 16:36:23	 *	W [22:19:10] looks for actual functional code that does this to draw from as example
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:22:55] seems like the common solution is a groupby
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:23:11] W does your java code handle empty list?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:24:18] lars8, sort of, I simplified it a bit. Reduce itself returns an optional, so it's even uglier than what I showed. The outer optional is empty if the stream is empty
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:25:33] (so you get e.g. Optional<Optional<ElementType>>)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:30:25] assuming you're not going for a one liner, this works: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/ZRSdUe2z
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:31:17] definition of and is what xsperry posted above, foldr (&&) True, so you can write it like that as well
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:32:07] so: allEqual (x:xs) = foldr (&&) True (map (==x) xs)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:32:28] writing out the type is optional, but it is allEqual :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[22:34:03] nice i like haskell
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:37:06] it looks a lot cleaner in Haskell than Java, that's for sure, but I kind of still don't like it. But thanks for providing what I asked after, regardless
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:39:14] I guess my code is blowing up the interpreter but I can't figure out why. Why Why Why???!!!  :)   Everything looks in order. At first I thought it was the paste site I was using but an other paste site (and locally) give the same result.  It looks like it's executing every control block without regard to the conditions.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[22:39:18] yes the foldr is the most natural approach it builds the value from the list
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[22:40:23] foldr the ultimate structure-preserving transformation
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:40:30] also, I guess there's a conflict of interest between parallelizability and short-circuiting on knowing the conclusion halfway through; at least if you want both, you would need a coordinating mechanism to cancel pending comparisons, which might just be more expensive than what you gain
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:42:24] indeed
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:43:35] W: you could do some chunking, having more "threads" than cpu threads would be counter productive anway, so it will be split up into 2..64 chunks, not that many chunks
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:45:37] if(condition) {...} else {...}  Is there any scenario in which both blcoks could be executed?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:45:47] pyzozord, I mean, the Java implementation does do that, just without any way to cancel if you have the answer after a chunk. It creates n*2 threads, iirc
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:46:15] blahboybaz, depends on language; e.g. one with goto or equivalent could do it
2021-07-18 16:36:23	WarauSalesman	[22:46:24] W: just use .allMatch()
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:46:31] I think pyzozord meant to split the list into chunks, then process each chunk on its own, in parallel
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:46:35] much more likely you just got the syntax wrong though, some nested if you missed
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:47:01] ideally, number of elements in a chunk would equal the number of CPU threads
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:47:07] lars8: yes that's what I meant, I had the impression that W understood that the same way as well
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:47:46] I meant n*2 where n=number of cores
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:48:04] W: Node (javascript).
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:48:10] blahboybaz, perhaps in the sense that a compiler might optimize the branch out if they both do exactly the same thing, also branch preditction will run both
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:48:22] lars8: I meant more of number of chunks equal to number of CPU threads to be honest. Then each cpu can do just a linear scan. The first one to find a missmatch needs to inform other threads they can stop
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:48:54] blahboybaz, then no, not that I can think of. Like I said, if it looks like it does, probably something else wrong and the code doesn't mean what you think it does
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[22:49:18] yes can you paste the rest of the code
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:49:30] This is what I have: https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5g9r9uk  - and -  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_nodejs_online.php
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:49:37] I can't figure it out
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:49:45] The code looks fine to me
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[22:50:01] pyzozord, that complicates the code though. and adds synchronization overhead.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:50:28] yeah that's true, insert a sync check ever 100 elements for example or so
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:50:38] I've made it way too complex
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:50:45] Ok it's time for me to go
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:51:10] W: I tried to hepl but I'm "punching up" here so sorry if I wasnt too helpful ;)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pyzozord	[22:52:40] "punching up" in the sense of "trying to help someone more experience than me"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[22:53:16] I'm using Zig and am trying to read user input. What's the ideomatic way to handle an input that's bigger than my buffer (preferably without @panic)?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[22:53:54] Right now, I'm using an arena allocator and .alloc(u8, 100), but that can only accept 98-99 chars
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:53:55] usually line by line
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[22:54:13] blahboybaz: i think the +> in line 16 should be => but which part of the program's output seems incorrect?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Ox151	[22:54:33] hello, how can i remove commits from github, not local git
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[22:54:46] eyynet4: line by line? I'm only reading one line (simple rock-paper-scissors game)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	W	[22:54:58] It was an idle side thought anyway. I've decided on `.collect(groupingBy(identity())).size()<=1`, which is cleaner than what I had, and doesn't need to extract an element from the stream, or use foreach or an explicit loop or anything like that
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Ox151	[22:54:59] i have tried git reset --hard [hash] and then git push -f origin master but the push says everything is already up to date
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:55:23] so you would load one line into your buffer
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:55:32] and then discard it when done
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[22:55:50] I only have one line I need to read, though
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[22:56:34] And it feels wrong to panic on an input that's too long
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:56:55] only one round of RPS? blaphsemy!
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:57:15] someone always wants a "2 out of 3"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[22:57:20] I can call it in a loop, no problem there
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[22:58:39] I suppose I'll just truncate it at 99 chars and go from there
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:58:40] beaky: I saw that - it is not that way in the other places it was me making a change to try and see what was going on and making that mistake - you caught that in exactly the 15 seconds it was like that.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:58:52] what are you truncating?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:58:53] With that corrected the problem I'be been dealing with is revealed
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:59:16] why is the input anywhere near 90 chars
2021-07-18 16:36:23	blahboybaz	[22:59:31] in the other paste site I mean - The prolem underlies that typo though
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[22:59:52] your maximum line length should be the buffer size
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[22:59:57] Right
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[23:01:43] Well that seems to work
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[23:01:47] if you're not seeing a newline then you will have to keep reading until you get to the new line
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[23:03:00] This is all my code, if that helps https://0x0.st/-V8j.zig\
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[23:03:18] ingore the trailing backslash (typo)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[23:05:14] "readUntilDelimiterOrEof" but what about "end of buffer"  ?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	swl	[23:05:44] It'll throw a StreamTooLong if it doesn't fit
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[23:05:49] what language is that?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[23:06:03] hopefully they are storing length in "var buf"
2021-07-18 16:36:23	eyynet4	[23:06:05] zig

2021-07-18 16:36:23	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:41:15]  there is a github repo url used with api.github.com, I need to search and download a particular version and platform build of that software, how can I do that?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:41:25] I tried with wget
2021-07-18 16:36:23	InPhase	[03:42:03] wget is reasonable if you know exactly what to grab.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	InPhase	[03:42:27] If you need to parse data and then make a decision about what to grab, abandon bash immediately, and write this in Python.

2021-07-18 16:36:23	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:42:43] https://api.github.com/repos/VSCodium/vscodium/releases/latest
2021-07-18 16:36:23	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:43:23] from this site I want to install amd64 version for ubuntu
2021-07-18 16:36:23	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:43:33] sry download
2021-07-18 16:36:23	InPhase	[03:49:57] guy_frm_yogaland: Here's a starter hint.  Clean it up of course:  d = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen('https://api.github.com/repos/VSCodium/vscodium/releases/latest').read());  L = [d['assets'][i]['browser_download_url'] for i in range(len(d['assets']))]
2021-07-18 16:36:23	InPhase	[03:50:14] guy_frm_yogaland: Needs import json and import urllib
2021-07-18 16:36:23	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:50:24] ok, let me try it
2021-07-18 16:36:23	InPhase	[03:51:56] guy_frm_yogaland: A second filtering list comprehension, and you'll have the amd64 url.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	InPhase	[03:52:32] Then you decide if you want to move the whole thing into Python, or just farm out this url extracting portion and do the primary in bash.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:52:54] ok
2021-07-18 16:36:23	sunny93	[04:13:31] What's definition of "procedure call"?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Izem	[04:20:31] invoking a subroutine?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:24:13] hello what is the most efficient way to implement an array in a purely functional programming language
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Izem	[04:25:23] depends on the language
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:25:25] inefficient ways are like using a list and using lambda encoding of a map
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Izem	[04:25:57] does any give you memory access? :P
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:26:05] what is memory access
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Izem	[04:26:40] like allocating memory
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:26:46] memory access is cheating because the memory is like a primitive kind of array
2021-07-18 16:36:23	jeaye	[04:27:48] beaky: https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1
2021-07-18 16:36:23	jeaye	[04:28:09] "in a purely ..." or "for a purely ..."
2021-07-18 16:36:23	jeaye	[04:28:30] I can see how someone might say the first and want the second.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	jeaye	[04:28:38] If so, that link is a good place to start.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:29:10] nice i think clojures vectors are a good approach
2021-07-18 16:36:23	lars8	[04:31:34] a bit more than you asked for, but.. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221241312_Regular_Shape-polymorphic_Parallel_Arrays_in_Haskell
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:31:38] the copy-on-write tree approach
2021-07-18 16:36:23	pikapika	[04:32:35] beaky, hi
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:33:00] hello im beaky
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:34:01] nice i like the repa approach though i think its also cheating by using ghc primitive unboxed array types
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:35:33] whereas the clojure vector approach in theory does not rely on primitive unboxed arrays i think
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[04:54:57] beaky, It seems to me like asking for the most efficient way to implement an integer. It should really be a primitive, otherwise you're stuck emulating it with church encoding or in the array case, a very large product types, or worse, a tree.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[04:56:17] beaky, Does your pure functional language allows controlled mutation (maybe an effect system or similar)?
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:56:52] yes i think trees are the worst case (its how integers are implemented in coq)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:57:47] tho coq very recently now has primitive arrays
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:57:59] (but not primitive ints lol)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[04:58:42] no effects in coq its hardcore
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[04:59:18] Without effects, the only way to modify an immutable value is by creating a new one, which means O(n) for every modification of an element of an array. Technically you could amortize the cost and collect the changes into some sort of "diff list", but then you're just piling diff lists onto diff lists, until it degenerates to O(n^2).
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:01:03] For immutable trees it's nicer. You can get to O(log n) where you're creating newer nodes when a leaf changes.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:01:21] I guess the key can be the array index, so there you go, O(log n) arrays.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[05:01:46] yes that is how they implemented arrays for compcert
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[05:02:12] indexed by positive binary numbers
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:02:34] I don't think you can get anything better for a pure language without effects.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[05:04:18] i think the clojure vector approach is more efficient but the one they used is probably easier to prove things about https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert/blob/04f499c632a76e460560fc9ec4e14d8216e7fc18/lib/Maps.v#L184
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:04:19] I worked myself in a corner like that years ago in Haskell and ended up inventing what Rust calls today "interior mutability", but that was only possible because Haskell had unsafePerformIO as an escape hatch.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[05:04:41] nice i like rust
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:04:59] That's why I bring it up :)
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:06:09] You need effects though, otherwise you're stuck with the logarithmic mutations.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[05:06:41] how does hardware get away with not being logarithmic
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:07:35] Because it gets rid of the unnecessary restrictive abstraction that was added.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[05:09:58] but even in hardware isn't there like a logarithmic (but constant since the width is fixed) propagation delay
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:13:03] Language semantics don't usually have "propagation delay" to worry about, until you're doing functional reactive programming, then you could cause what they call a "glitch".
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[05:13:50] nice i gotta try functoal reactive programming someday
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:17:33] Todays hardware allows random access (RAM as opposed to tapes) and mutation (as opposed to ROM). Both took a lot of time and engineering to make them fast (caches), safe (virtual memory) and durable (ecc).
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:18:05] The language you're describing to me, pure, functional, effect-free and without arrays, seems like it's going backwards on all of those things.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[05:20:50] yes what if we could come up with the vulkan of modern machines
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:25:07] I don't think tea databases care that much.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	nitrix	[05:25:44] It would be a good way to keep a bunch of bored engineers busy though.
2021-07-18 16:36:23	beaky	[06:01:25] how to write a tsdb (time-series database, not tea storage database unfortunately) from scratch the trick is to use sick sequential writes for maximum performance https://nakabonne.dev/posts/write-tsdb-from-scratch/
2021-07-18 16:36:23	Guest9	[06:54:24] i am looking for ways how to achieve this functionality: I have list of labels-A &  labels-B. I want user to pick=select & drag labels from B & drop in between two sub-sequent labels-of-A.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[06:55:54] in web-app
2021-07-18 16:36:24	PlanckWalk	[06:57:33] Sounds like handling drag and drop events in javascript
2021-07-18 16:36:24	PlanckWalk	[06:59:25] There are quite a few options for how to do that based on how you want to UI to behave
2021-07-18 16:36:24	PlanckWalk	[06:59:59] E.g. do you want list A to "make room" for the B item while still in progress?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	PlanckWalk	[07:00:27] Are you allowing consecutive B items within list A, or must they always have an A item before and after?  These sorts of questions.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	PlanckWalk	[07:02:03] If you do have behaviour distinctions between A and B items in list A, then you probably want an appearance distinction between them.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:10:16] https://aggie.io/wuhaym2e17
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:10:25] PlanckWalk i have rough sketch here
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:10:29] how i want
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:10:40] drag and drop action is shown by different color
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:11:10] any lable from B can be dropped 0 or more times in between labels of A
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:12:35] yes, room =space is required dynamically when label B is dropped in between label A
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:13:19] is it clear enough?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[07:14:27] Wouldn't standard GUI widgits support that already?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	PlanckWalk	[07:15:04] Depends which frameworks you're using
2021-07-18 16:36:24	PlanckWalk	[07:15:21] (And whether the assumptions made by the standard widgets match what you in particular need)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:22:02] i cant find drag and drop kind of stuff on anvil components UI
2021-07-18 16:36:24	Guest9	[07:23:10] https://anvil.works/docs/overview
2021-07-18 16:36:24	nitrix	[07:48:46] Unpopular opinion, I prefered when websites were just HTML, CSS, templates and some jQuery.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[07:50:02] I preferred when websites were just HTML :P
2021-07-18 16:36:24	nitrix	[07:50:11] It wasn't always pretty but at least people knew how to build things with it.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	psydroid [07:50:38] prefers when Gemini sites are just Gemdocs
2021-07-18 16:36:24	xeno	[07:51:52] nitrix: in some ways I did too - not because it was good in any way (it wasn't), but because the future looked brighter than what it turned out to be
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[07:53:11] hello the lambda cube is a structure that lets us visualize various generalizations of the lambda calculus. there is the untyped lambda calculus (lisp), various typed lambda calculi with different generalizations like type abstraction or higher kinded types (haskell) or dependent types (LF), with the most general one being the calculus of constructions (coq)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[07:53:13] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube but what programming language do the other corners of hte cube correspond to like λP2 or System Fω ?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	nitrix	[07:57:50] xeno, If you've ever observed how a carpenter works, it's a handful of tools, measure twice, cut once, chisel until perfection. Very laborious, but they get into that flow state doing the motions relentlessly until the impeccable final result.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	nitrix	[07:59:22] xeno, Some languages and libraries let me get that flow state where I'm just given the tools, the raw materials and I work the rest, while others are trying to be insanely complicated all-in-one machinery that you have to turn the right knobs, press the right buttons, but then it does it all for you.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	nitrix	[08:00:06] I much prefer the artisanal approach :/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	xeno	[08:00:31] nitrix: well, HTML is just a fail design, javascript was a failed design, the browser stack a horrible design, and jQuery was a horrible patchwork to make it somewhat usable
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:01:06] yes what if instead we had alan kay's dream of the ultimate application vm environment
2021-07-18 16:36:24	xeno	[08:01:07] I agree that I prefer simple and good tools, but those tools weren't good. It was doing carpetry with a failed prototype for a swiss pocket knife
2021-07-18 16:36:24	nitrix	[08:01:56] beaky, Kind like wasm?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:03:50] I feel like wasm is just shovelling more shit on top of the pile we already have
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:03:50] unlike wasm more like if the web was smalltalk
2021-07-18 16:36:24	xeno	[08:04:18] GeDaMo: it could have been good, but they seem to aim for that yes :/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	arahael	[08:04:35] I preferred it when websites were smaller than a compressed copy of the original DOOM.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:04:42] (instead of having apps being shoehrond into the web and its document model)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	smallville7123	[08:07:02] how do i tile render vertex and index data?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:08:19] I recognise all of those words :|
2021-07-18 16:36:24	smallville7123	[08:08:39] haha
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:09:09] yes more like alan kay's croquet project https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquet_Project
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:11:01] the future of programming
2021-07-18 16:36:24	vdamewood	[08:13:30] arahael: No doubt they were more accessible when they were little more than rich-text documents.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	arahael	[08:13:40] vdamewood: Indeed.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	vdamewood	[08:14:25] arahael: Now, click on the pictures of homicidal dolls to prove you're not a robot.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	arahael	[08:14:46] vdamewood: Ah, yep.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:14:48] whereas something like wasm provides for like islands of applications, alan kay's vm idea thing is for providing a truly distributed and collaborative software environment
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	arahael [08:14:53] taps on the traffic lights.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	vdamewood	[08:15:13] arahael: That proves you'rre not a robot. Robots follow directions.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:17:14] alan kay's vm was also like a distributed database operating on a 'teatime' protocol for updates
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:17:33] a tea-oriented database
2021-07-18 16:36:24	vdamewood	[08:18:01] beaky: You should make a tea-oriented programming languag, where everything is a tea.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:18:38] yes i must revive alan kay's tea protocol
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	vdamewood [08:18:52] hands beaky an error 418.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:19:00] formalize it in coq and implement it in my tea database
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:19:15] it will be the synchronization primitive
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:19:51] but which part of the lambda cube will it sit on
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:21:38] plus they could have gemini in it
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:21:41] Can it be in the middle? :P
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:21:46] lol
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:22:14] yes it will have not-quite dependent types like how in c++ templates are not-quite generics
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:22:38] and sorta-higher kinded types but i dont know what that would look like
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:23:05] invented as philip wadler would say
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:23:34] Lambda hypercube! :P
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:24:21] yes with cubical type theory i think they will have to update the lambda cube thing to support hypercubes
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:26:35] because now there are more primitives like 'intervals' and 'path types' (which are not types proper i think)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:27:13] the higher dimensions will be when you have types that have those
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:31:26] very interesting discussion
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	vdamewood [08:31:46] pats pyzozord on the head.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:32:18] damn it I've put myself in so much opportunities to learn that I can't keep up and I'm not sure which one to chase
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:33:34] regarding the truly distributed vm, the etherum vm is like that, that's why I was interested in it for a while
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:34:02] but it's just too tied up with the mon(k)ey business
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:37:01] There was a notion a while back about mobile agents: code that you would send out to collect data for you
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:37:15] I suppose we have that with JS in browsers :|
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:37:17] yes alan kay's dream was like to have that distributed vm, but instead of being oriented towards currency or digital ownership (which i think ethereum is about) was more about douglas englebart style 'augmenting human intellect' things to make collaborative computing possible and accessible
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:37:37] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_agent
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:38:27] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_mobility
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:38:44] nice the dream would be for me to have mobile agents to handle database things on the go
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:42:15] So viruses are mobile agents? Is an agent that replicates itself to a new host without leaving the old host mobile as well, or does it have to be strictly in one place at one time?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:43:38] yes like viruses but more general purpose i think
2021-07-18 16:36:24	beaky	[08:44:08] the original vision for the cloud
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:44:29] oh it's a very interesting concept with code mobility, programs tend to be infinitly smaller than the data sets. Have programs move around, kind of "dock" to a data store, do it's job and move on. While freaking ship tons of data to each small program
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:45:00] s/While/Why/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:45:44] Meanwhile: all the data has to be transferred from memory to the CPU to be processed :P
2021-07-18 16:36:24	psydroid	[08:46:32] the real cloud will come into existence when the pseudocloud has been exposed for the impostor it is
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:46:46] that could be it, maybe the path forward is cpus with build in memory banks and cpu/ram chips as single units
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:47:55] You're still going to have to move a lot of data about
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:48:31] Even something as simple as an add takes two parameters, can you guarantee they're both going to be in the same memory shard?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:49:04] yeah I suppose that's true. Same on the macro level, what if I want to corelate covid data with say weather data
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:52:26] Good morning.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:52:42] Hi mrig :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:52:49] Hello GeDaMo :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:52:50] pyzozord: did you get your bit list thing working?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:53:27] Ah well at least if I go into the dev settings and turn off JS then anything written on medium.com does not run my batteries down :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:54:04] Perhaps there is a simple switch in the browser apps that does this so that I dont need to rummage in the settings.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:54:16] GeDaMo: no I tried the algorithm you suggested but it failes for [0,0,0,0,0]. My version returns [4,5] but expected is [1,4]. I'm having another stab at this in a moment
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[08:54:36] Ah, I hadn't considered all zeroes :/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:54:37] GeDaMo: not the algorithm fails, I think my implementation does
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:55:10] I am starting to consider making a database erp type app with html now, that must mean that something is sinking in I suppose :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:55:24] html being the interface I mean.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:56:26] I'd like to write a teminal module that makes it simple to plug in either to an html browser or a terminal, would be great to do gemini too.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:56:38] mrig: I recommend uBlock Origin with setting to turn of all scripts, images above 50kb and fonts by default and only whitelist the sites you like
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:57:04] yes I use that amongst others, the defaults are generally pretty good.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:57:09] mrig: works very well, annyoing thing is that just browsing web and visitng links people share is kind of impaired
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:57:43] Yes, I have to slowly allow things until which ever site it is that I'm trying to explore starts to work.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:57:54] It's a pain in the ass.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:58:18] But still there is good info on the web and it is an amazing thing.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:58:26] I started judging sites by how well they work without js/fonts/big images
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:58:38] I have to say, some sites are just white backgrounds...
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:58:55] I've high hopes for some sort of AI filter that just removes all the cruft for me.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[08:59:10] huh, cool idea
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:59:17] That would be great. The antipathy of the targeted add.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	furrymcgee	[08:59:29] a text based browser will do
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:59:39] yes it does for most things
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[08:59:51] would be nice to be able to interact with a database too though.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[09:00:08] I also use the adblocker for removing cosmetic things which annoy me
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:00:22] That said, this could be the point in the timeline where it all started to get messy :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:01:34] automated targeted JS removal, prune your search results list and send your results to some massive blacklist database of offenisve JS use.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[09:02:15] I wondered if something like baysian filtering used for email would work on website elements
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:02:40] Within search results?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	mrig [09:02:54] scurries off to look up baysian filtering
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[09:03:40] It's used for email spam filters
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[09:04:07] I downloaded a book on it which I haven't read :/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:04:16] Oh that looks really interesting, some sort of accumulation of data feeding a vector of 'respectability'
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:05:02] Oh books are read at the right time, I have to wait for them to call me when I'm ready to read them; Nothing goes in otherwise.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:06:25] oh yes Bayesian Statistics, right yes I've come across this before, it is interesting stuff.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[09:06:32] https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[09:06:49] Ah, there's a new version
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:07:00] proofs that Newtonian scientists hate to accept.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:07:30] oh that looks great
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:08:14] I'm still working on my basic algebra and calculus at the moment, bet this will be useful eventually though.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:09:57] Oh I did come across what was to my mind the best advertising on the web that I've ever seen.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:10:10] I actually sat and watched the add :D
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mercenary	[09:10:10] The trick is to get the bayesian/AI filter to run in smaller battery envelope than the filtered cruft
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:10:59] mercenary: right yes, you dont want to be burning up fuel to stop the monster, cache and blacklist would sort that though.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:11:42] so long as you dont end up needing servers the size of a google farm to store the list of cruft.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:12:57] https://youtu.be/RFLqlHFoI3M?t=410 <- watchable advert warning.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	mrig	[09:13:17] no objection to stuff that is as clever as that.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[09:50:06] GeDaMo: I short circuted the zeros with early return. The code is very messy, but we got 100% faster thanb all other submissions on leetcode :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[09:50:40] here is my code if you are curious, extremly ugly https://ideone.com/E3ocyQ
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[09:51:43] the part with comparing the three parts actually have me a lot of trouble, first you need to get rid of the leading zeros, then it's a threeway comparison
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[09:52:23] and we are 100% even though I do extra dumb stuff like arr.slice uncessarily really
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[09:52:33] :)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[09:54:41] https://imgur.com/a/UDZOfIP
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[09:55:52] now I need to study my original brute-force clever idea and see if that was also failure at executing the idea or if the idea is flawed
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[09:57:03] also fresh mind makes all the difference in these kinds of problems
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[09:58:01] Nobody else managed to solve that? :|
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[09:58:28] no, it's just our solution is the in the 100% percentail of the fastest js solutions
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pikapika	[10:00:56] pyzozord, hi

2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[10:06:56] Test is the name of the object and __main__ is the current module(?)

2021-07-18 16:36:24	snake	[10:31:54] anyone know how i can repeat a page load in firefox with ipv4
2021-07-18 16:36:24	snake	[10:32:10] with curl you can do -4 or -6 to choose which ip protocol to use, but i dont see that option in firefox
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[10:32:48] Could you use the ipv4 address instead of the domain name?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	snake	[10:33:52] GeDaMo, it says direct ip access is not allowed on cloudfare
2021-07-18 16:36:24	snake	[10:33:56] good idea though
2021-07-18 16:36:24	snake	[10:34:05] this is the site http://ifconfig.co/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	menace	[10:40:55] is there also some tool when i want to reach a certain ip through which ASNs it is routed? would be interesting :D
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[10:41:53] You mean like traceroute?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[10:43:49] Or mtr
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:46:23] how much gb or ram do I need to run a couple of discord bots, a website and znc?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	smallville7123	[10:47:22] CuriousErnestBro: probably much less than 1 gb
2021-07-18 16:36:24	dodo	[10:47:48] depends. is your website facebook?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	smallville7123	[10:47:54] dodo: XD
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:48:00] just a personal blog
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:48:27] I'm gonna experiment with jekyll
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pulse	[10:50:01] careful not to let it turn into mr. hyde
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[10:50:06] CuriousErnestBro: you _should_ be able to fit in 256mb or less, but depending on your software choices you might even need 2GB :P
2021-07-18 16:36:24	pyzozord	[10:50:31] frankly this should be doable in 1mb
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:50:43] actually I plan on using R with the bookdown package
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:50:50] https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:53:04] sigh... most of my time is spent learning infra instead of programming
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:53:08] is this what life is in 2021?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:53:49] I'm not really complaining, I find it interesting
2021-07-18 16:36:24	GeDaMo	[10:54:04] "infra"?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:55:50] yeah, now I want to learn how to create a website locally, and on push that it gets updated automatically
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:55:56] so I'll be reading up on github actions this afternoon
2021-07-18 16:36:24	arahael	[10:56:07] CuriousErnestBro: I just push from my local machine when I make changes.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	arahael	[10:56:33] CuriousErnestBro: I wrote a simple static site generator that 1) Generates the website, and 2) Pushes automatically, and 3) Updates the CDN.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:57:13] what do you mean by "Pushes automatically", is it a bash script that uses rsync or scp or something?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	 *	CuriousErnestBro [10:57:31] uses "push" exclusively in git(hub) contexts
2021-07-18 16:36:24	arahael	[10:58:49] CuriousErnestBro: It's a script, yes, and since my static website is in AWS S3, it use the AWS S3 api.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:59:26] what do you mean, your website is in aws s3? I thought s3 didn't do hosting and you'd have to use lightsail or ec2
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[10:59:55] as far as I understand, s3 is "object storage" (idk what objects are in this context btw)
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[11:00:38] arahael or is your website served through a "lambda"?
2021-07-18 16:36:24	arahael	[11:01:01] CuriousErnestBro: S3 can also serve static websites.
2021-07-18 16:36:24	CuriousErnestBro	[11:01:26] interesting...

2021-07-18 16:46:55	GeDaMo	Looks like it uses JS for some highlighting but it's not really noticeable without it
2021-07-18 16:47:23	CuriousErnestBro	yeah I use fira code wherever I can't use Menlo
2021-07-18 16:47:32	CuriousErnestBro	to be honest, all code fonts look the same to me
2021-07-18 16:48:04	CuriousErnestBro	GeDaMo I think it uses mathjax.js for the LaTeX rendering

2021-07-18 20:21:09	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:31] https://imgur.com/a/vC77k0h  Ok need a little advice... As you can see i have the spear grow out. Its just a point primitive with an increasing radius. What i want to do is make the  point markers appear as the points radius passes them.  What i need help with is figuring out how to check if the point is within the radius of that point. the coordinates of the markers are in XY in pixels
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:31] (+ the offset of the mini display frame) Any ideas?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Mangy_Dog	[21:06:49] if you reply say my name so i get pinged :D
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[21:11:50] nice blinking lights
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:11:53] Mangy_Dog, what is that thing? looks awesome
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Mangy_Dog	[21:12:14] tricorder prop :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[21:12:27] yes this is the most impressive thing ive seen in a while
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:12:43] Mangy_Dog, and the solution to your problem is simply to measure distance from those points to your circle's center, and then compare that to the the current radius
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Mangy_Dog	[21:16:15] som eone gave me the forumlar also some one else showed me this https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-a-point-lies-inside-a-sphere-or-not/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Mangy_Dog	[21:16:18] seems about right
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:17:16] wait, a sphere is 3D
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	pulse [21:17:33] raises eyebrow
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:18:01] and that looks very much 2D to me
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Mangy_Dog	[21:18:27] na 2d
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:19:28] if it's 2D you can just check if your current radius is within distance-delta, distance+delta
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:19:42] where distance is the distance between your expanding circle's center and the point of interest
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:20:02] and delta is some arbitrary number
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:20:12] used because typically these things aren't 100% precise
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:20:19] esp. if you're using floats
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:21:04] if it is, activate point (and make sure it doesn't activate again)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:28:27] it's the same problem with circle or sphere
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:28:55] actually if all you need is checking if the point is inside a circle it's then just radius > distance(P1,P2)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:29:05] or rather radius >= dist(P1,P2)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:29:15] P1 being center of the expanding circle
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:29:36] radius > euclidean_distance(center,P)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:29:47] :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:30:42] doesn't matter for circle, sphere or a multidimensional "rounded object" :D
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:31:03] yeah sphere is just one extra dimension
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:31:09] would be different for oval though
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:31:17] ellipse, you mean?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:31:28] yeah, that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:31:30] that's a fun problem :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:31:37] get's more annoying with 3D
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:32:30] for circle it's trivial because the radius always represents the border
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:32:46] for oval you need a somewhat long equation
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:32:52] ellipse you have you use an INEQUATION
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:32:58] eh, i mean elipse
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:32:59] lol
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:33:07] ellipse*
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:33:43] you get the parametric equation of the ellipse and turn it into an inequation for the test point
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:33:54] hmm
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:34:05] quickly google it and you will see it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:34:31] assuming you are familiar with inequations and parametric equations
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:35:01] that was barely covered by my primary school math classes, but I have a degree in engineering, so I had a REFRESH :D
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[21:35:28] calculus, linear algebra and everything else which comes in the math package for engineers
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[21:37:34] differential equations :p
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[21:38:38] cool, but not a big deal, just geometry stuff
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[21:39:32] the cool stuff is that if that's actually camera on a bigger plane he should use some kind of space indexing for the points so he doesn't check every single point every single frame
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[21:41:50] this projects looks like either a cool arcade game or a military project undercover of a cool arcade game
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:04:38] I do need to really refresh elementary math and study up to calculus. I had to look up what inequations were
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:05:59] What's the cleanest functional construct for converting a list(like) to a boolean that is true if all elements are equal? In Java's stream API the best I have come up with is .map(Optional::of).reduce((a,b)->a.equalTo(b)?a:empty()).get(), but this is clunky, and Java might or might not have something better, but what do more pure functional languages do?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:06:55] sorry. .isPresent(), not .get()
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:07:48] yeah that's hideous
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:08:50] why not just iterate the list?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:08:51] W: in js we have .some() and .every()
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:09:32] pyzozord, those sounds like they might take predicates on elements, not pair of elements?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:09:49] oh true
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:10:08] I mean, you can slice off the first element and compare the rest to it, but that seems clunky too
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:10:22] but you could do ar.every(el => el == ar[0])
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:10:54] you don't have to slice off an element, just compare with the next elem
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:10:54] check if each element is equal to first element will also confirm that all elements are equal
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:11:05] pyzozord, well, that'd work in the case of arrays
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:11:07] oh special case when count=1
2021-07-18 20:21:09	xsperry	[22:11:38] in a lazy functional language, like haskell, you can just call foldr (reduce) with && function:  allTrue = foldr (&&) True
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:11:50] xsperry, excellent, thanks
2021-07-18 20:21:09	xsperry	[22:12:13] it will stop once the first element is False
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:12:16] That was my real question, truly. Even if I can't find a Java equivalent to that, I know what to model a convenience function on
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:12:22] what if there are no elements
2021-07-18 20:21:09	edk	[22:12:23] xsperry: haven't you jsut implemented all?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:12:28] xsperry, oh, that's not what I asked for
2021-07-18 20:21:09	edk	[22:12:34] what if there are 0 elements or 1 elements?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	xsperry	[22:12:44] edk, it returns True (second argument of foldr)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	xsperry	[22:12:52] W, oh, sorry, I misread
2021-07-18 20:21:09	edk	[22:12:54] i'm asking about the function W wants
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:13:07] edk, both true
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:13:30] more accurately I guess I should say "returns false if there are two differing elements"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:14:06] (I mean true is fine too, a negation is not ugly here if the rest is elegant)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	davve_	[22:14:08] ideally you want to stop iterating then too
2021-07-18 20:21:09	davve_	[22:14:26] javascript has every and some for these occasions
2021-07-18 20:21:09	davve_	[22:14:31] quite handy actually
2021-07-18 20:21:09	davve_	[22:15:18] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:15:27] what specifically the Java solution gives you is parallelizability - not a hard requirement, but it's convenient when it's a pure reduce
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	W [22:19:10] looks for actual functional code that does this to draw from as example
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:22:55] seems like the common solution is a groupby
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:23:11] W does your java code handle empty list?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:24:18] lars8, sort of, I simplified it a bit. Reduce itself returns an optional, so it's even uglier than what I showed. The outer optional is empty if the stream is empty
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:25:33] (so you get e.g. Optional<Optional<ElementType>>)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:30:25] assuming you're not going for a one liner, this works: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/ZRSdUe2z
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:31:17] definition of and is what xsperry posted above, foldr (&&) True, so you can write it like that as well
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:32:07] so: allEqual (x:xs) = foldr (&&) True (map (==x) xs)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:32:28] writing out the type is optional, but it is allEqual :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[22:34:03] nice i like haskell
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:37:06] it looks a lot cleaner in Haskell than Java, that's for sure, but I kind of still don't like it. But thanks for providing what I asked after, regardless
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:39:14] I guess my code is blowing up the interpreter but I can't figure out why. Why Why Why???!!!  :)   Everything looks in order. At first I thought it was the paste site I was using but an other paste site (and locally) give the same result.  It looks like it's executing every control block without regard to the conditions.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[22:39:18] yes the foldr is the most natural approach it builds the value from the list
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[22:40:23] foldr the ultimate structure-preserving transformation
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:40:30] also, I guess there's a conflict of interest between parallelizability and short-circuiting on knowing the conclusion halfway through; at least if you want both, you would need a coordinating mechanism to cancel pending comparisons, which might just be more expensive than what you gain
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:42:24] indeed
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:43:35] W: you could do some chunking, having more "threads" than cpu threads would be counter productive anway, so it will be split up into 2..64 chunks, not that many chunks
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:45:37] if(condition) {...} else {...}  Is there any scenario in which both blcoks could be executed?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:45:47] pyzozord, I mean, the Java implementation does do that, just without any way to cancel if you have the answer after a chunk. It creates n*2 threads, iirc
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:46:15] blahboybaz, depends on language; e.g. one with goto or equivalent could do it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	WarauSalesman	[22:46:24] W: just use .allMatch()
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:46:31] I think pyzozord meant to split the list into chunks, then process each chunk on its own, in parallel
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:46:35] much more likely you just got the syntax wrong though, some nested if you missed
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:47:01] ideally, number of elements in a chunk would equal the number of CPU threads
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:47:07] lars8: yes that's what I meant, I had the impression that W understood that the same way as well
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:47:46] I meant n*2 where n=number of cores
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:48:04] W: Node (javascript).
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:48:10] blahboybaz, perhaps in the sense that a compiler might optimize the branch out if they both do exactly the same thing, also branch preditction will run both
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:48:22] lars8: I meant more of number of chunks equal to number of CPU threads to be honest. Then each cpu can do just a linear scan. The first one to find a missmatch needs to inform other threads they can stop
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:48:54] blahboybaz, then no, not that I can think of. Like I said, if it looks like it does, probably something else wrong and the code doesn't mean what you think it does
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[22:49:18] yes can you paste the rest of the code
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:49:30] This is what I have: https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5g9r9uk  - and -  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_nodejs_online.php
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:49:37] I can't figure it out
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:49:45] The code looks fine to me
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[22:50:01] pyzozord, that complicates the code though. and adds synchronization overhead.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:50:28] yeah that's true, insert a sync check ever 100 elements for example or so
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:50:38] I've made it way too complex
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:50:45] Ok it's time for me to go
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:51:10] W: I tried to hepl but I'm "punching up" here so sorry if I wasnt too helpful ;)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[22:52:40] "punching up" in the sense of "trying to help someone more experience than me"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[22:53:16] I'm using Zig and am trying to read user input. What's the ideomatic way to handle an input that's bigger than my buffer (preferably without @panic)?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[22:53:54] Right now, I'm using an arena allocator and .alloc(u8, 100), but that can only accept 98-99 chars
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:53:55] usually line by line
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[22:54:13] blahboybaz: i think the +> in line 16 should be => but which part of the program's output seems incorrect?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Ox151	[22:54:33] hello, how can i remove commits from github, not local git
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[22:54:46] eyynet4: line by line? I'm only reading one line (simple rock-paper-scissors game)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	W	[22:54:58] It was an idle side thought anyway. I've decided on `.collect(groupingBy(identity())).size()<=1`, which is cleaner than what I had, and doesn't need to extract an element from the stream, or use foreach or an explicit loop or anything like that
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Ox151	[22:54:59] i have tried git reset --hard [hash] and then git push -f origin master but the push says everything is already up to date
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:55:23] so you would load one line into your buffer
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:55:32] and then discard it when done
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[22:55:50] I only have one line I need to read, though
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[22:56:34] And it feels wrong to panic on an input that's too long
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:56:55] only one round of RPS? blaphsemy!
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:57:15] someone always wants a "2 out of 3"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[22:57:20] I can call it in a loop, no problem there
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[22:58:39] I suppose I'll just truncate it at 99 chars and go from there
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:58:40] beaky: I saw that - it is not that way in the other places it was me making a change to try and see what was going on and making that mistake - you caught that in exactly the 15 seconds it was like that.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:58:52] what are you truncating?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:58:53] With that corrected the problem I'be been dealing with is revealed
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:59:16] why is the input anywhere near 90 chars
2021-07-18 20:21:09	blahboybaz	[22:59:31] in the other paste site I mean - The prolem underlies that typo though
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[22:59:52] your maximum line length should be the buffer size
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[22:59:57] Right
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[23:01:43] Well that seems to work
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[23:01:47] if you're not seeing a newline then you will have to keep reading until you get to the new line
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[23:03:00] This is all my code, if that helps https://0x0.st/-V8j.zig\
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[23:03:18] ingore the trailing backslash (typo)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[23:05:14] "readUntilDelimiterOrEof" but what about "end of buffer"  ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	swl	[23:05:44] It'll throw a StreamTooLong if it doesn't fit
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[23:05:49] what language is that?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[23:06:03] hopefully they are storing length in "var buf"
2021-07-18 20:21:09	eyynet4	[23:06:05] zig

2021-07-18 20:21:09	InPhase	[03:42:27] If you need to parse data and then make a decision about what to grab, abandon bash immediately, and write this in Python.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:42:29] i have the url link say this one
2021-07-18 20:21:09	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:42:43] https://api.github.com/repos/VSCodium/vscodium/releases/latest
2021-07-18 20:21:09	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:43:23] from this site I want to install amd64 version for ubuntu
2021-07-18 20:21:09	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:43:33] sry download
2021-07-18 20:21:09	InPhase	[03:49:57] guy_frm_yogaland: Here's a starter hint.  Clean it up of course:  d = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen('https://api.github.com/repos/VSCodium/vscodium/releases/latest').read());  L = [d['assets'][i]['browser_download_url'] for i in range(len(d['assets']))]
2021-07-18 20:21:09	InPhase	[03:50:14] guy_frm_yogaland: Needs import json and import urllib
2021-07-18 20:21:09	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:50:24] ok, let me try it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	InPhase	[03:51:56] guy_frm_yogaland: A second filtering list comprehension, and you'll have the amd64 url.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	InPhase	[03:52:32] Then you decide if you want to move the whole thing into Python, or just farm out this url extracting portion and do the primary in bash.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	guy_frm_yogaland	[03:52:54] ok
2021-07-18 20:21:09	sunny93	[04:13:31] What's definition of "procedure call"?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Izem	[04:20:31] invoking a subroutine?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:24:13] hello what is the most efficient way to implement an array in a purely functional programming language
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Izem	[04:25:23] depends on the language
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:25:25] inefficient ways are like using a list and using lambda encoding of a map
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Izem	[04:25:57] does any give you memory access? :P
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:26:05] what is memory access
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Izem	[04:26:40] like allocating memory
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:26:46] memory access is cheating because the memory is like a primitive kind of array
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jeaye	[04:27:48] beaky: https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jeaye	[04:28:09] "in a purely ..." or "for a purely ..."
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jeaye	[04:28:30] I can see how someone might say the first and want the second.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	jeaye	[04:28:38] If so, that link is a good place to start.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:29:10] nice i think clojures vectors are a good approach
2021-07-18 20:21:09	lars8	[04:31:34] a bit more than you asked for, but.. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221241312_Regular_Shape-polymorphic_Parallel_Arrays_in_Haskell
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:31:38] the copy-on-write tree approach
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pikapika	[04:32:35] beaky, hi
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:33:00] hello im beaky
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:34:01] nice i like the repa approach though i think its also cheating by using ghc primitive unboxed array types
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:35:33] whereas the clojure vector approach in theory does not rely on primitive unboxed arrays i think
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[04:54:57] beaky, It seems to me like asking for the most efficient way to implement an integer. It should really be a primitive, otherwise you're stuck emulating it with church encoding or in the array case, a very large product types, or worse, a tree.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[04:56:17] beaky, Does your pure functional language allows controlled mutation (maybe an effect system or similar)?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:56:52] yes i think trees are the worst case (its how integers are implemented in coq)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:57:47] tho coq very recently now has primitive arrays
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:57:59] (but not primitive ints lol)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[04:58:42] no effects in coq its hardcore
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[04:59:18] Without effects, the only way to modify an immutable value is by creating a new one, which means O(n) for every modification of an element of an array. Technically you could amortize the cost and collect the changes into some sort of "diff list", but then you're just piling diff lists onto diff lists, until it degenerates to O(n^2).
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:01:03] For immutable trees it's nicer. You can get to O(log n) where you're creating newer nodes when a leaf changes.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:01:21] I guess the key can be the array index, so there you go, O(log n) arrays.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[05:01:46] yes that is how they implemented arrays for compcert
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[05:02:12] indexed by positive binary numbers
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:02:34] I don't think you can get anything better for a pure language without effects.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[05:04:18] i think the clojure vector approach is more efficient but the one they used is probably easier to prove things about https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert/blob/04f499c632a76e460560fc9ec4e14d8216e7fc18/lib/Maps.v#L184
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:04:19] I worked myself in a corner like that years ago in Haskell and ended up inventing what Rust calls today "interior mutability", but that was only possible because Haskell had unsafePerformIO as an escape hatch.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[05:04:41] nice i like rust
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:04:59] That's why I bring it up :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:06:09] You need effects though, otherwise you're stuck with the logarithmic mutations.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[05:06:41] how does hardware get away with not being logarithmic
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:07:35] Because it gets rid of the unnecessary restrictive abstraction that was added.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[05:09:58] but even in hardware isn't there like a logarithmic (but constant since the width is fixed) propagation delay
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:13:03] Language semantics don't usually have "propagation delay" to worry about, until you're doing functional reactive programming, then you could cause what they call a "glitch".
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[05:13:50] nice i gotta try functoal reactive programming someday
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:17:33] Todays hardware allows random access (RAM as opposed to tapes) and mutation (as opposed to ROM). Both took a lot of time and engineering to make them fast (caches), safe (virtual memory) and durable (ecc).
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:18:05] The language you're describing to me, pure, functional, effect-free and without arrays, seems like it's going backwards on all of those things.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[05:20:50] yes what if we could come up with the vulkan of modern machines
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:25:07] I don't think tea databases care that much.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[05:25:44] It would be a good way to keep a bunch of bored engineers busy though.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[06:01:25] how to write a tsdb (time-series database, not tea storage database unfortunately) from scratch the trick is to use sick sequential writes for maximum performance https://nakabonne.dev/posts/write-tsdb-from-scratch/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[06:54:24] i am looking for ways how to achieve this functionality: I have list of labels-A &  labels-B. I want user to pick=select & drag labels from B & drop in between two sub-sequent labels-of-A.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[06:55:54] in web-app
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[06:57:33] Sounds like handling drag and drop events in javascript
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[06:59:25] There are quite a few options for how to do that based on how you want to UI to behave
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[06:59:59] E.g. do you want list A to "make room" for the B item while still in progress?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[07:00:27] Are you allowing consecutive B items within list A, or must they always have an A item before and after?  These sorts of questions.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[07:02:03] If you do have behaviour distinctions between A and B items in list A, then you probably want an appearance distinction between them.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:10:16] https://aggie.io/wuhaym2e17
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:10:25] PlanckWalk i have rough sketch here
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:10:29] how i want
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:10:40] drag and drop action is shown by different color
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:11:10] any lable from B can be dropped 0 or more times in between labels of A
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:12:35] yes, room =space is required dynamically when label B is dropped in between label A
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:13:19] is it clear enough?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[07:14:27] Wouldn't standard GUI widgits support that already?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[07:15:04] Depends which frameworks you're using
2021-07-18 20:21:09	PlanckWalk	[07:15:21] (And whether the assumptions made by the standard widgets match what you in particular need)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:22:02] i cant find drag and drop kind of stuff on anvil components UI
2021-07-18 20:21:09	Guest9	[07:23:10] https://anvil.works/docs/overview
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[07:48:46] Unpopular opinion, I prefered when websites were just HTML, CSS, templates and some jQuery.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[07:50:02] I preferred when websites were just HTML :P
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[07:50:11] It wasn't always pretty but at least people knew how to build things with it.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	psydroid [07:50:38] prefers when Gemini sites are just Gemdocs
2021-07-18 20:21:09	xeno	[07:51:52] nitrix: in some ways I did too - not because it was good in any way (it wasn't), but because the future looked brighter than what it turned out to be
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[07:53:11] hello the lambda cube is a structure that lets us visualize various generalizations of the lambda calculus. there is the untyped lambda calculus (lisp), various typed lambda calculi with different generalizations like type abstraction or higher kinded types (haskell) or dependent types (LF), with the most general one being the calculus of constructions (coq)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[07:53:13] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube but what programming language do the other corners of hte cube correspond to like λP2 or System Fω ?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[07:57:50] xeno, If you've ever observed how a carpenter works, it's a handful of tools, measure twice, cut once, chisel until perfection. Very laborious, but they get into that flow state doing the motions relentlessly until the impeccable final result.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[07:59:22] xeno, Some languages and libraries let me get that flow state where I'm just given the tools, the raw materials and I work the rest, while others are trying to be insanely complicated all-in-one machinery that you have to turn the right knobs, press the right buttons, but then it does it all for you.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[08:00:06] I much prefer the artisanal approach :/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	xeno	[08:00:31] nitrix: well, HTML is just a fail design, javascript was a failed design, the browser stack a horrible design, and jQuery was a horrible patchwork to make it somewhat usable
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:01:06] yes what if instead we had alan kay's dream of the ultimate application vm environment
2021-07-18 20:21:09	xeno	[08:01:07] I agree that I prefer simple and good tools, but those tools weren't good. It was doing carpetry with a failed prototype for a swiss pocket knife
2021-07-18 20:21:09	nitrix	[08:01:56] beaky, Kind like wasm?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:03:50] I feel like wasm is just shovelling more shit on top of the pile we already have
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:03:50] unlike wasm more like if the web was smalltalk
2021-07-18 20:21:09	xeno	[08:04:18] GeDaMo: it could have been good, but they seem to aim for that yes :/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arahael	[08:04:35] I preferred it when websites were smaller than a compressed copy of the original DOOM.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:04:42] (instead of having apps being shoehrond into the web and its document model)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	smallville7123	[08:07:02] how do i tile render vertex and index data?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:08:19] I recognise all of those words :|
2021-07-18 20:21:09	smallville7123	[08:08:39] haha
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:09:09] yes more like alan kay's croquet project https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquet_Project
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:11:01] the future of programming
2021-07-18 20:21:09	vdamewood	[08:13:30] arahael: No doubt they were more accessible when they were little more than rich-text documents.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arahael	[08:13:40] vdamewood: Indeed.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	vdamewood	[08:14:25] arahael: Now, click on the pictures of homicidal dolls to prove you're not a robot.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arahael	[08:14:46] vdamewood: Ah, yep.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:14:48] whereas something like wasm provides for like islands of applications, alan kay's vm idea thing is for providing a truly distributed and collaborative software environment
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	arahael [08:14:53] taps on the traffic lights.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	vdamewood	[08:15:13] arahael: That proves you'rre not a robot. Robots follow directions.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:17:14] alan kay's vm was also like a distributed database operating on a 'teatime' protocol for updates
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:17:33] a tea-oriented database
2021-07-18 20:21:09	vdamewood	[08:18:01] beaky: You should make a tea-oriented programming languag, where everything is a tea.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:18:38] yes i must revive alan kay's tea protocol
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	vdamewood [08:18:52] hands beaky an error 418.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:19:00] formalize it in coq and implement it in my tea database
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:19:15] it will be the synchronization primitive
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:19:51] but which part of the lambda cube will it sit on
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:21:38] plus they could have gemini in it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:21:41] Can it be in the middle? :P
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:21:46] lol
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:22:14] yes it will have not-quite dependent types like how in c++ templates are not-quite generics
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:22:38] and sorta-higher kinded types but i dont know what that would look like
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:23:05] invented as philip wadler would say
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:23:34] Lambda hypercube! :P
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:24:21] yes with cubical type theory i think they will have to update the lambda cube thing to support hypercubes
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:26:35] because now there are more primitives like 'intervals' and 'path types' (which are not types proper i think)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:27:13] the higher dimensions will be when you have types that have those
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:31:26] very interesting discussion
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	vdamewood [08:31:46] pats pyzozord on the head.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:32:18] damn it I've put myself in so much opportunities to learn that I can't keep up and I'm not sure which one to chase
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:33:34] regarding the truly distributed vm, the etherum vm is like that, that's why I was interested in it for a while
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:34:02] but it's just too tied up with the mon(k)ey business
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:37:01] There was a notion a while back about mobile agents: code that you would send out to collect data for you
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:37:15] I suppose we have that with JS in browsers :|
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:37:17] yes alan kay's dream was like to have that distributed vm, but instead of being oriented towards currency or digital ownership (which i think ethereum is about) was more about douglas englebart style 'augmenting human intellect' things to make collaborative computing possible and accessible
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:37:37] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_agent
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:38:27] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_mobility
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:38:44] nice the dream would be for me to have mobile agents to handle database things on the go
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:42:15] So viruses are mobile agents? Is an agent that replicates itself to a new host without leaving the old host mobile as well, or does it have to be strictly in one place at one time?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:43:38] yes like viruses but more general purpose i think
2021-07-18 20:21:09	beaky	[08:44:08] the original vision for the cloud
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:44:29] oh it's a very interesting concept with code mobility, programs tend to be infinitly smaller than the data sets. Have programs move around, kind of "dock" to a data store, do it's job and move on. While freaking ship tons of data to each small program
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:45:00] s/While/Why/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:45:44] Meanwhile: all the data has to be transferred from memory to the CPU to be processed :P
2021-07-18 20:21:09	psydroid	[08:46:32] the real cloud will come into existence when the pseudocloud has been exposed for the impostor it is
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:46:46] that could be it, maybe the path forward is cpus with build in memory banks and cpu/ram chips as single units
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:47:55] You're still going to have to move a lot of data about
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:48:31] Even something as simple as an add takes two parameters, can you guarantee they're both going to be in the same memory shard?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:49:04] yeah I suppose that's true. Same on the macro level, what if I want to corelate covid data with say weather data
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:52:26] Good morning.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:52:42] Hi mrig :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:52:49] Hello GeDaMo :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:52:50] pyzozord: did you get your bit list thing working?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:53:27] Ah well at least if I go into the dev settings and turn off JS then anything written on medium.com does not run my batteries down :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:54:04] Perhaps there is a simple switch in the browser apps that does this so that I dont need to rummage in the settings.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:54:16] GeDaMo: no I tried the algorithm you suggested but it failes for [0,0,0,0,0]. My version returns [4,5] but expected is [1,4]. I'm having another stab at this in a moment
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[08:54:36] Ah, I hadn't considered all zeroes :/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:54:37] GeDaMo: not the algorithm fails, I think my implementation does
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:55:10] I am starting to consider making a database erp type app with html now, that must mean that something is sinking in I suppose :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:55:24] html being the interface I mean.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:56:26] I'd like to write a teminal module that makes it simple to plug in either to an html browser or a terminal, would be great to do gemini too.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:56:38] mrig: I recommend uBlock Origin with setting to turn of all scripts, images above 50kb and fonts by default and only whitelist the sites you like
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:57:04] yes I use that amongst others, the defaults are generally pretty good.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:57:09] mrig: works very well, annyoing thing is that just browsing web and visitng links people share is kind of impaired
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:57:43] Yes, I have to slowly allow things until which ever site it is that I'm trying to explore starts to work.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:57:54] It's a pain in the ass.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:58:18] But still there is good info on the web and it is an amazing thing.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:58:26] I started judging sites by how well they work without js/fonts/big images
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:58:38] I have to say, some sites are just white backgrounds...
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:58:55] I've high hopes for some sort of AI filter that just removes all the cruft for me.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[08:59:10] huh, cool idea
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:59:17] That would be great. The antipathy of the targeted add.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	furrymcgee	[08:59:29] a text based browser will do
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:59:39] yes it does for most things
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[08:59:51] would be nice to be able to interact with a database too though.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[09:00:08] I also use the adblocker for removing cosmetic things which annoy me
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:00:22] That said, this could be the point in the timeline where it all started to get messy :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:01:34] automated targeted JS removal, prune your search results list and send your results to some massive blacklist database of offenisve JS use.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[09:02:15] I wondered if something like baysian filtering used for email would work on website elements
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:02:40] Within search results?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	mrig [09:02:54] scurries off to look up baysian filtering
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[09:03:40] It's used for email spam filters
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[09:04:07] I downloaded a book on it which I haven't read :/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:04:16] Oh that looks really interesting, some sort of accumulation of data feeding a vector of 'respectability'
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:05:02] Oh books are read at the right time, I have to wait for them to call me when I'm ready to read them; Nothing goes in otherwise.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:06:25] oh yes Bayesian Statistics, right yes I've come across this before, it is interesting stuff.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[09:06:32] https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[09:06:49] Ah, there's a new version
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:07:00] proofs that Newtonian scientists hate to accept.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:07:30] oh that looks great
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:08:14] I'm still working on my basic algebra and calculus at the moment, bet this will be useful eventually though.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:09:57] Oh I did come across what was to my mind the best advertising on the web that I've ever seen.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:10:10] I actually sat and watched the add :D
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mercenary	[09:10:10] The trick is to get the bayesian/AI filter to run in smaller battery envelope than the filtered cruft
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:10:59] mercenary: right yes, you dont want to be burning up fuel to stop the monster, cache and blacklist would sort that though.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:11:42] so long as you dont end up needing servers the size of a google farm to store the list of cruft.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:12:57] https://youtu.be/RFLqlHFoI3M?t=410 <- watchable advert warning.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	mrig	[09:13:17] no objection to stuff that is as clever as that.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[09:50:06] GeDaMo: I short circuted the zeros with early return. The code is very messy, but we got 100% faster thanb all other submissions on leetcode :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[09:50:40] here is my code if you are curious, extremly ugly https://ideone.com/E3ocyQ
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[09:51:43] the part with comparing the three parts actually have me a lot of trouble, first you need to get rid of the leading zeros, then it's a threeway comparison
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[09:52:23] and we are 100% even though I do extra dumb stuff like arr.slice uncessarily really
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[09:52:33] :)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[09:54:41] https://imgur.com/a/UDZOfIP
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[09:55:52] now I need to study my original brute-force clever idea and see if that was also failure at executing the idea or if the idea is flawed
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[09:57:03] also fresh mind makes all the difference in these kinds of problems
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[09:58:01] Nobody else managed to solve that? :|
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[09:58:28] no, it's just our solution is the in the 100% percentail of the fastest js solutions
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pikapika	[10:00:56] pyzozord, hi

2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[10:06:56] Test is the name of the object and __main__ is the current module(?)

2021-07-18 20:21:09	snake	[10:31:54] anyone know how i can repeat a page load in firefox with ipv4
2021-07-18 20:21:09	snake	[10:32:10] with curl you can do -4 or -6 to choose which ip protocol to use, but i dont see that option in firefox
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[10:32:48] Could you use the ipv4 address instead of the domain name?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	snake	[10:33:52] GeDaMo, it says direct ip access is not allowed on cloudfare
2021-07-18 20:21:09	snake	[10:33:56] good idea though
2021-07-18 20:21:09	snake	[10:34:05] this is the site http://ifconfig.co/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	menace	[10:40:55] is there also some tool when i want to reach a certain ip through which ASNs it is routed? would be interesting :D
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[10:41:53] You mean like traceroute?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[10:43:49] Or mtr
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:46:23] how much gb or ram do I need to run a couple of discord bots, a website and znc?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	smallville7123	[10:47:22] CuriousErnestBro: probably much less than 1 gb
2021-07-18 20:21:09	dodo	[10:47:48] depends. is your website facebook?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	smallville7123	[10:47:54] dodo: XD
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:48:00] just a personal blog
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:48:27] I'm gonna experiment with jekyll
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[10:50:01] careful not to let it turn into mr. hyde
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[10:50:06] CuriousErnestBro: you _should_ be able to fit in 256mb or less, but depending on your software choices you might even need 2GB :P
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pyzozord	[10:50:31] frankly this should be doable in 1mb
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:50:43] actually I plan on using R with the bookdown package
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:50:50] https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:53:04] sigh... most of my time is spent learning infra instead of programming
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:53:08] is this what life is in 2021?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:53:49] I'm not really complaining, I find it interesting
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[10:54:04] "infra"?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:55:50] yeah, now I want to learn how to create a website locally, and on push that it gets updated automatically
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:55:56] so I'll be reading up on github actions this afternoon
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arahael	[10:56:07] CuriousErnestBro: I just push from my local machine when I make changes.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arahael	[10:56:33] CuriousErnestBro: I wrote a simple static site generator that 1) Generates the website, and 2) Pushes automatically, and 3) Updates the CDN.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:57:13] what do you mean by "Pushes automatically", is it a bash script that uses rsync or scp or something?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	 *	CuriousErnestBro [10:57:31] uses "push" exclusively in git(hub) contexts
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arahael	[10:58:49] CuriousErnestBro: It's a script, yes, and since my static website is in AWS S3, it use the AWS S3 api.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:59:26] what do you mean, your website is in aws s3? I thought s3 didn't do hosting and you'd have to use lightsail or ec2
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[10:59:55] as far as I understand, s3 is "object storage" (idk what objects are in this context btw)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:00:38] arahael or is your website served through a "lambda"?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	arahael	[11:01:01] CuriousErnestBro: S3 can also serve static websites.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:01:26] interesting...
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[11:09:34] CuriousErnestBro: Checkout Hugo too. I compiles faster than jekyll (I can definitely {not} notice the different in the 2 blogs I have posted).
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:10:56] amanr blogdown uses Hugo under the hood. I'm using Rmarkdown for ease-of-use, and it gives plot and equation rendering
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:12:35] amanr, I plan on using this theme, which looks amazing in my opinion: https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	rannnn8888	[11:13:58] how extrct the rnews text bs4 https://bpa.st/F5VQ
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:14:46] CuriousErnestBro: that's nice and it seems to work without JS
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[11:14:48] CuriousErnestBro: The theme looks so ... creamy. I love it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[11:16:33] CuriousErnestBro: I'd suggest changing the code font to something better imo. FiraCode looks pretty nice. I was disappoined to see how bad Pragmata Pro looked in my blog
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:16:55] Looks like it uses JS for some highlighting but it's not really noticeable without it
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:17:23] yeah I use fira code wherever I can't use Menlo
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:17:32] to be honest, all code fonts look the same to me
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:18:04] GeDaMo I think it uses mathjax.js for the LaTeX rendering
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:18:23] Yeah, makes sense
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:18:24] (that site doesn't have it, but mine will)
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[11:18:41] I use KaTeX instead of MathJax.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[11:18:48] I literally removed it from the theme 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	amanr	[11:18:58] and replaced it by KaTeX. 
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:19:00] I wonder why nobody implemented a static site generator that produces svg instead of shipping mathjax etc.
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:19:20] are svg's particularly big in filesize?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:27:43] They probably compress well enough but it would still be bigger than something like MathJax, I'd assume
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:27:55] How big is the MathJax library?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:30:16] that would remove the limit of using arbitrary packages
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:30:34] Looks like 170K
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:31:17] That must be the compressed size
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:31:44] 790K uncompressed
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:31:56] That seems like a lot :|
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:32:08] 5.3kb for mathjax, and then a "polyfill" library
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:32:34] so only the code that is needed is requested I suppose
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[11:32:39] from that 1mb
2021-07-18 20:21:09	GeDaMo	[11:32:46] Ah
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pikapika	[12:18:29] GeDaMo, hey
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pikapika	[12:19:08] CuriousErnestBro, are js libraries able to decompress on the fly?
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pikapika	[12:19:23] Or do they depend on the server sending compressed data
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[12:19:50] I have no idea
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pikapika	[12:20:03] Apparently apache has a gzip mode
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[12:20:06] that is a good question
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pikapika	[12:20:22] 'mod_deflate'
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[12:20:26] nginx too https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/compression/
2021-07-18 20:21:09	CuriousErnestBro	[12:21:06] compression is done on the fly though
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pikapika	[12:21:32] This is probably the client side feature that supports it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding
2021-07-18 20:21:09	pulse	[12:22:07] pikapika, all webservers transparently gzip on the fly afaik

2021-07-19 11:15:18	Donitz	[17:18:55] but sometimes you just don't have it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Donitz	[17:18:58] so you bite the bullet
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:19:00] it will not be as nice as HM though
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Square	[17:20:24] It's sad the biggest programming language was rushed together by 1 dude at netscape
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:20:26] It's more to protect the programmer than give you some strong guarantee of safety
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:20:56] Maybe if helps the compiler too, but it seems that typescript is a transpiler?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DPA	[17:21:10] |smlckz|: lazy eval is when things are calculated only when they are attempted to be used. So, like, you say x = y(), but you execute, or continue to execute y, when x or x[i] is accessed.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DPA	[17:21:10] Some things may never really need to be executed, or fully calculated.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Donitz	[17:21:32] type safety makes code much better at being self-documenting
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:22:18] lazy eval makes no sense in JS
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Donitz	[17:22:49] it makes sense if frameworks which uses data bindings
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Donitz	[17:22:55] such as in django
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Donitz	[17:23:02] which ofc is python
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:23:25] in general JS just goes over the network, it's now being interpreted as it's being downloaded
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:23:50] the mistake was making JS bigger than what it was supposed to be
2021-07-19 11:15:18	zillion	[17:24:00] i shall try to get used to JavaScript or TypeScript and see how cumbersome it is to create a website using vanilla JavaScript. if it works, there would be no need for a framework.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:24:03] not something you can fault the author for
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Donitz	[17:24:04] come on, the web has become more amazing than ever
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Square	[17:24:10] JS could be pure, why not
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Donitz	[17:24:11] even though it's often misused by shitty news websites
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:24:32] Square yes I agree
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:24:52] but it seems they did not have enough time to think of that (it's research anyways)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	|smlckz|	[17:25:51] whatever you do, or have nice things [abstractions], no problems; when your function call to do some "simple" task has >1M instructions away from the syscall making it a reality, *weep*
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:26:25] JS is not be be making syscalls, or doing any IO
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:26:43] being pure would've been neat, but it's too late now
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Square	[17:27:20] Networking? DOM manipulation?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:28:00] networking is supposed to be transparent isn't it?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:28:33] and yeah, I guess the DOM is IO but I think that's much easier to reason about.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Square	[17:28:38] Just mean it is IO
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:28:41] networking idk
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:29:06] sure, but that's not what I mean
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:29:17] IO is not in ecmascript
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:31:42] In JS all functions are objects, that's pretty cool. I take it that was the same thing in smalltalk?

2021-07-19 11:15:18	GeDaMo	[17:36:16] How can it be an empty array and also have a length? :|
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:36:29] sorry i misworded that
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:36:35] array of empty items :D
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:36:47] a) array of length 3 or b) array of length 4
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:37:06] pulse that has to be null objects?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	GeDaMo	[17:37:10] 4
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:37:24] empty array with members?!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:37:28] wrong, and wrong
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:37:51] [,,,] evaluates to an array [empty x 3] due to the fact the last comma is a trailing comma ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas )
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:38:18] which makes [,,,].length equal to 3
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:38:44] http://www.jsfuck.com/
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:39:10] lol that eval statement
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:39:13] that seems.. safe
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:40:34] i like how it take difficult to understand javascript and makes it easier to understand by just using 6 characters instead of like.... 50 or whatever
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:40:35] i still don't understand why []+[] is a string
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[17:40:45] guess the obfuscated javascript contest would be pretty easy
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:44:36] i think jsfuck is what crockford was talking about in "javascript, the good parts"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:44:58] JS is actually great, but you have to be aware of the pitfalls
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:45:14] oh i agree
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:45:38] if you understand its functional nature its quite great
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:45:47] if something takes me an hour to do in C++, it typically takes me a few minutes in JS
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:45:58] everything it just very rapidly available
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:46:36] its easy to get to qualit output too with the browser being right there (ignoring node)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:47:03] the downside of JS, for me, is that the vagueness of the language leads to a lot of ambiguity in code. it's hard to scale for that reason
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:47:10] not impossible, just much harder than with traditional languages
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:47:22] i guess that's why we have TS
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:47:29] somewhat less vague
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:48:59] i think the problem with JS for me (besides some of its general weirdness around == and ===, etc) is that i just program for the hell of it and javascript has a lot of equally interesting ways to do things
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:49:20] so i often dont finish stuff because it was more just exploring the language than trying to actually do something practical
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[17:50:50] then again, when yo dont have any real goals or deadlines that can happen with most languages
2021-07-19 11:15:18	deniska	[17:51:14] pulse: isn't JS a traditional language at this point? :P
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[17:51:52] idk, when i hear traditional i think Pascal and C
2021-07-19 11:15:18	deniska	[17:53:04] ah, so 50 years old as opposed to 25 years old
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[17:55:20] funny that our field is less then 100 years old and there is already too much of it to learn all of it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	JavaBean	[17:57:30] that is a quitters attitude
2021-07-19 11:15:18	whatsupboy	[18:01:14] 100years old?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:01:16] pyzozord: thats why im learning all of music instead
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:02:10] every collective human intellectual adventure will last as long as there are humans to adventure those relms
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:02:31] every topic is bigger than you could learn in a lifetime
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:02:48] if there is a function in C which takes a pointer as an argument, for example `void f(char *s, char *t) { ... }`, there can be no way that it could "allocate" memory for `to`. so, if i'm passing `to` and `from` to the function, i have to take care of the memory allocation myself in every single case. am i correct?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:03:21] meleoron: you can allocate a pointer anywhere
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:03:32] i mean malloc() allocates an external pointer... thats its job
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:03:45] you need to keep track of your pointer and make sure to free() it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:04:33] its, generally a better practice to "t=malloc(sizeof(things)); f(s,t); free(t);" usually
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:06:27] kzootech: imagine i encounter a function `char *f(char *s)` in some library which promises to provide me some string in `s`, say the current working directory, etc. there can be no case under which i pass an unallocated pointer `s` to `f` and expect it to allocate the space for the pointer and fill in the value because to allocate space for the pointer, `f` would need access to `&s`. right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:08:46] meleoron: if it were char **s it could work
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:08:56] but generally that kind of thing is frowned upon
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:09:24] char *f(char *s) makes me neverous because there is no string length denoted
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:09:40] kzootech: it's an example.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:09:46] so there could be a buffer overrun in your future
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:10:12] the char* that the fucntion is returning could point to memory allocated during the function call
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:10:32] which is likely how you would want to do it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:10:49] idk the examples are a bit to vanilla to say "do it this way"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:11:39] but generally when i get into spots where i find myself wanting to allocate inside a function without free()ing i pause for a bit and consider the overall structure of the program
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:11:57] kzootech: i'm seeing many functions in the GNU libc which have the form `char *f(char *to, char *from) { ... }` where the return value is equal to the value which f set to `to`. which is more conventional: returning values from a function or setting value in one of the parameters?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:12:10] give an example
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:12:23] kzootech: void * memcpy (void *restrict to, const void *restrict from, size_t size)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:12:27] like the strcpy() functions?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:12:30] kzootech:            The value returned by memcpy is the value of to.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:12:40] kzootech: yes.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:12:47] yeah so a) check out that size_t!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:13:01] kzootech: but i'm asking in general as a convention.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:13:04] memcpy does no allocation
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:13:09] kzootech: i know.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:13:29] kzootech: i think there is a misunderstanding. i was asking a hypothetical.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:14:07] meleoron: it would be "bad form" to have memcpy do an alloc() that it didnt free()
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:14:25] as much as possible you want functions to be "side-effect free"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:14:41] and malloc() is a side-effect
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:14:52] kzootech: what i asked was, a function like `memcpy` couldn't *do* any allocation for `to` and `from` if i provide just `char *to` and `char *from` as arguments.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:15:01] kzootech: right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:15:52] well you could still do something like from = malloc(...);
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:16:06] but you are working with a copy of the pointer value
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:16:12] kzootech: i could do it outside the function.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:16:13] so that from will work inside the function
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[18:16:24] meleoron: you cannod do an "allocation at address", when you allocate memory you get new address
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:16:30] but when you return from the function, that value from value isnt coming with you
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:16:51] so you will lose control of a pointer
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:17:03] i think there is a misunderstanding. will you allow me to write a message to clarify my situation?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:17:05] which is the first (and sort of only) step in a memory leak
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:17:32] ?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:17:58] you woud need void *memcpy(void *to, void **from, size_t size);
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:18:20] when you call memcpy it is your job to provide it with the memories it needs
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:18:24] okay, let me completely describe the situation before attempting to answer. i will signal EOF when my message ends. my client doesn't allow indefinite messages.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:18:39] >> EOF
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:18:55] kzootech: cat << EOF, so here it goes :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:19:50] whenever i see a function in C, i see there are many ways to return a value.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:20:34] two are commonly encountered, some functions either return an automatic value or a pointer, and some functions ask for a pointer and set the value to the location that the pointer represents.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:22:13] since i'm still learning C, i was always confused about where you are supposed to allocate the memory for the pointer before passing it to the function. should i *always* allocate memory for a pointer which i'm passing as an argument? should i allocate memory for the variable i would be using to get the return value? should i decide on a case by case basis by reading the manual. such questions
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:22:19] plagued my mind.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DPA	[18:22:39] void do_something(void*from, void*ptr, void(*callback)(void*ptr, void*to)){ char x[] = "123"; callback(ptr, x); }
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:23:37] meleoron: It depends on the specification for the function and what it expects.  Some you can allocate, some can be a local variable, some you can leave NULL.  Others you leave NULL and it crashes the whole program.  So you have to check and know for every call.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[18:23:40] meleoron: just read manual, they will tell what the function expects
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:23:44] now, i think i've got it. RULE 1: no function could allocate memory *to* a pointer `int *p` if i pass just `p` to the argument as i am passing the copy, so ALWAYS declare memory for a pointer before passing it as an argument if you want it to be filled.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:24:06] EOF
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:24:08] RULE 2: if a function returns, just declare the pointer like `int *p` and take the return value.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:24:11] EOF
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:24:28] now, am i correct?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	glguy	[18:24:34] meleoron, your question makes me think you're just misunderstanding something about pointers
2021-07-19 11:15:18	glguy	[18:25:03] to pass a pointer as an argument of a function it has to point at something already
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:25:38] glguy: only if i expect it to be filled.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:26:02] meleoron: Some functions take a pointer and return a pointer which might or might not be the same as the original pointer.  Some functions return a pointer which might be the same as the original pointer indicating success and no move, might be a new pointer indicating a reallocation happened internally, and might be NULL indicating an error happened and the original pointer is not reallocated,
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:26:02] well lets look at memcpy() at bit https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/lib/libc/string/memcpy.c
2021-07-19 11:15:18	glguy	[18:26:04] If you don't want to point to something you'd use NULL
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:26:08] meaning you have to save the original pointer to deallocate it yourself.  All sorts of these varieties happen, and you have to handle whichever one is specified.  That's how C rolls.  When you get tired of the mess, switch to C++ and enjoy the piece of self-managing objects with value semantics.  :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	GeDaMo	[18:26:15] You can't pass a pointer and have it set to newly allocated memory, it would have to be a pointer to a pointer
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:26:32] s/piece/peace/
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:27:01] in C everything is called "pass-by-value"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:27:43] a point is just basically like an int (dont hurt me for saying that people :|), its just a number, a memory address
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:28:00] so when you pass a pointer, to a function you are passing a COPY of that number to the function
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:28:04] glguy: i'm posing hypotheticals here. i could certainly do something like, `int *p = NULL; f(p)` if the behaviour of `f` is based on checking `NULL`.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	glguy	[18:28:32] meleoron, yup, you can either pass a pointer that points to some allocated memory, or NULL
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:28:45] like in assembly language memcpy function call would look like "push dst0; push src0; push length"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:28:59] so those are all stack-allocated values now, when you are talking about them within memcpy()
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:29:15] can you change them? yes but at the end of the function call it goes "pop pop pop"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:29:19] and those values are gone
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:29:20] GeDaMo: thanks.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:29:28] GeDaMo: that's what i was thinking.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:29:35] GeDaMo: it's because of call-by-value.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:29:47] GeDaMo: i just wanted to hear it from experts.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:29:54] i think its confusing because memcpy returns a pointer too
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:30:24] but its not returning a "new pointer", its literally just returning dst0 that you passed in
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:30:39] for convience only
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:30:39] meleoron: If you want to see that peak chaos case, look at the standard and important C function realloc.  It takes a pointer or NULL, it returns the same pointer, or a new pointer, or NULL.  Returning NULL is either an indication of an error, or an indication that you requested a size of 0.  errno is set to ENOMEM if the return was NULL and the size requested was not 0.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:31:20] InPhase: yeah i was just going to find a good example of maybe a string function that can return a pointer that isnt actually one of the ones you passed in
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:31:27] thanks for all the answers but it's not helping.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[18:31:34] C can pass parameters by pointer behind the scenes on you, dependin on calling convention+architecture
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:32:17] meleoron: The real answer is that there's not one approach, there are very many, and they are highly varied.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:32:34] eyynet4: im sure some compilers can also optimize out the push/pop of a function call based on context
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:32:38] whenever i ask a question on convention here, people keep telling me the language semantics.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:32:50] and end up with an "inlined" function call
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:33:05] meleoron: For more concrete answers, you have to move out of hypothetical to specific cases of existing functions, or ask about best practice for a particular use case.  There's no one best practice for all use cases in C.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:33:26] InPhase: ok.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:33:44] meleoron: Understand we weren't trying to give you a hard time.  That's just how it rolls in C.  :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:33:54] meleoron: a lot of being a good program is knowing how to work idomatically, you write things certains because it helps you produce correct code the first time
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:34:22] c is pretty simple language really, but if you are coming from a higher level language you might feel like it lacks a few things
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:34:36] that make other languages "easier"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:34:39] kzootech: Like 50 years of languag evolution...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:34:44] language
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:35:19] InPhase: you're not helping. first of all you reply before EOF. then you're just being hardcore. i'm trying to learn the good practices. looks like there's no good place on IRC to ask questions about C. folks at ##c only know how to mock and folks here assume that anyone asking questions in C still hasn't read K&R.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:35:26] InPhase: 49 years, but whos counting
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:35:28] anyway, thanks for nothing.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	meleoron	[18:35:31] i'll leave.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:35:56] meleoron: i think there was some good information here
2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[18:35:59] looooooool
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:36:04] ah fuck it, nvm
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:37:17] idk i feel like with programming you have to hear the same information 10 times and make the same mistake 100 times before you really get it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:37:33] and then you will still screw up sometimes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[18:39:29] yeah he'll get there, he just has some model in his head that doesn't fit C and is hard to get rid of, probably few more deeper rooted assumptions will need to be reexamined
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:40:05] I've been accused of many things, but hardcore replies before EOF?  That one is a new entry for the trophy case.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:40:41] C is a great language to learn how computers actually work at the programming level
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[18:40:56] what's strange is that he did mention he read K&R
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jck_true	[18:40:57] kzootech++ :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[18:41:08] maybe read it but did not do the exercises
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:41:18] pyzozord: Well K&R teaches syntax, but not necessarily how to program well.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	kzootech [18:41:26] hasn't read k&r :\
2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[18:41:33] me either
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:41:56] which is sort of silly because ive C is my favorite language and ive probably written more lines of C than anything else
2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[18:41:56] k and r C, the original style was gross looking too, IMO
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:42:00] and i have lots of books
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[18:42:18] InPhase: true, but I feel like the question he was asking about allocating memory into pointers that are function arguments is invalid if syntax is understood
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:42:26] eyynet4: i actually appreciate the original way function call were declared
2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[18:42:38] ewwwwwwww! :P
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:42:45] int food(a,b) int a; float b; { ... }
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jck_true	[18:43:05] Where are all the good open source modelling tools? I've used Enterprise Architect at work. Years ago I used ArgoUML but that is no longer supported... I'm looking for a desktop application, not some markup language and a tool that process it into a diagram... Bonus if it does code export to C#...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:43:15] to me that give a bit more of a clear idea of where memory is actualy allocated for passed-in parameters
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:44:09] pyzozord: The exact question intended was unclear to me from the phrasing of that section.  But meleoron didn't get around to the portion of clarifying for a specific use case, so we may never know.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[18:44:55] InPhase: same here, it seemed like he was constructing synthetic example to help him understand something deeper
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[18:45:12] pyzozord: Probably.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:45:27] idk i think i also feel like C is one of those languages where when you learn how it actually works you go through the 7 states of grief
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[18:45:32] step 1 is denial
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[18:45:35] but imo was looking for patterns in rules in the wrong place
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DPA	[18:45:41] It's kind of annoying the old style won't work anymore. The new one has some shortcomings. Like "void f(int x, int y[x]){}" works. "void f(int y[x], int x){}" doesn't. "void f(y,x) int x; int y[x]; {}" isn't valid anymore...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[18:46:15] C is the programming language equivalent of the one ring
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jck_true	[18:46:25] DPA: What about Go's reversed order where you have the name first followed by the type...?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[18:46:26] one language to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DPA	[18:47:19] Jck_true: I think it's less readable, but doesn't matter all that much in the end.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jck_true	[18:47:24] pulse: Well... all the C code I write is in the office at work brightly lit and everything...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	kzootech [18:50:56] writes all his code in a dark room as not to overexpose it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	edgar-rft [19:03:46] writes all his code in a dark room while doing other kinky things...
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:06:05] i like coding when it's raining
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:06:15] peak atmosphere
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DPA	[19:06:48] I like coding while listening to music or watching movies
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:07:13] i really don't like listening to music while coding
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:07:17] idk why
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:07:40] seems too distracting, i like the feeling of becoming one with the code
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:07:51] I tried solving leetcode problems while watching youtube on the other screen. Completly counterproductive. Leetcode demands full attention from me.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:08:19] But I think I could be watching a tv show while doing most of the work stuff.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:08:40] Make a button, remove a button.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:08:55] still slower
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:09:23] in my view you have two options. evade menial work by distracting yourself and prolonging the experience
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:09:34] or just go in with full attention and be done with it much faster
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:10:03] Agree! I prefer the former by far
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:10:44] Although the youtube while leetcode thing I think that was the result of me really struggling with leetcode and not enjoying it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:10:51] It got a bit better recently
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:18:10] usually when im starting i cant listen to music but once im "into" it i can turn on some background music
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:21:25] low ambient or nature sounds are acceptable for me
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pulse	[19:21:52] i rarely listen to anything though
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:23:08] I've been experimenting with no music at all over the last year, it's pretty cool. I certainly feel much less tired at the end of the day
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:23:10] divide and conquer, somewhat unintuitively, does not work well on your attention span :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:23:45] otoh, i've also noticed that i can get some work done most of the time, but it's kinda.. meh?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:23:52] i like jazz, classical, and electronic music when coding
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:24:02] i tend to need to be already familiar with the music to code with it on
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:24:49] i've had days i'm kinda totally off, as well
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:25:11] not sure how it really works. just that on some days i can spend more time reading
2021-07-19 11:15:18	DPA	[19:25:12] A lot of code is nothing I need to think about, but there tends to be a lot of that. A slight distraction is great to not think about the amount of code still to be written, but just write it instead.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:25:25] Biolerplate
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	DPA [19:26:09] Watches the bugs on the plate
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:26:59] sometimes i wonder how many bugs the brain has
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:29:38] DPA: I find that vi key bindings help, it makes typing more interesting, almost like a game. Also when you get good enough at it it really does make you faster
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:29:59] I guess something similiar can be said for emacs key bindings
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:32:08] vinite automata :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:32:38] vi has ruined me
2021-07-19 11:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:32:41] Randomly change key bindings, that'll make it more exciting :P
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:32:48] heheh, that would make a good irc nick, viniteautomoaton :P
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:32:49] i think ESC:wq is how oy exit every program
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:33:06] maybe that's too much finiteautomaton would be good too
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:33:17] i made DEL work as E, but i keep forgetting to usei t
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:33:33] muscle memory..
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:33:44] i also made \e quit insert mode
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:34:06] GeDaMo: write a plugin that randomly reassignes one key every 5 seconds
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:34:08] but i never use either the would-be escape or the would-be ESC
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:34:37] i wanted to write a text editor at some point
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:35:51] but it also quickly involves more than just text editing, would be sad not to have say regex
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:35:54] still need to write a new vi mode that operates on abstract syntax tree instead of text lines
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:36:11] i think its kind of funny that ive been using vi/vim for about 25 years i would guess, my vimrc is 27 lines long including comments lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:36:30] my vimrc is mostly maps and abbrs iirc
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[19:36:55] nice i like vim
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[19:37:01] though i now use emacs
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:37:22] user51: adding regex is easy, one from libmusl is nice
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:37:41] user51: or structural regexps from plan9, I'm sure you can compile it as a library
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:37:59] pyzozord: i tried sam
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:38:11] user51: I never did, how was your experience?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:38:16] http://codepad.org/WP2TQYJg the entirety of my vimrc after ~25 years lol
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:38:23] it blows. somehow it mixed up character based regex matching with a line-based editor
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:38:25] its been longer in the past
2021-07-19 11:15:18	novns	[19:38:53] plan9 is hard to use because their bytes are 9 bits long
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:39:29] pyzozord: you should give it (and acme) a shot, but the mouse focus is really annoying
2021-07-19 11:15:18	novns	[19:39:35] and their bits have three states
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:39:37] i got carpal tunnel a day later
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:39:40] novns: good troll, I almost asked if that's really true
2021-07-19 11:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:39:57] "Implementing Regular Expressions" https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:40:08] i was thinking "8 for extended ascii, 1 for parity"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:40:22] user51: yeah I'm not int o sam's mouse gesturing either. But that syntax seemed very cool
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[19:40:28] plan9 had native utf8
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:40:46] imo the main issue was that the 'line' boundary was broken
2021-07-19 11:15:18	novns	[19:40:53] well, the original definition of byte is "a set of any number of bits, usually 6"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:40:55] beaky: what is "native utf-8"?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:41:11] how many characters per a line do you allow yourself?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[19:41:21] before plan9 everything assumed like ascii
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:41:29] it's one of those cases where an interestin idea doesn't work well in practice because negative area is important
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[19:41:33] but then plan9 came with utf-8 they invented ti
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:41:50] beaky: ascii is utf-8, no?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:42:04] *a subset of
2021-07-19 11:15:18	novns	[19:42:16] kzootech, 8 for enlarged ascii, 1 for purity
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[19:42:19] yes but not all utf8 is ascii so the plan9 people were very careful to make sure everything was utf8
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[19:42:33] oh i see
2021-07-19 11:15:18	kzootech	[19:42:36] novns: lol a purity bit
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	Inhahe [19:43:02] wonders if novns means parity =4p
2021-07-19 11:15:18	user51	[19:43:07] rot bit! :)

2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	novns [19:45:28] point unpolitely
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pikapika	[19:45:36] novns, astronomer types need to know the true north
2021-07-19 11:15:18	novns	[19:46:46] pikapika, just stick to Z axis, it points to the north
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pikapika	[19:47:18] novns, I'll have to lay down the goddamn axes on the ground first though
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pikapika	[19:47:20] Fiesty fuckers

2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[19:48:51] it should be Y axis1`!! grumbles
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pikapika	[19:48:54] Its just an axis, you can point it anywhere
2021-07-19 11:15:18	GeDaMo	[19:49:24] XY was on a flat piece of paper
2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[19:49:27] this is why blender UI was confusing to me
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Wafficus	[20:16:55] if I wanted to programmatically add images to an HTML page but refer to them via a JSON file, would this be a JS idea or could I pull this off with a Python 3 script?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Wafficus	[20:17:11] asking because I wanted to make an art gallery page, but didn't want to have to create a ton of <img /> tags

2021-07-19 11:15:18	lucf117	[20:30:52] yeah, you know, time just flyes. Suddenly I'm 32 yo. Time to find my first job and rent my own place maybe
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[20:31:29] lucf117: better later than never :P
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[20:32:14] sorry that was mean, and uncalled for. No idea what got into me
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[20:33:47] I guess I'm just surprised how one could survive up to that age without ever having to work
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[20:33:58] maybe a bit jelousy there
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:45:43] I'm 34 and never worked.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:45:45] (Don't ask.)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[20:46:20] trust fund baby?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[20:46:25] My first job was at 15.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:46:35] paulo_: No.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:46:43] I badly need a job.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[20:46:50] won the lottery?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[20:46:59] I see, how do you survive modern life?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:46:59] But when you're told you're not the right criteria to work at a supermarket, after a while, you more or less stop caring.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:47:20] I don't, really.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[20:47:36] I'm sorry to hear that, Jigsy. Is there maybe a way we can help?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:47:50] No. Besides, this is my problem, not yours. :P
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[20:48:14] My first computer-related job was at 18, building a 1998-era website.  It was a good upgrade from working in fast food.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[20:48:23] The whole concept of "helping" is based on other people's problems
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[20:48:47] So let us know if there's any way we can lend you a hand, Jigsy
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:49:00] I'll keep that in mind.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[20:49:26] Jigsy: Let's just say, if you ever want advice on job hunting or resume prep for programming jobs, I declare this a reasonable channel to raise such questions in.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[20:50:19] I second that, yes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[20:50:23] yeah this channel has always helped with my career questions
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[20:51:29] I'm nearning 30
2021-07-19 11:15:18	paulo_	[20:51:49] they say in every 30 year old is an 18 year old asking "where did all the time go?"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[20:51:51] It's not easy to know exactly how to do those things until you get on the inside.  So it's helpful to have a place to get answers to what works.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	 *	Jigsy [20:54:24] doesn't know any languages.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[20:54:28] Though I have briefly looked at Golang.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	edgar-rft	[20:57:32] Jigsy: congrats for typing english sentences without knowing the language
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[21:02:20] One has to start somewhere
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[21:02:49] I think I dived in at the deep end, though.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[21:03:58] If you want to learn to, I'm sure the channel will be able to advise you on the best way forward
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[21:04:07] Since I figured trying to code an IRCd would give me some motivation. But it's like "Okay, I need to store the connection. How do I do that?"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[21:04:16] Followed by? "Why is it calling the struct as a pointer?"
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Jigsy	[21:04:20] -?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[21:05:40] I don't work as a programmer myself. Learning by doing a project is always more motivating, but one has to manage difficulty too
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[21:05:56] I'm off to bed, but I look forward to reading everyone's suggestions
2021-07-19 11:15:18	dartmouthed	[21:06:23] Programming-related or otherwise
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:12:21] dartmouthed: the most difficult is to get the first job, each next employer will have much less doubts about you knowing that someone else already hired you in the past
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:13:10] I'm not sure but I am under impression that people who are looking to break into the programming job market nowadays look at people with 10 years experience on the market and say "I want a job like him!" right away
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:13:32] I started with programming job for close to minimum wage
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:14:01] And a pretty shitty boss
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[21:15:45] How's it going now?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:20:21] I have not been really worried about not being to find a job for at least 5 years
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:21:04] If I "lower my standards" I'm fairly certain I can find a job in two weeks at any moment
2021-07-19 11:15:18	whatsupboy	[21:21:09] 5 years?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	whatsupboy	[21:21:13] Thats so long
2021-07-19 11:15:18	whatsupboy	[21:21:20] how did you survive?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:21:44] ho no, i was not staying in a single company, i switched at least 4 times
2021-07-19 11:15:18	whatsupboy	[21:22:10] :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:24:01] I tend to stay 1-2 years in one place then move on. Reasons vary.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:26:42] That has pros and cons, I've seen a lot what people do and I think I have pretty good idea of what's "normal" more so than employees my age who stayed in a single company 4+ years. Also many chances to learn many things from many people. That's cool. On the bad side I don't have experience observing long term effects of my decisions or maintaing long term professional relationships
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:27:47] And people started looking suspecious on my CV recent years, seeing the clear 1-2 year pattern.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:28:25] But when they ask me I tell them honestly that if they will manage to keep my interest for more than 2 years I will stay more than 2 years.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[21:34:07] pyzozord: I don't think anyone on both sides knows what a entry level job looks like :P
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:36:01] Izem: Yeah. To be honest, it's been so long ago for me I started forgetting things.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:37:24] Other things have sunken into subconciousness and work as intuition now. Unfortunatelly people do not treat my intuition seriously, they want to be presented with strong arguments, which I cannot provied easily
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[21:39:15] that's good, improving inuition is great progress
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:48:35] I have a question. Is there a way to do "hot reloading" in C? Meaning changing parts of the program while the program is running?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:49:25] pyzozord: Technically yes, but it's not pretty.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:49:51] InPhase: how would that work in general terms?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:49:59] pyzozord: You have to pay attention to which portions of memory are marked executable if you want to dynamically execute new binary data that you generate on the fly.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:50:31] pyzozord: Essentially you're creating new machine code.  You can generate new machine code from C if you have a compiler integrated.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:51:55] pyzozord: Here's a Hello World demo of direct execution.  :)  https://wandbox.org/permlink/c7YPJoMCXCUCmdc3
2021-07-19 11:15:18	[R]	[21:52:01] pyzozord: SocketMud (the C version) has that feature, but it reloads the /entire/ thing, keeping some network state
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:52:08] That would be pretty cool. One could add the tcc, like they did in quake, they used tcc to compile their own "quake c" language
2021-07-19 11:15:18	[R]	[21:52:38] Also not sure how well it'd work on Windows
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:52:46] [R]: how did you know I was thinking about muds? :D
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[21:53:04] nice someone already wrote a database in rust https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb/blob/master/docs/references.md
2021-07-19 11:15:18	[R]	[21:53:06] I didn't
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:53:11] pyzozord: Note that if you redo that demo with the string literal as a dynamic array of any sort, it is going to crash on most platforms unless you tweak the execute permissions for those pages with some syscall.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:54:02] InPhase: nice, thanks!
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:54:12] beaky: Are you making a rusty tea database?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	[R]	[21:54:33] pyzozord: basically how SocketMud does it, is it uses exec*() to call a new instance of itself in the same process space, some memory is not reset, so it can continue working, but if you do a major change to your memory or objects it's going to poop the bed pretty hard
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[21:54:35] pyzozord: you can do it in the visual c
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[21:54:41] but only for debugging
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:55:43] I was thinking also aobut using .so loaded dynamically, that could work right?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	[R]	[21:55:59] I think that's possible
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:56:08] pyzozord: Sure.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[21:56:28] I'm not sure what would happen if I unloaded old .so and loaded new .so during execution inside the old .so
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:58:46] pyzozord: You have dlopen, dlclose, and dlsym on Linux, which let you dynamically adjust what's loaded.  The symbols grabbed from dlsym can
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[21:59:01] be cast to the right function signature, and then called.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:00:16] would it be an over kill to have .so for each room, each item and each mob in the game? Like hunderds of thousends of .so files?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:00:57] Well it would probably make testing a serious pain.  :)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[22:01:33] yes though not in rust i think i will make my tea database in agda
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:01:35] would it even be able to load itself into memory? It does sound like serious abuse of the dynamic linker/loader
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:01:59] pyzozord: I don't think you should unload something while it's executing.  That sounds like UB.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:02:26] But it would be easy to make a dynamic loading manager that switches rooms.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:02:43] Yeah I'd probably need to have some extra checks/registers/mutexes to check when execution is in or out of a .so
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:02:56] I question this as an architecture, as more standard would be to load data instead.  But there could be a use case for that sort of flexibility.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:03:50] I think here mostly of scripting but done in C and updated dynamically without taking the program down
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:04:10] Note that if you expect bugs in some of the room files, you instead want to do separate files in separate processes, and do some sort of IPC or localhost communication to interface.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:04:43] Then you would get "Room crashed, retreating to previous room" instead of just a hard crash.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:05:06] InPhase: actually I meant to ask, if I ran the dynamic parts in separate threads within the same process, if there would be a segfault in a thread like that, would it take down the main thread too?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:05:12] Yes.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:05:38] You use multiprocess approaches to avoid that.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:05:46] ah that's too bad, so they have to be separate processes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:07:05] ok I see, but that sounds like a big overkill to have a process for each monster and each item separately. I'd imagine few milion processes would need to be supported running at the same time (albeit in very extreme example when there is a player in each room in the game)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:07:37] but lets say the normal amount of processes would be around 100-500 * number of players
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:07:51] pyzozord: Now what can give you the best of both worlds, is embedding an interpreter, and using that for all your added features.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:08:02] pyzozord: You can recover from interpreter errors.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:08:18] yes, it does seem like I just made a full circle :D
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:09:09] Usually there's a reason all the other people came to the same conclusion you reach at the end of such an option evaluation.  ;)
2021-07-19 11:15:18	InPhase	[22:09:53] It sounds like it's for fun though, so go with what's fun.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pyzozord	[22:10:05] Yeah, that's a property of interpreted execution I haven't concidered carefully before
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[22:18:49] beaky: what benefit do you want to get from making the database in agda?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[22:19:49] with agda i get to specify everything with the full power of dependent types for instance if i were designing a query language i can directly specify and something like codd's theorem in agda
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[22:20:04] specify and prove something like codd's theorem*
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[22:22:26] hmm, don't you want to think about a query language after?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[22:22:50] you might want to use an existing query language
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[22:23:28] plus i get unicode mixfix support so i will get to ues all the sick unicode database operators like ⨝ or ▷
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[22:23:47] no i want to abandon sql
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[22:24:26] want about prolog?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[22:24:44] yes something more like prolog (or datalog) would be better
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[22:25:55] for all the reasons explained in this article https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql/
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[22:26:41] there's is also tutorial D from the third manifesto, but I have never looked into it
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[22:26:53] unicode support is nice
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[22:27:17] meh I'm tired of blog posts at this point
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[22:28:03] yes it is a very long blog post but it carefully explains almost everything i dont like about sql

2021-07-19 11:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[23:34:29] After an al day search, I've found what I was looking for. A queue that creates batches of size n (you define n) and that timeouts and flushes after m [unit] where unit can be as low as nanoseconds. https://github.com/fulmicotone/io.fulmicotone.fqueue
2021-07-19 11:15:18	mathAndRhetoric	[23:36:40] I'd almost like to say we should have a producer/consumer pattern with a batching producer that creates batches of n messages or flushes after m [time unit]

2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[00:55:53] normalization in cubical type theory how they proved it correct one of the biggest theoretical hurdles in cubical type theory solved https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7EuLw9E8A8
2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[00:56:35] whats a cubic type
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[00:57:49] cubical type theory is a type theory where the identity types are represented via cubical sets through intervals and path types
2021-07-19 11:15:18	eyynet4	[00:58:12] it really bothers me that the "FWD" is on left, and "RVS" is on right. forward / reverse?

2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[04:23:41] are there garbage-collected programming languages that do not box everything by default like haskell does for data types
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[04:24:32] where everything is unboxed, even user-defined data, and even polymorphic data (which gets 'monomorphized' lke in rust) and only that which necessarily requires boxing like existential types gets boxed
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[04:26:27] but then how would garbage collection work in such a programmming language where one important point of boxing is to provide metadata for the gc
2021-07-19 11:15:18	pavonia	[04:38:13] beaky: Are you sure GC is the reason for boxing in Haskell and not lazy evaluation? I think GCs can also store the necessary information in their own data structures, so the objects don't need to hold that information
2021-07-19 11:15:18	audiocat	[04:38:33] can anyone help me debug? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68435141/why-would-15-20-minute-website-scrapes-work-at-first-but-after-a-couple-scrapes
2021-07-19 11:15:18	Izem	[04:40:26] beaky: Java, Go?
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[04:49:40] i think java uses boxing for everything but through autoboxing makes it transparent
2021-07-19 11:15:18	arahael	[04:52:43] beaky: You can choose to use unboxed types if you really, really need to in Haskell.
2021-07-19 11:15:18	beaky	[04:53:37] yes the goal is to use unboxed types for my tea database for maximum memory size efficiency
2021-07-19 11:15:18	arahael	[04:55:16] beaky: Beware I think if you manage to optimise your program so far that it no-longer allocates memory, it stops triggering the GC.  Which is probably fine, since you're not allocating.

2021-07-19 11:45:31	Square	[17:20:24] It's sad the biggest programming language was rushed together by 1 dude at netscape
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:20:26] It's more to protect the programmer than give you some strong guarantee of safety
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:20:56] Maybe if helps the compiler too, but it seems that typescript is a transpiler?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DPA	[17:21:10] |smlckz|: lazy eval is when things are calculated only when they are attempted to be used. So, like, you say x = y(), but you execute, or continue to execute y, when x or x[i] is accessed.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DPA	[17:21:10] Some things may never really need to be executed, or fully calculated.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Donitz	[17:21:32] type safety makes code much better at being self-documenting
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:22:18] lazy eval makes no sense in JS
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Donitz	[17:22:49] it makes sense if frameworks which uses data bindings
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Donitz	[17:22:55] such as in django
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Donitz	[17:23:02] which ofc is python
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:23:25] in general JS just goes over the network, it's now being interpreted as it's being downloaded
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:23:50] the mistake was making JS bigger than what it was supposed to be
2021-07-19 11:45:31	zillion	[17:24:00] i shall try to get used to JavaScript or TypeScript and see how cumbersome it is to create a website using vanilla JavaScript. if it works, there would be no need for a framework.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:24:03] not something you can fault the author for
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Donitz	[17:24:04] come on, the web has become more amazing than ever
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Square	[17:24:10] JS could be pure, why not
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Donitz	[17:24:11] even though it's often misused by shitty news websites
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:24:32] Square yes I agree
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:24:52] but it seems they did not have enough time to think of that (it's research anyways)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	|smlckz|	[17:25:51] whatever you do, or have nice things [abstractions], no problems; when your function call to do some "simple" task has >1M instructions away from the syscall making it a reality, *weep*
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:26:25] JS is not be be making syscalls, or doing any IO
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:26:43] being pure would've been neat, but it's too late now
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Square	[17:27:20] Networking? DOM manipulation?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:28:00] networking is supposed to be transparent isn't it?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:28:33] and yeah, I guess the DOM is IO but I think that's much easier to reason about.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Square	[17:28:38] Just mean it is IO
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:28:41] networking idk
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:29:06] sure, but that's not what I mean
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:29:17] IO is not in ecmascript
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:31:42] In JS all functions are objects, that's pretty cool. I take it that was the same thing in smalltalk?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:34:53] guess what [,,,] evaluates to in JS
2021-07-19 11:45:31	GeDaMo	[17:35:01] 6
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:35:13] *wrong answer buzzer*
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:35:37] it's either a) empty array of length 3 or b) empty array of length 4 or c) syntax error
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	pulse [17:35:50] starts the countdown
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:35:53] c ?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:35:58] *wrong answer buzzer*
2021-07-19 11:45:31	GeDaMo	[17:36:16] How can it be an empty array and also have a length? :|
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:36:29] sorry i misworded that
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:36:35] array of empty items :D
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:36:47] a) array of length 3 or b) array of length 4
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:37:06] pulse that has to be null objects?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	GeDaMo	[17:37:10] 4
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:37:24] empty array with members?!
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:37:28] wrong, and wrong
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:37:51] [,,,] evaluates to an array [empty x 3] due to the fact the last comma is a trailing comma ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas )
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:38:18] which makes [,,,].length equal to 3
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:38:44] http://www.jsfuck.com/
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:39:10] lol that eval statement
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:39:13] that seems.. safe
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:40:34] i like how it take difficult to understand javascript and makes it easier to understand by just using 6 characters instead of like.... 50 or whatever
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:40:35] i still don't understand why []+[] is a string
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[17:40:45] guess the obfuscated javascript contest would be pretty easy
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:44:36] i think jsfuck is what crockford was talking about in "javascript, the good parts"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:44:58] JS is actually great, but you have to be aware of the pitfalls
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:45:14] oh i agree
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:45:38] if you understand its functional nature its quite great
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:45:47] if something takes me an hour to do in C++, it typically takes me a few minutes in JS
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:45:58] everything it just very rapidly available
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:46:36] its easy to get to qualit output too with the browser being right there (ignoring node)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:47:03] the downside of JS, for me, is that the vagueness of the language leads to a lot of ambiguity in code. it's hard to scale for that reason
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:47:10] not impossible, just much harder than with traditional languages
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:47:22] i guess that's why we have TS
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:47:29] somewhat less vague
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:48:59] i think the problem with JS for me (besides some of its general weirdness around == and ===, etc) is that i just program for the hell of it and javascript has a lot of equally interesting ways to do things
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:49:20] so i often dont finish stuff because it was more just exploring the language than trying to actually do something practical
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[17:50:50] then again, when yo dont have any real goals or deadlines that can happen with most languages
2021-07-19 11:45:31	deniska	[17:51:14] pulse: isn't JS a traditional language at this point? :P
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[17:51:52] idk, when i hear traditional i think Pascal and C
2021-07-19 11:45:31	deniska	[17:53:04] ah, so 50 years old as opposed to 25 years old
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[17:55:20] funny that our field is less then 100 years old and there is already too much of it to learn all of it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	JavaBean	[17:57:30] that is a quitters attitude
2021-07-19 11:45:31	whatsupboy	[18:01:14] 100years old?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:01:16] pyzozord: thats why im learning all of music instead
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:02:10] every collective human intellectual adventure will last as long as there are humans to adventure those relms
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:02:31] every topic is bigger than you could learn in a lifetime
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:02:48] if there is a function in C which takes a pointer as an argument, for example `void f(char *s, char *t) { ... }`, there can be no way that it could "allocate" memory for `to`. so, if i'm passing `to` and `from` to the function, i have to take care of the memory allocation myself in every single case. am i correct?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:03:21] meleoron: you can allocate a pointer anywhere
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:03:32] i mean malloc() allocates an external pointer... thats its job
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:03:45] you need to keep track of your pointer and make sure to free() it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:04:33] its, generally a better practice to "t=malloc(sizeof(things)); f(s,t); free(t);" usually
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:06:27] kzootech: imagine i encounter a function `char *f(char *s)` in some library which promises to provide me some string in `s`, say the current working directory, etc. there can be no case under which i pass an unallocated pointer `s` to `f` and expect it to allocate the space for the pointer and fill in the value because to allocate space for the pointer, `f` would need access to `&s`. right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:08:46] meleoron: if it were char **s it could work
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:08:56] but generally that kind of thing is frowned upon
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:09:24] char *f(char *s) makes me neverous because there is no string length denoted
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:09:40] kzootech: it's an example.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:09:46] so there could be a buffer overrun in your future
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:10:12] the char* that the fucntion is returning could point to memory allocated during the function call
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:10:32] which is likely how you would want to do it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:10:49] idk the examples are a bit to vanilla to say "do it this way"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:11:39] but generally when i get into spots where i find myself wanting to allocate inside a function without free()ing i pause for a bit and consider the overall structure of the program
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:11:57] kzootech: i'm seeing many functions in the GNU libc which have the form `char *f(char *to, char *from) { ... }` where the return value is equal to the value which f set to `to`. which is more conventional: returning values from a function or setting value in one of the parameters?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:12:10] give an example
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:12:23] kzootech: void * memcpy (void *restrict to, const void *restrict from, size_t size)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:12:27] like the strcpy() functions?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:12:30] kzootech:            The value returned by memcpy is the value of to.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:12:40] kzootech: yes.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:12:47] yeah so a) check out that size_t!
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:13:01] kzootech: but i'm asking in general as a convention.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:13:04] memcpy does no allocation
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:13:09] kzootech: i know.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:13:29] kzootech: i think there is a misunderstanding. i was asking a hypothetical.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:14:07] meleoron: it would be "bad form" to have memcpy do an alloc() that it didnt free()
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:14:25] as much as possible you want functions to be "side-effect free"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:14:41] and malloc() is a side-effect
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:14:52] kzootech: what i asked was, a function like `memcpy` couldn't *do* any allocation for `to` and `from` if i provide just `char *to` and `char *from` as arguments.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:15:01] kzootech: right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:15:52] well you could still do something like from = malloc(...);
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:16:06] but you are working with a copy of the pointer value
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:16:12] kzootech: i could do it outside the function.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:16:13] so that from will work inside the function
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[18:16:24] meleoron: you cannod do an "allocation at address", when you allocate memory you get new address
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:16:30] but when you return from the function, that value from value isnt coming with you
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:16:51] so you will lose control of a pointer
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:17:03] i think there is a misunderstanding. will you allow me to write a message to clarify my situation?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:17:05] which is the first (and sort of only) step in a memory leak
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:17:32] ?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:17:58] you woud need void *memcpy(void *to, void **from, size_t size);
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:18:20] when you call memcpy it is your job to provide it with the memories it needs
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:18:24] okay, let me completely describe the situation before attempting to answer. i will signal EOF when my message ends. my client doesn't allow indefinite messages.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:18:39] >> EOF
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:18:55] kzootech: cat << EOF, so here it goes :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:19:50] whenever i see a function in C, i see there are many ways to return a value.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:20:34] two are commonly encountered, some functions either return an automatic value or a pointer, and some functions ask for a pointer and set the value to the location that the pointer represents.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:22:13] since i'm still learning C, i was always confused about where you are supposed to allocate the memory for the pointer before passing it to the function. should i *always* allocate memory for a pointer which i'm passing as an argument? should i allocate memory for the variable i would be using to get the return value? should i decide on a case by case basis by reading the manual. such questions
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:22:19] plagued my mind.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DPA	[18:22:39] void do_something(void*from, void*ptr, void(*callback)(void*ptr, void*to)){ char x[] = "123"; callback(ptr, x); }
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:23:37] meleoron: It depends on the specification for the function and what it expects.  Some you can allocate, some can be a local variable, some you can leave NULL.  Others you leave NULL and it crashes the whole program.  So you have to check and know for every call.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[18:23:40] meleoron: just read manual, they will tell what the function expects
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:23:44] now, i think i've got it. RULE 1: no function could allocate memory *to* a pointer `int *p` if i pass just `p` to the argument as i am passing the copy, so ALWAYS declare memory for a pointer before passing it as an argument if you want it to be filled.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:24:06] EOF
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:24:08] RULE 2: if a function returns, just declare the pointer like `int *p` and take the return value.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:24:11] EOF
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:24:28] now, am i correct?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	glguy	[18:24:34] meleoron, your question makes me think you're just misunderstanding something about pointers
2021-07-19 11:45:31	glguy	[18:25:03] to pass a pointer as an argument of a function it has to point at something already
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:25:38] glguy: only if i expect it to be filled.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:26:02] meleoron: Some functions take a pointer and return a pointer which might or might not be the same as the original pointer.  Some functions return a pointer which might be the same as the original pointer indicating success and no move, might be a new pointer indicating a reallocation happened internally, and might be NULL indicating an error happened and the original pointer is not reallocated,
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:26:02] well lets look at memcpy() at bit https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/lib/libc/string/memcpy.c
2021-07-19 11:45:31	glguy	[18:26:04] If you don't want to point to something you'd use NULL
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:26:08] meaning you have to save the original pointer to deallocate it yourself.  All sorts of these varieties happen, and you have to handle whichever one is specified.  That's how C rolls.  When you get tired of the mess, switch to C++ and enjoy the piece of self-managing objects with value semantics.  :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	GeDaMo	[18:26:15] You can't pass a pointer and have it set to newly allocated memory, it would have to be a pointer to a pointer
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:26:32] s/piece/peace/
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:27:01] in C everything is called "pass-by-value"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:27:43] a point is just basically like an int (dont hurt me for saying that people :|), its just a number, a memory address
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:28:00] so when you pass a pointer, to a function you are passing a COPY of that number to the function
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:28:04] glguy: i'm posing hypotheticals here. i could certainly do something like, `int *p = NULL; f(p)` if the behaviour of `f` is based on checking `NULL`.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	glguy	[18:28:32] meleoron, yup, you can either pass a pointer that points to some allocated memory, or NULL
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:28:45] like in assembly language memcpy function call would look like "push dst0; push src0; push length"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:28:59] so those are all stack-allocated values now, when you are talking about them within memcpy()
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:29:15] can you change them? yes but at the end of the function call it goes "pop pop pop"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:29:19] and those values are gone
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:29:20] GeDaMo: thanks.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:29:28] GeDaMo: that's what i was thinking.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:29:35] GeDaMo: it's because of call-by-value.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:29:47] GeDaMo: i just wanted to hear it from experts.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:29:54] i think its confusing because memcpy returns a pointer too
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:30:24] but its not returning a "new pointer", its literally just returning dst0 that you passed in
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:30:39] for convience only
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:30:39] meleoron: If you want to see that peak chaos case, look at the standard and important C function realloc.  It takes a pointer or NULL, it returns the same pointer, or a new pointer, or NULL.  Returning NULL is either an indication of an error, or an indication that you requested a size of 0.  errno is set to ENOMEM if the return was NULL and the size requested was not 0.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:31:20] InPhase: yeah i was just going to find a good example of maybe a string function that can return a pointer that isnt actually one of the ones you passed in
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:31:27] thanks for all the answers but it's not helping.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	eyynet4	[18:31:34] C can pass parameters by pointer behind the scenes on you, dependin on calling convention+architecture
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:32:17] meleoron: The real answer is that there's not one approach, there are very many, and they are highly varied.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:32:34] eyynet4: im sure some compilers can also optimize out the push/pop of a function call based on context
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:32:38] whenever i ask a question on convention here, people keep telling me the language semantics.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:32:50] and end up with an "inlined" function call
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:33:05] meleoron: For more concrete answers, you have to move out of hypothetical to specific cases of existing functions, or ask about best practice for a particular use case.  There's no one best practice for all use cases in C.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:33:26] InPhase: ok.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:33:44] meleoron: Understand we weren't trying to give you a hard time.  That's just how it rolls in C.  :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:33:54] meleoron: a lot of being a good program is knowing how to work idomatically, you write things certains because it helps you produce correct code the first time
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:34:22] c is pretty simple language really, but if you are coming from a higher level language you might feel like it lacks a few things
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:34:36] that make other languages "easier"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:34:39] kzootech: Like 50 years of languag evolution...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:34:44] language
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:35:19] InPhase: you're not helping. first of all you reply before EOF. then you're just being hardcore. i'm trying to learn the good practices. looks like there's no good place on IRC to ask questions about C. folks at ##c only know how to mock and folks here assume that anyone asking questions in C still hasn't read K&R.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:35:26] InPhase: 49 years, but whos counting
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:35:28] anyway, thanks for nothing.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	meleoron	[18:35:31] i'll leave.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:35:56] meleoron: i think there was some good information here
2021-07-19 11:45:31	eyynet4	[18:35:59] looooooool
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:36:04] ah fuck it, nvm
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:37:17] idk i feel like with programming you have to hear the same information 10 times and make the same mistake 100 times before you really get it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:37:33] and then you will still screw up sometimes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[18:39:29] yeah he'll get there, he just has some model in his head that doesn't fit C and is hard to get rid of, probably few more deeper rooted assumptions will need to be reexamined
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:40:05] I've been accused of many things, but hardcore replies before EOF?  That one is a new entry for the trophy case.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:40:41] C is a great language to learn how computers actually work at the programming level
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[18:40:56] what's strange is that he did mention he read K&R
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jck_true	[18:40:57] kzootech++ :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[18:41:08] maybe read it but did not do the exercises
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:41:18] pyzozord: Well K&R teaches syntax, but not necessarily how to program well.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	kzootech [18:41:26] hasn't read k&r :\
2021-07-19 11:45:31	eyynet4	[18:41:33] me either
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:41:56] which is sort of silly because ive C is my favorite language and ive probably written more lines of C than anything else
2021-07-19 11:45:31	eyynet4	[18:41:56] k and r C, the original style was gross looking too, IMO
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:42:00] and i have lots of books
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[18:42:18] InPhase: true, but I feel like the question he was asking about allocating memory into pointers that are function arguments is invalid if syntax is understood
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:42:26] eyynet4: i actually appreciate the original way function call were declared
2021-07-19 11:45:31	eyynet4	[18:42:38] ewwwwwwww! :P
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:42:45] int food(a,b) int a; float b; { ... }
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jck_true	[18:43:05] Where are all the good open source modelling tools? I've used Enterprise Architect at work. Years ago I used ArgoUML but that is no longer supported... I'm looking for a desktop application, not some markup language and a tool that process it into a diagram... Bonus if it does code export to C#...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:43:15] to me that give a bit more of a clear idea of where memory is actualy allocated for passed-in parameters
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:44:09] pyzozord: The exact question intended was unclear to me from the phrasing of that section.  But meleoron didn't get around to the portion of clarifying for a specific use case, so we may never know.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[18:44:55] InPhase: same here, it seemed like he was constructing synthetic example to help him understand something deeper
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[18:45:12] pyzozord: Probably.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:45:27] idk i think i also feel like C is one of those languages where when you learn how it actually works you go through the 7 states of grief
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[18:45:32] step 1 is denial
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[18:45:35] but imo was looking for patterns in rules in the wrong place
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DPA	[18:45:41] It's kind of annoying the old style won't work anymore. The new one has some shortcomings. Like "void f(int x, int y[x]){}" works. "void f(int y[x], int x){}" doesn't. "void f(y,x) int x; int y[x]; {}" isn't valid anymore...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[18:46:15] C is the programming language equivalent of the one ring
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jck_true	[18:46:25] DPA: What about Go's reversed order where you have the name first followed by the type...?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[18:46:26] one language to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DPA	[18:47:19] Jck_true: I think it's less readable, but doesn't matter all that much in the end.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jck_true	[18:47:24] pulse: Well... all the C code I write is in the office at work brightly lit and everything...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	kzootech [18:50:56] writes all his code in a dark room as not to overexpose it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	edgar-rft [19:03:46] writes all his code in a dark room while doing other kinky things...
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:06:05] i like coding when it's raining
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:06:15] peak atmosphere
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DPA	[19:06:48] I like coding while listening to music or watching movies
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:07:13] i really don't like listening to music while coding
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:07:17] idk why
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:07:40] seems too distracting, i like the feeling of becoming one with the code
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:07:51] I tried solving leetcode problems while watching youtube on the other screen. Completly counterproductive. Leetcode demands full attention from me.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:08:19] But I think I could be watching a tv show while doing most of the work stuff.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:08:40] Make a button, remove a button.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:08:55] still slower
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:09:23] in my view you have two options. evade menial work by distracting yourself and prolonging the experience
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:09:34] or just go in with full attention and be done with it much faster
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:10:03] Agree! I prefer the former by far
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:10:44] Although the youtube while leetcode thing I think that was the result of me really struggling with leetcode and not enjoying it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:10:51] It got a bit better recently
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:18:10] usually when im starting i cant listen to music but once im "into" it i can turn on some background music
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:21:25] low ambient or nature sounds are acceptable for me
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pulse	[19:21:52] i rarely listen to anything though
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:23:08] I've been experimenting with no music at all over the last year, it's pretty cool. I certainly feel much less tired at the end of the day
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:23:10] divide and conquer, somewhat unintuitively, does not work well on your attention span :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:23:45] otoh, i've also noticed that i can get some work done most of the time, but it's kinda.. meh?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:23:52] i like jazz, classical, and electronic music when coding
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:24:02] i tend to need to be already familiar with the music to code with it on
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:24:49] i've had days i'm kinda totally off, as well
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:25:11] not sure how it really works. just that on some days i can spend more time reading
2021-07-19 11:45:31	DPA	[19:25:12] A lot of code is nothing I need to think about, but there tends to be a lot of that. A slight distraction is great to not think about the amount of code still to be written, but just write it instead.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	GeDaMo	[19:25:25] Biolerplate
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	DPA [19:26:09] Watches the bugs on the plate
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:26:59] sometimes i wonder how many bugs the brain has
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:29:38] DPA: I find that vi key bindings help, it makes typing more interesting, almost like a game. Also when you get good enough at it it really does make you faster
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:29:59] I guess something similiar can be said for emacs key bindings
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:32:08] vinite automata :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:32:38] vi has ruined me
2021-07-19 11:45:31	GeDaMo	[19:32:41] Randomly change key bindings, that'll make it more exciting :P
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:32:48] heheh, that would make a good irc nick, viniteautomoaton :P
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:32:49] i think ESC:wq is how oy exit every program
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:33:06] maybe that's too much finiteautomaton would be good too
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:33:17] i made DEL work as E, but i keep forgetting to usei t
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:33:33] muscle memory..
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:33:44] i also made \e quit insert mode
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:34:06] GeDaMo: write a plugin that randomly reassignes one key every 5 seconds
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:34:08] but i never use either the would-be escape or the would-be ESC
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:34:37] i wanted to write a text editor at some point
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:35:51] but it also quickly involves more than just text editing, would be sad not to have say regex
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:35:54] still need to write a new vi mode that operates on abstract syntax tree instead of text lines
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:36:11] i think its kind of funny that ive been using vi/vim for about 25 years i would guess, my vimrc is 27 lines long including comments lol
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:36:30] my vimrc is mostly maps and abbrs iirc
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[19:36:55] nice i like vim
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[19:37:01] though i now use emacs
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:37:22] user51: adding regex is easy, one from libmusl is nice
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:37:41] user51: or structural regexps from plan9, I'm sure you can compile it as a library
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:37:59] pyzozord: i tried sam
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:38:11] user51: I never did, how was your experience?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:38:16] http://codepad.org/WP2TQYJg the entirety of my vimrc after ~25 years lol
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:38:23] it blows. somehow it mixed up character based regex matching with a line-based editor
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:38:25] its been longer in the past
2021-07-19 11:45:31	novns	[19:38:53] plan9 is hard to use because their bytes are 9 bits long
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:39:29] pyzozord: you should give it (and acme) a shot, but the mouse focus is really annoying
2021-07-19 11:45:31	novns	[19:39:35] and their bits have three states
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:39:37] i got carpal tunnel a day later
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:39:40] novns: good troll, I almost asked if that's really true
2021-07-19 11:45:31	GeDaMo	[19:39:57] "Implementing Regular Expressions" https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:40:08] i was thinking "8 for extended ascii, 1 for parity"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:40:22] user51: yeah I'm not int o sam's mouse gesturing either. But that syntax seemed very cool
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[19:40:28] plan9 had native utf8
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:40:46] imo the main issue was that the 'line' boundary was broken
2021-07-19 11:45:31	novns	[19:40:53] well, the original definition of byte is "a set of any number of bits, usually 6"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:40:55] beaky: what is "native utf-8"?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	kzootech	[19:41:11] how many characters per a line do you allow yourself?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[19:41:21] before plan9 everything assumed like ascii
2021-07-19 11:45:31	user51	[19:41:29] it's one of those cases where an interestin idea doesn't work well in practice because negative area is important
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[19:41:33] but then plan9 came with utf-8 they invented ti
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:41:50] beaky: ascii is utf-8, no?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:42:04] *a subset of
2021-07-19 11:45:31	novns	[19:42:16] kzootech, 8 for enlarged ascii, 1 for purity
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[19:42:19] yes but not all utf8 is ascii so the plan9 people were very careful to make sure everything was utf8
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[19:42:33] oh i see

2021-07-19 11:45:31	novns	[19:46:46] pikapika, just stick to Z axis, it points to the north
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pikapika	[19:47:18] novns, I'll have to lay down the goddamn axes on the ground first though

2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[20:27:24] can't believe it's already september
2021-07-19 11:45:31	lucf117	[20:30:52] yeah, you know, time just flyes. Suddenly I'm 32 yo. Time to find my first job and rent my own place maybe
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[20:31:29] lucf117: better later than never :P
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[20:32:14] sorry that was mean, and uncalled for. No idea what got into me
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[20:33:47] I guess I'm just surprised how one could survive up to that age without ever having to work
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[20:33:58] maybe a bit jelousy there
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:45:43] I'm 34 and never worked.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:45:45] (Don't ask.)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[20:46:20] trust fund baby?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[20:46:25] My first job was at 15.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:46:35] paulo_: No.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:46:43] I badly need a job.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[20:46:50] won the lottery?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[20:46:59] I see, how do you survive modern life?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:46:59] But when you're told you're not the right criteria to work at a supermarket, after a while, you more or less stop caring.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:47:20] I don't, really.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[20:47:36] I'm sorry to hear that, Jigsy. Is there maybe a way we can help?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:47:50] No. Besides, this is my problem, not yours. :P
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[20:48:14] My first computer-related job was at 18, building a 1998-era website.  It was a good upgrade from working in fast food.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[20:48:23] The whole concept of "helping" is based on other people's problems
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[20:48:47] So let us know if there's any way we can lend you a hand, Jigsy
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:49:00] I'll keep that in mind.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[20:49:26] Jigsy: Let's just say, if you ever want advice on job hunting or resume prep for programming jobs, I declare this a reasonable channel to raise such questions in.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[20:50:19] I second that, yes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[20:50:23] yeah this channel has always helped with my career questions
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[20:51:29] I'm nearning 30
2021-07-19 11:45:31	paulo_	[20:51:49] they say in every 30 year old is an 18 year old asking "where did all the time go?"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[20:51:51] It's not easy to know exactly how to do those things until you get on the inside.  So it's helpful to have a place to get answers to what works.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	 *	Jigsy [20:54:24] doesn't know any languages.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[20:54:28] Though I have briefly looked at Golang.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	edgar-rft	[20:57:32] Jigsy: congrats for typing english sentences without knowing the language
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[21:02:20] One has to start somewhere
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[21:02:49] I think I dived in at the deep end, though.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[21:03:58] If you want to learn to, I'm sure the channel will be able to advise you on the best way forward
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[21:04:07] Since I figured trying to code an IRCd would give me some motivation. But it's like "Okay, I need to store the connection. How do I do that?"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[21:04:16] Followed by? "Why is it calling the struct as a pointer?"
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Jigsy	[21:04:20] -?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[21:05:40] I don't work as a programmer myself. Learning by doing a project is always more motivating, but one has to manage difficulty too
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[21:05:56] I'm off to bed, but I look forward to reading everyone's suggestions
2021-07-19 11:45:31	dartmouthed	[21:06:23] Programming-related or otherwise
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:12:21] dartmouthed: the most difficult is to get the first job, each next employer will have much less doubts about you knowing that someone else already hired you in the past
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:13:10] I'm not sure but I am under impression that people who are looking to break into the programming job market nowadays look at people with 10 years experience on the market and say "I want a job like him!" right away
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:13:32] I started with programming job for close to minimum wage
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:14:01] And a pretty shitty boss
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[21:15:45] How's it going now?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:20:21] I have not been really worried about not being to find a job for at least 5 years
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:21:04] If I "lower my standards" I'm fairly certain I can find a job in two weeks at any moment
2021-07-19 11:45:31	whatsupboy	[21:21:09] 5 years?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	whatsupboy	[21:21:13] Thats so long
2021-07-19 11:45:31	whatsupboy	[21:21:20] how did you survive?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:21:44] ho no, i was not staying in a single company, i switched at least 4 times
2021-07-19 11:45:31	whatsupboy	[21:22:10] :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:24:01] I tend to stay 1-2 years in one place then move on. Reasons vary.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:26:42] That has pros and cons, I've seen a lot what people do and I think I have pretty good idea of what's "normal" more so than employees my age who stayed in a single company 4+ years. Also many chances to learn many things from many people. That's cool. On the bad side I don't have experience observing long term effects of my decisions or maintaing long term professional relationships
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:27:47] And people started looking suspecious on my CV recent years, seeing the clear 1-2 year pattern.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:28:25] But when they ask me I tell them honestly that if they will manage to keep my interest for more than 2 years I will stay more than 2 years.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[21:34:07] pyzozord: I don't think anyone on both sides knows what a entry level job looks like :P
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:36:01] Izem: Yeah. To be honest, it's been so long ago for me I started forgetting things.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:37:24] Other things have sunken into subconciousness and work as intuition now. Unfortunatelly people do not treat my intuition seriously, they want to be presented with strong arguments, which I cannot provied easily
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[21:39:15] that's good, improving inuition is great progress
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:48:35] I have a question. Is there a way to do "hot reloading" in C? Meaning changing parts of the program while the program is running?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:49:25] pyzozord: Technically yes, but it's not pretty.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:49:51] InPhase: how would that work in general terms?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:49:59] pyzozord: You have to pay attention to which portions of memory are marked executable if you want to dynamically execute new binary data that you generate on the fly.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:50:31] pyzozord: Essentially you're creating new machine code.  You can generate new machine code from C if you have a compiler integrated.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:51:55] pyzozord: Here's a Hello World demo of direct execution.  :)  https://wandbox.org/permlink/c7YPJoMCXCUCmdc3
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[R]	[21:52:01] pyzozord: SocketMud (the C version) has that feature, but it reloads the /entire/ thing, keeping some network state
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:52:08] That would be pretty cool. One could add the tcc, like they did in quake, they used tcc to compile their own "quake c" language
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[R]	[21:52:38] Also not sure how well it'd work on Windows
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:52:46] [R]: how did you know I was thinking about muds? :D
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[21:53:04] nice someone already wrote a database in rust https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb/blob/master/docs/references.md
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[R]	[21:53:06] I didn't
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:53:11] pyzozord: Note that if you redo that demo with the string literal as a dynamic array of any sort, it is going to crash on most platforms unless you tweak the execute permissions for those pages with some syscall.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:54:02] InPhase: nice, thanks!
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:54:12] beaky: Are you making a rusty tea database?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[R]	[21:54:33] pyzozord: basically how SocketMud does it, is it uses exec*() to call a new instance of itself in the same process space, some memory is not reset, so it can continue working, but if you do a major change to your memory or objects it's going to poop the bed pretty hard
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[21:54:35] pyzozord: you can do it in the visual c
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[21:54:41] but only for debugging
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:55:43] I was thinking also aobut using .so loaded dynamically, that could work right?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	[R]	[21:55:59] I think that's possible
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:56:08] pyzozord: Sure.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[21:56:28] I'm not sure what would happen if I unloaded old .so and loaded new .so during execution inside the old .so
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:58:46] pyzozord: You have dlopen, dlclose, and dlsym on Linux, which let you dynamically adjust what's loaded.  The symbols grabbed from dlsym can
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[21:59:01] be cast to the right function signature, and then called.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:00:16] would it be an over kill to have .so for each room, each item and each mob in the game? Like hunderds of thousends of .so files?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:00:57] Well it would probably make testing a serious pain.  :)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[22:01:33] yes though not in rust i think i will make my tea database in agda
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:01:35] would it even be able to load itself into memory? It does sound like serious abuse of the dynamic linker/loader
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:01:59] pyzozord: I don't think you should unload something while it's executing.  That sounds like UB.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:02:26] But it would be easy to make a dynamic loading manager that switches rooms.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:02:43] Yeah I'd probably need to have some extra checks/registers/mutexes to check when execution is in or out of a .so
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:02:56] I question this as an architecture, as more standard would be to load data instead.  But there could be a use case for that sort of flexibility.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:03:50] I think here mostly of scripting but done in C and updated dynamically without taking the program down
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:04:10] Note that if you expect bugs in some of the room files, you instead want to do separate files in separate processes, and do some sort of IPC or localhost communication to interface.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:04:43] Then you would get "Room crashed, retreating to previous room" instead of just a hard crash.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:05:06] InPhase: actually I meant to ask, if I ran the dynamic parts in separate threads within the same process, if there would be a segfault in a thread like that, would it take down the main thread too?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:05:12] Yes.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:05:38] You use multiprocess approaches to avoid that.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:05:46] ah that's too bad, so they have to be separate processes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:07:05] ok I see, but that sounds like a big overkill to have a process for each monster and each item separately. I'd imagine few milion processes would need to be supported running at the same time (albeit in very extreme example when there is a player in each room in the game)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:07:37] but lets say the normal amount of processes would be around 100-500 * number of players
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:07:51] pyzozord: Now what can give you the best of both worlds, is embedding an interpreter, and using that for all your added features.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:08:02] pyzozord: You can recover from interpreter errors.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:08:18] yes, it does seem like I just made a full circle :D
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:09:09] Usually there's a reason all the other people came to the same conclusion you reach at the end of such an option evaluation.  ;)
2021-07-19 11:45:31	InPhase	[22:09:53] It sounds like it's for fun though, so go with what's fun.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pyzozord	[22:10:05] Yeah, that's a property of interpreted execution I haven't concidered carefully before
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[22:18:49] beaky: what benefit do you want to get from making the database in agda?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[22:19:49] with agda i get to specify everything with the full power of dependent types for instance if i were designing a query language i can directly specify and something like codd's theorem in agda
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[22:20:04] specify and prove something like codd's theorem*
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[22:22:26] hmm, don't you want to think about a query language after?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[22:22:50] you might want to use an existing query language
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[22:23:28] plus i get unicode mixfix support so i will get to ues all the sick unicode database operators like ⨝ or ▷
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[22:23:47] no i want to abandon sql
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[22:24:26] want about prolog?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[22:24:44] yes something more like prolog (or datalog) would be better
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[22:25:55] for all the reasons explained in this article https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql/
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[22:26:41] there's is also tutorial D from the third manifesto, but I have never looked into it
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[22:26:53] unicode support is nice
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[22:27:17] meh I'm tired of blog posts at this point
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[22:28:03] yes it is a very long blog post but it carefully explains almost everything i dont like about sql
2021-07-19 11:45:31	smallville7123	[22:28:34] god damn i wish my transfer speeds where this high

2021-07-19 11:45:31	mathAndRhetoric	[23:34:29] After an al day search, I've found what I was looking for. A queue that creates batches of size n (you define n) and that timeouts and flushes after m [unit] where unit can be as low as nanoseconds. https://github.com/fulmicotone/io.fulmicotone.fqueue
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mathAndRhetoric	[23:36:40] I'd almost like to say we should have a producer/consumer pattern with a batching producer that creates batches of n messages or flushes after m [time unit]

2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[00:55:53] normalization in cubical type theory how they proved it correct one of the biggest theoretical hurdles in cubical type theory solved https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7EuLw9E8A8
2021-07-19 11:45:31	eyynet4	[00:56:35] whats a cubic type
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[00:57:49] cubical type theory is a type theory where the identity types are represented via cubical sets through intervals and path types
2021-07-19 11:45:31	eyynet4	[00:58:12] it really bothers me that the "FWD" is on left, and "RVS" is on right. forward / reverse?

2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[04:23:41] are there garbage-collected programming languages that do not box everything by default like haskell does for data types
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[04:24:32] where everything is unboxed, even user-defined data, and even polymorphic data (which gets 'monomorphized' lke in rust) and only that which necessarily requires boxing like existential types gets boxed
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[04:26:27] but then how would garbage collection work in such a programmming language where one important point of boxing is to provide metadata for the gc
2021-07-19 11:45:31	pavonia	[04:38:13] beaky: Are you sure GC is the reason for boxing in Haskell and not lazy evaluation? I think GCs can also store the necessary information in their own data structures, so the objects don't need to hold that information
2021-07-19 11:45:31	audiocat	[04:38:33] can anyone help me debug? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68435141/why-would-15-20-minute-website-scrapes-work-at-first-but-after-a-couple-scrapes
2021-07-19 11:45:31	Izem	[04:40:26] beaky: Java, Go?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[04:49:40] i think java uses boxing for everything but through autoboxing makes it transparent
2021-07-19 11:45:31	arahael	[04:52:43] beaky: You can choose to use unboxed types if you really, really need to in Haskell.
2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[04:53:37] yes the goal is to use unboxed types for my tea database for maximum memory size efficiency
2021-07-19 11:45:31	arahael	[04:55:16] beaky: Beware I think if you manage to optimise your program so far that it no-longer allocates memory, it stops triggering the GC.  Which is probably fine, since you're not allocating.

2021-07-19 11:45:31	beaky	[05:01:42] hello my name is beaky
2021-07-19 11:45:31	mishugana	[05:02:02] Hi beaky
2021-07-19 11:45:31	deniska	[05:50:19] beaky: there's no need for garbage collection for an unboxed thing, either it's on a stack. or it's static
2021-07-19 11:45:31	arahael	[05:53:08] deniska: What stack?
2021-07-19 11:45:31	deniska	[05:55:33] arahael: a magic place for local variables and return addresses. Yeah, I know, sometimes it's registers

2021-07-19 12:51:14	beaky	so i have decided to cheat in agda and use haskell's native unboxed screaming-fast raw arrays through agda's haskell ffi but one problem is that by doing that the arrays will be completely opaque to agda so i cant compute with them
2021-07-19 12:51:43	beaky	but ive figured it out all arrays are isomorphic to product types
2021-07-19 12:52:34	beaky	so maybe using the power of cubical type theory i can combine the two and recover the same benefits of each
2021-07-19 12:52:57	beaky	compute in agda, but then compute even more compactly / efficiently once i compile to haskell

2021-07-19 14:26:16	nitrix	It's not exactly directed. The evaluation is, but as that happens, there are also effects bubbling up backwards, even though you're deep within the graph.
2021-07-19 14:26:41	nitrix	If the compiler can determine that it eventually reaches main, then you can observe the effects immediately.

2021-07-19 14:29:34	nitrix	Things like `putStrLn` will produce an `IO ()` that is conceptually is an I/O, printing to the terminal, and that gets eventually returned by `main` to the runtime which is how effects actually happens while keeping the language completely pure.

2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:33:17] i made DEL work as E, but i keep forgetting to usei t
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:33:33] muscle memory..
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:33:44] i also made \e quit insert mode
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:34:06] GeDaMo: write a plugin that randomly reassignes one key every 5 seconds
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:34:08] but i never use either the would-be escape or the would-be ESC
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:34:37] i wanted to write a text editor at some point
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:35:51] but it also quickly involves more than just text editing, would be sad not to have say regex
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:35:54] still need to write a new vi mode that operates on abstract syntax tree instead of text lines
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kzootech	[19:36:11] i think its kind of funny that ive been using vi/vim for about 25 years i would guess, my vimrc is 27 lines long including comments lol
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:36:30] my vimrc is mostly maps and abbrs iirc
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[19:36:55] nice i like vim
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[19:37:01] though i now use emacs
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:37:22] user51: adding regex is easy, one from libmusl is nice
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:37:41] user51: or structural regexps from plan9, I'm sure you can compile it as a library
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:37:59] pyzozord: i tried sam
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:38:11] user51: I never did, how was your experience?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kzootech	[19:38:16] http://codepad.org/WP2TQYJg the entirety of my vimrc after ~25 years lol
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:38:23] it blows. somehow it mixed up character based regex matching with a line-based editor
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kzootech	[19:38:25] its been longer in the past
2021-07-19 18:40:02	novns	[19:38:53] plan9 is hard to use because their bytes are 9 bits long
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:39:29] pyzozord: you should give it (and acme) a shot, but the mouse focus is really annoying
2021-07-19 18:40:02	novns	[19:39:35] and their bits have three states
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:39:37] i got carpal tunnel a day later
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:39:40] novns: good troll, I almost asked if that's really true
2021-07-19 18:40:02	GeDaMo	[19:39:57] "Implementing Regular Expressions" https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kzootech	[19:40:08] i was thinking "8 for extended ascii, 1 for parity"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:40:22] user51: yeah I'm not int o sam's mouse gesturing either. But that syntax seemed very cool
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[19:40:28] plan9 had native utf8
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:40:46] imo the main issue was that the 'line' boundary was broken
2021-07-19 18:40:02	novns	[19:40:53] well, the original definition of byte is "a set of any number of bits, usually 6"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:40:55] beaky: what is "native utf-8"?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kzootech	[19:41:11] how many characters per a line do you allow yourself?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[19:41:21] before plan9 everything assumed like ascii
2021-07-19 18:40:02	user51	[19:41:29] it's one of those cases where an interestin idea doesn't work well in practice because negative area is important
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[19:41:33] but then plan9 came with utf-8 they invented ti
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:41:50] beaky: ascii is utf-8, no?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:42:04] *a subset of
2021-07-19 18:40:02	novns	[19:42:16] kzootech, 8 for enlarged ascii, 1 for purity
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[19:42:19] yes but not all utf8 is ascii so the plan9 people were very careful to make sure everything was utf8
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[19:42:33] oh i see
2021-07-19 18:40:02	kzootech	[19:42:36] novns: lol a purity bit
2021-07-19 18:40:02	 *	Inhahe [19:43:02] wonders if novns means parity =4p

2021-07-19 18:40:02	novns	[19:45:11] pikapika, there

2021-07-19 18:40:02	pikapika	[19:45:36] novns, astronomer types need to know the true north
2021-07-19 18:40:02	novns	[19:46:46] pikapika, just stick to Z axis, it points to the north
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pikapika	[19:47:18] novns, I'll have to lay down the goddamn axes on the ground first though

2021-07-19 18:40:02	pikapika	[19:48:54] Its just an axis, you can point it anywhere

2021-07-19 18:40:02	Wafficus	[20:17:11] asking because I wanted to make an art gallery page, but didn't want to have to create a ton of <img /> tags

2021-07-19 18:40:02	lucf117	[20:30:52] yeah, you know, time just flyes. Suddenly I'm 32 yo. Time to find my first job and rent my own place maybe
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[20:31:29] lucf117: better later than never :P
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[20:32:14] sorry that was mean, and uncalled for. No idea what got into me
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[20:33:47] I guess I'm just surprised how one could survive up to that age without ever having to work
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[20:33:58] maybe a bit jelousy there
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:45:43] I'm 34 and never worked.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:45:45] (Don't ask.)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[20:46:20] trust fund baby?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[20:46:25] My first job was at 15.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:46:35] paulo_: No.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:46:43] I badly need a job.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[20:46:50] won the lottery?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[20:46:59] I see, how do you survive modern life?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:46:59] But when you're told you're not the right criteria to work at a supermarket, after a while, you more or less stop caring.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:47:20] I don't, really.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[20:47:36] I'm sorry to hear that, Jigsy. Is there maybe a way we can help?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:47:50] No. Besides, this is my problem, not yours. :P
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[20:48:14] My first computer-related job was at 18, building a 1998-era website.  It was a good upgrade from working in fast food.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[20:48:23] The whole concept of "helping" is based on other people's problems
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[20:48:47] So let us know if there's any way we can lend you a hand, Jigsy
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:49:00] I'll keep that in mind.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[20:49:26] Jigsy: Let's just say, if you ever want advice on job hunting or resume prep for programming jobs, I declare this a reasonable channel to raise such questions in.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[20:50:19] I second that, yes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[20:50:23] yeah this channel has always helped with my career questions
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[20:51:29] I'm nearning 30
2021-07-19 18:40:02	paulo_	[20:51:49] they say in every 30 year old is an 18 year old asking "where did all the time go?"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[20:51:51] It's not easy to know exactly how to do those things until you get on the inside.  So it's helpful to have a place to get answers to what works.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	 *	Jigsy [20:54:24] doesn't know any languages.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[20:54:28] Though I have briefly looked at Golang.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	edgar-rft	[20:57:32] Jigsy: congrats for typing english sentences without knowing the language
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[21:02:20] One has to start somewhere
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[21:02:49] I think I dived in at the deep end, though.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[21:03:58] If you want to learn to, I'm sure the channel will be able to advise you on the best way forward
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[21:04:07] Since I figured trying to code an IRCd would give me some motivation. But it's like "Okay, I need to store the connection. How do I do that?"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[21:04:16] Followed by? "Why is it calling the struct as a pointer?"
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Jigsy	[21:04:20] -?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[21:05:40] I don't work as a programmer myself. Learning by doing a project is always more motivating, but one has to manage difficulty too
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[21:05:56] I'm off to bed, but I look forward to reading everyone's suggestions
2021-07-19 18:40:02	dartmouthed	[21:06:23] Programming-related or otherwise
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:12:21] dartmouthed: the most difficult is to get the first job, each next employer will have much less doubts about you knowing that someone else already hired you in the past
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:13:10] I'm not sure but I am under impression that people who are looking to break into the programming job market nowadays look at people with 10 years experience on the market and say "I want a job like him!" right away
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:13:32] I started with programming job for close to minimum wage
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:14:01] And a pretty shitty boss
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[21:15:45] How's it going now?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:20:21] I have not been really worried about not being to find a job for at least 5 years
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:21:04] If I "lower my standards" I'm fairly certain I can find a job in two weeks at any moment
2021-07-19 18:40:02	whatsupboy	[21:21:09] 5 years?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	whatsupboy	[21:21:13] Thats so long
2021-07-19 18:40:02	whatsupboy	[21:21:20] how did you survive?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:21:44] ho no, i was not staying in a single company, i switched at least 4 times
2021-07-19 18:40:02	whatsupboy	[21:22:10] :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:24:01] I tend to stay 1-2 years in one place then move on. Reasons vary.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:26:42] That has pros and cons, I've seen a lot what people do and I think I have pretty good idea of what's "normal" more so than employees my age who stayed in a single company 4+ years. Also many chances to learn many things from many people. That's cool. On the bad side I don't have experience observing long term effects of my decisions or maintaing long term professional relationships
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:27:47] And people started looking suspecious on my CV recent years, seeing the clear 1-2 year pattern.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:28:25] But when they ask me I tell them honestly that if they will manage to keep my interest for more than 2 years I will stay more than 2 years.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[21:34:07] pyzozord: I don't think anyone on both sides knows what a entry level job looks like :P
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:36:01] Izem: Yeah. To be honest, it's been so long ago for me I started forgetting things.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:37:24] Other things have sunken into subconciousness and work as intuition now. Unfortunatelly people do not treat my intuition seriously, they want to be presented with strong arguments, which I cannot provied easily
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[21:39:15] that's good, improving inuition is great progress
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:48:35] I have a question. Is there a way to do "hot reloading" in C? Meaning changing parts of the program while the program is running?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:49:25] pyzozord: Technically yes, but it's not pretty.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:49:51] InPhase: how would that work in general terms?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:49:59] pyzozord: You have to pay attention to which portions of memory are marked executable if you want to dynamically execute new binary data that you generate on the fly.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:50:31] pyzozord: Essentially you're creating new machine code.  You can generate new machine code from C if you have a compiler integrated.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:51:55] pyzozord: Here's a Hello World demo of direct execution.  :)  https://wandbox.org/permlink/c7YPJoMCXCUCmdc3
2021-07-19 18:40:02	[R]	[21:52:01] pyzozord: SocketMud (the C version) has that feature, but it reloads the /entire/ thing, keeping some network state
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:52:08] That would be pretty cool. One could add the tcc, like they did in quake, they used tcc to compile their own "quake c" language
2021-07-19 18:40:02	[R]	[21:52:38] Also not sure how well it'd work on Windows
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:52:46] [R]: how did you know I was thinking about muds? :D
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[21:53:04] nice someone already wrote a database in rust https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb/blob/master/docs/references.md
2021-07-19 18:40:02	[R]	[21:53:06] I didn't
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:53:11] pyzozord: Note that if you redo that demo with the string literal as a dynamic array of any sort, it is going to crash on most platforms unless you tweak the execute permissions for those pages with some syscall.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:54:02] InPhase: nice, thanks!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:54:12] beaky: Are you making a rusty tea database?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	[R]	[21:54:33] pyzozord: basically how SocketMud does it, is it uses exec*() to call a new instance of itself in the same process space, some memory is not reset, so it can continue working, but if you do a major change to your memory or objects it's going to poop the bed pretty hard
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[21:54:35] pyzozord: you can do it in the visual c
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[21:54:41] but only for debugging
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:55:43] I was thinking also aobut using .so loaded dynamically, that could work right?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	[R]	[21:55:59] I think that's possible
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:56:08] pyzozord: Sure.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[21:56:28] I'm not sure what would happen if I unloaded old .so and loaded new .so during execution inside the old .so
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:58:46] pyzozord: You have dlopen, dlclose, and dlsym on Linux, which let you dynamically adjust what's loaded.  The symbols grabbed from dlsym can
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[21:59:01] be cast to the right function signature, and then called.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:00:16] would it be an over kill to have .so for each room, each item and each mob in the game? Like hunderds of thousends of .so files?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:00:57] Well it would probably make testing a serious pain.  :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[22:01:33] yes though not in rust i think i will make my tea database in agda
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:01:35] would it even be able to load itself into memory? It does sound like serious abuse of the dynamic linker/loader
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:01:59] pyzozord: I don't think you should unload something while it's executing.  That sounds like UB.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:02:26] But it would be easy to make a dynamic loading manager that switches rooms.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:02:43] Yeah I'd probably need to have some extra checks/registers/mutexes to check when execution is in or out of a .so
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:02:56] I question this as an architecture, as more standard would be to load data instead.  But there could be a use case for that sort of flexibility.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:03:50] I think here mostly of scripting but done in C and updated dynamically without taking the program down
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:04:10] Note that if you expect bugs in some of the room files, you instead want to do separate files in separate processes, and do some sort of IPC or localhost communication to interface.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:04:43] Then you would get "Room crashed, retreating to previous room" instead of just a hard crash.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:05:06] InPhase: actually I meant to ask, if I ran the dynamic parts in separate threads within the same process, if there would be a segfault in a thread like that, would it take down the main thread too?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:05:12] Yes.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:05:38] You use multiprocess approaches to avoid that.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:05:46] ah that's too bad, so they have to be separate processes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:07:05] ok I see, but that sounds like a big overkill to have a process for each monster and each item separately. I'd imagine few milion processes would need to be supported running at the same time (albeit in very extreme example when there is a player in each room in the game)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:07:37] but lets say the normal amount of processes would be around 100-500 * number of players
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:07:51] pyzozord: Now what can give you the best of both worlds, is embedding an interpreter, and using that for all your added features.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:08:02] pyzozord: You can recover from interpreter errors.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:08:18] yes, it does seem like I just made a full circle :D
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:09:09] Usually there's a reason all the other people came to the same conclusion you reach at the end of such an option evaluation.  ;)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	InPhase	[22:09:53] It sounds like it's for fun though, so go with what's fun.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[22:10:05] Yeah, that's a property of interpreted execution I haven't concidered carefully before
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[22:18:49] beaky: what benefit do you want to get from making the database in agda?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[22:19:49] with agda i get to specify everything with the full power of dependent types for instance if i were designing a query language i can directly specify and something like codd's theorem in agda
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[22:20:04] specify and prove something like codd's theorem*
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[22:22:26] hmm, don't you want to think about a query language after?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[22:22:50] you might want to use an existing query language
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[22:23:28] plus i get unicode mixfix support so i will get to ues all the sick unicode database operators like ⨝ or ▷
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[22:23:47] no i want to abandon sql
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[22:24:26] want about prolog?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[22:24:44] yes something more like prolog (or datalog) would be better
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[22:25:55] for all the reasons explained in this article https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql/
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[22:26:41] there's is also tutorial D from the third manifesto, but I have never looked into it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[22:26:53] unicode support is nice
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[22:27:17] meh I'm tired of blog posts at this point
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[22:28:03] yes it is a very long blog post but it carefully explains almost everything i dont like about sql
2021-07-19 18:40:02	smallville7123	[22:28:34] god damn i wish my transfer speeds where this high
2021-07-19 18:40:02	smallville7123	[22:28:35] Documents/sticker5.jpg: 1 file pushed, 0 skipped. 571.3 MB/s (237199 bytes in 0.000s)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[23:00:52] yes the sick transfer speeds of in ram copying
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetoric	[23:34:29] After an al day search, I've found what I was looking for. A queue that creates batches of size n (you define n) and that timeouts and flushes after m [unit] where unit can be as low as nanoseconds. https://github.com/fulmicotone/io.fulmicotone.fqueue
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetoric	[23:36:40] I'd almost like to say we should have a producer/consumer pattern with a batching producer that creates batches of n messages or flushes after m [time unit]

2021-07-19 18:40:02	eyynet4	[00:54:35] is that real blinky hardware or rendered?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[00:55:53] normalization in cubical type theory how they proved it correct one of the biggest theoretical hurdles in cubical type theory solved https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7EuLw9E8A8
2021-07-19 18:40:02	eyynet4	[00:56:35] whats a cubic type
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[00:57:49] cubical type theory is a type theory where the identity types are represented via cubical sets through intervals and path types
2021-07-19 18:40:02	eyynet4	[00:58:12] it really bothers me that the "FWD" is on left, and "RVS" is on right. forward / reverse?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	eyynet4	[00:59:35] i have no idea what that means :(

2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[03:21:32] yes naming things is one of the more difficult tasks involved in programming
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Powerhouse6666	[03:44:26] any ideas why only one of the paypal buttons are showing on the page? https://termbin.com/hgf8

2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[04:23:41] are there garbage-collected programming languages that do not box everything by default like haskell does for data types
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[04:24:32] where everything is unboxed, even user-defined data, and even polymorphic data (which gets 'monomorphized' lke in rust) and only that which necessarily requires boxing like existential types gets boxed
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[04:26:27] but then how would garbage collection work in such a programmming language where one important point of boxing is to provide metadata for the gc
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pavonia	[04:38:13] beaky: Are you sure GC is the reason for boxing in Haskell and not lazy evaluation? I think GCs can also store the necessary information in their own data structures, so the objects don't need to hold that information
2021-07-19 18:40:02	audiocat	[04:38:33] can anyone help me debug? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68435141/why-would-15-20-minute-website-scrapes-work-at-first-but-after-a-couple-scrapes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Izem	[04:40:26] beaky: Java, Go?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[04:49:40] i think java uses boxing for everything but through autoboxing makes it transparent
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[04:52:43] beaky: You can choose to use unboxed types if you really, really need to in Haskell.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[04:53:37] yes the goal is to use unboxed types for my tea database for maximum memory size efficiency
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[04:55:16] beaky: Beware I think if you manage to optimise your program so far that it no-longer allocates memory, it stops triggering the GC.  Which is probably fine, since you're not allocating.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mishugana	[05:01:25] Hello
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mishugana	[05:01:38] (Sorry, was just testing)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[05:01:42] hello my name is beaky
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mishugana	[05:02:02] Hi beaky
2021-07-19 18:40:02	deniska	[05:50:19] beaky: there's no need for garbage collection for an unboxed thing, either it's on a stack. or it's static
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[05:53:08] deniska: What stack?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	deniska	[05:55:33] arahael: a magic place for local variables and return addresses. Yeah, I know, sometimes it's registers
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[07:21:13] so i have decided to cheat in agda and use haskell's native unboxed screaming-fast raw arrays through agda's haskell ffi but one problem is that by doing that the arrays will be completely opaque to agda so i cant compute with them
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[07:21:43] but ive figured it out all arrays are isomorphic to product types
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[07:22:34] so maybe using the power of cubical type theory i can combine the two and recover the same benefits of each
2021-07-19 18:40:02	beaky	[07:22:57] compute in agda, but then compute even more compactly / efficiently once i compile to haskell
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[07:44:37] deniska: What return addresses? ;)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[07:44:43] deniska: Haskell uses graph reduction.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	deniska	[07:48:12] weirdos
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[07:49:33] So there's no call stack either. :D  Although there are ways of adding in that information for specific calls if required.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[08:13:00] deniska: lol :D
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[08:14:08] The more I hear about haskell the stranger it becomes. No call stack, a graph instead... Can't even imagine how that would work
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:19:59] The program is a graph. You start at the root and lazily evaluate the branches that you need to compute your node.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:20:25] Nodes that are shared can be memorized and their results re-used.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	davros	[08:22:01] ah the name.. "stackless g machine", thats what it means
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[08:23:16] does it mean that every vertex can be connected with every other vertex theoretically?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	davros	[08:41:00] must be some restriction (DAG i think?)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	davros	[08:41:14] "results can be re-used" = DAG.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:46:41] pyzozord, Yes and even themselves. For example, `let x = 1 : x in x` is an infinite list of 1s, since it's defined as 1 concatenated to itself.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:47:01] pyzozord, That's known as "tying the knot".
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:47:48] It's one of the ways to achieve recursive data structures despite having immutable data.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:56:16] It's not exactly directed. The evaluation is, but as that happens, there are also effects bubbling up backwards, even though you're deep within the graph.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:56:41] If the compiler can determine that it eventually reaches main, then you can observe the effects immediately.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:59:34] Things like `putStrLn` will produce an `IO ()` that is conceptually is an I/O, printing to the terminal, and that gets eventually returned by `main` to the runtime which is how effects actually happens while keeping the language completely pure.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[08:59:55] But `putStrLn` will print immediately when it's evaluated, not when it reaches `main`.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:00:35] nitrix actually that is not true. evaluating putStrLn "Hello, World" won't print anything
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:01:29] you can check this in ghci, putStrLn "Hello, World" `seq` 10
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:01:52] You're confusing laziness with evaluation.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:02:10] The evaluation can be lazy or strict, it's still evaluated.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:02:12] no, I am not. see documentation for seq
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:02:48] seq is used above specifically to force evaluation of IO () returned by putStrLn
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:03:33] that's the reason why haskell is purely functional, because evaluating IO actions doesn't do anything
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[09:03:46] nitrix: oh, very interesting
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:04:07] they are inert values, until you link them to main, which is then executed by the runtime
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:04:32] I think you don't really know me if you're trying to teach me how Haskell is working, lol.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:04:36] Do your homework a little bit ;)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:05:17] nitrix, I think you should do your homework if you think evaluating IO () executes that action.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:07:35] That happens with chitchat layman conversations that are meant to be taken with a grain of salt.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:08:04] nitrix, you don't even know what seq does
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:08:11] nitrix, and you call me a layman?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:08:16] how about we take this to #haskell?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:08:56] I propose you #ghc since I'm a contributor, lol.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:09:28] you contribute to ghc, and you don't know what seq does?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:09:30] And it wont change what transpired. Good catch for the slip, but you're still not going to tell me to read the `seq` documentation when I could've practically written it myself.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:09:33] Jackass.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:09:57] that wasn't a slip, you have fundamental misunderstanding how actions work in haskell
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:09:58] Now get off the elitism ladder.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:10:15] as they say, you know you lost the argument when the insults start
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:10:42] Yeah yeah, keep whining.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[09:10:58] hey, calm down you two!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:11:00] the only one whining is you
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:11:05] If I wanted to be pedantic I'd be in #haskell, not chitchatting in ##programming.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:12:35] I was supposed to get back to the graph thing and completely lost that train of thought.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:13:04] nitrix, that wasn't me being pedantic, but correcting something that was fundamentally incorrect and wrong. anyway, no point in continuing this further, since you admitted you were wrong. (though apologize would be more appropriate when you realized you were wrong, instead of continuing with the insults)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:13:08] pyzozord, I guess that conversation will continue another day.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:13:14] apologizing*
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:13:58] I admit I slipped, but the patronizing with the documentation is plain insulting.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:14:12] So tune it down a little.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:14:55] that wasn't patronization. you talked about haskell being lazy, and that being the reason why it wasn't printing, even though I used seq. so it was reasonable to assume that you don't know what seq does
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:15:54] Go lookup any #haskell-beginners logs to find out how much time I spent in the past 7 years willingly teaching Haskell and doing a very competent job at it before you start with the elitism bullshit.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:16:46] I've giving much more to that community to receive crap the moment I do a single mistake after not using the language for 3 years.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:16:50] perhaps you shouldn't try helping newbies, when you have such a fundamental misunderstanding of the language. I'd expect even a more advanced beginner to know that evaluation IO action doesn't execute it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[09:17:04] what IO is - a monad - and how it is actually implemented has always been a bit different in the name of efficiency.  but i think you two need to grab a coffee or a break or something, as you two have ...  ok, lars8, please stop it.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[09:17:22] you two are just riling each other on at the moment.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:18:25] I was done 10 minutes ago, but he refuses to back down, so here we are
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:18:33] obviously an ego problem
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[09:18:35] lars8: it takes two to tango.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:18:41] Because you butted in a conversation for which the thing you're nitpicking at doesn't matter.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:19:05] no, that's not nitpicking. understanding this is fundamental part of haskell
2021-07-19 18:40:02	lars8	[09:19:25] this is public forum. if you don't want your bullshit to be corrected, then don't participate in it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[09:19:36] !q lars8 please be less confrontive
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[09:20:39] nitrix: sorry, not following the full convo, need to pretend I'm working a bit ;)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:21:29] Yeah and I'm gonna take a breather. Never seen a Haskeller so riled up, you'd almost think this is #c.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[09:21:30] nitrix: let me read throught the logs in like 10-30 minutes
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[09:23:17] I think that "layman" was about me. And I am an utter layman when it comes to haskell :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:24:51] Anyway, where I wanted to get at is that the graph isn't entire directed. The evaluation is, but then that results in actions that can be executed at ulterior points in the graph, due to the lazy evaluation.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	nitrix	[09:31:23] Then, the part that I blurted out, is that the runtime is capable of strictly evaluating things when sequencing of IO is required, effectively interleaving evaluation and actions. Without it you couldn't have interactive programs receiving inputs while producing outputs.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	 *	nitrix [09:33:57] afk
2021-07-19 18:40:02	node1	[09:55:06] In python, we say `instances of first argument` I believe it's refering itself i.e `self` ?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	GeDaMo	[09:56:13] when you write obj.method(x) that gets translated to method(obj, x)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	GeDaMo	[09:56:30] With obj being the 'self' parameter
2021-07-19 18:40:02	node1	[09:56:49] yes self is refers object or instance of a class here
2021-07-19 18:40:02	node1	[09:57:09] GeDaMo, Thanks :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	node1	[09:57:48] Or first argument. i.e obj
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[10:18:44] among the benefits of functional programming, which one is worth applying to the imperative world? I feel an improvement separating effects and pure logic, but I'm not seeing (yet) the eureka of applying monads where effects are present. What do you think?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:00:45] arkanoid: You can do imperative programming in Haskell (just do everything in IO).
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:02:24] arkanoid: However, I feel that the main benefit is that you can pretty much expect that functions have *no* side effects, which makes it much easier to reason.  A given input has a given output, and all that.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pikapika	[11:05:25] arahael, hi
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:07:19] pikapika: Hello!
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pikapika	[11:07:26] Hi uwu
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:10:52] arahael: I know imperative world can bend to pure functional, but I don't think it's the other way around. An haskell program that does everything with IO and monads is not like the imperative version
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:12:17] arkanoid: With 'do-notation', haskell code can look very imperative.  However, at work I do functional programming all the time in imperative languages - including in Swift.  And it's always annoying me because unlike Haskell, I'm always having to think about side effects.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:13:20] arkanoid: When I'm doing "map" operations, as an example, or I have what is basically a pipeline, I have to always be conscious that it is possible that there are side effects.  Eg, maybe even the values I'm getting represent the same object and are thus mutable.  In Haskell, I can pretty much always assume and expect that it is never going to have side effects.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:14:00] arahael: I'm on the same boat, luckily I'm a one-man-team and I can pick an imperative language that can help me with that (currently Nim language)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:14:29] you can enforce no side effects and no exception raised in a function
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:16:09] arkanoid: I'm not familiar with Nim, but being able to enforce that all your functions have no side effects would go a long way.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:16:50] not really, just declare your function with "func" instead of "proc" and program won't compile if purity is not assested
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:17:28] well, actually you have to add a couple of other things if you also want to assest the absence of exception
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:19:00] arkanoid: From a brief reading about nim, I think you can still altar the objects that are passed in to a no side-effect function?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:22:30] arahael: no, you can't, except if you explicitly declare it in the signature of the func
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:23:03] all passed arguments are immutable by default, except when declared "var" in function signature
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:23:09] I would guess that no-side-effect functions can't call any functions that have side effects either?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:24:52] arahael: exactly. Compiler tracks effects and can automatically tag functions according to absence of effects or not, so declaring a function with no side effects blocks the compilation all down the call stack from that point
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:25:38] arkanoid: Nice.  Does Nim also have sum types?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:26:14] arkanoid, still, func alone doesn't guarantee purity, you can mutate variables declared with var
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:26:30] s/variables/passed arguments
2021-07-19 18:40:02	gggp_	[11:27:07] why the consensus algorithm need a leader election ?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:27:13] xsperry: https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual_experimental.html#strict-funcs
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pyzozord	[11:27:46] Omg just had a brilliant idea. I'm collecting links to articles and websites about programming, that are of high quality and I might find useful in the future. But some of them are old and I already ran into few cases where the website was gone. I shall integrate with archive.org to make sure my links have a safe copy! :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:28:10] arahael: kinda, it has variant objects https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-object-variants
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:28:27] arkanoid, doesn't that just repeat what I have said? you can mutate argument declared with var
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:30:00] xsperry: To be fair, you can do the same in Haskell (if, eg, an argument is passed as an IORef in a function that operates in IO).
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:30:04] xsperry: exacly, it was to confirm that. If you explicitly declare an argument as mutable, you can modify it. That's not the default, and can also be tracked with diagnostics
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:30:37] arkanoid: In Nim, are you able to sidestep this, and tell the compiler to pretend that a function has no side effects? (eg, to log something)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:30:45] arahael, you can't do that in a non-IO function. so it is treated the same as any other side effect
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:31:41] xsperry: Yeah - and in Haskell, you can't lie to the compiler and do it anyway. It's technically possible, but that way is true madness.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:32:04] arahael: sure. debugEcho does exactly that, check the source link too https://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#debugEcho%2Cvarargs%5Btyped%2C%5D
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:32:09] In most other "functional" languages, I find that people often put in these 'not-quite-pure' functions and it all works fine, which then means you're back to having to reason about side effects.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:32:23] arkanoid: So, if debugEcho can do that, what happens if it has a side effect?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:34:21] are you asking if the language will do what the programmer want outside the default defensive semantics? Yes, it will compile and run, and possibly deal with IO errors
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:34:44] arkanoid: In Haskell, you basically don't take the escape hatch, because it's insane.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:35:30] arkanoid: In addition, a function is required to return the same output for the given input.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:35:55] arahael: yes, it's a risk, I do understand that, but you can track it (after lisp, nim is one of the top language for metaprogramming)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:36:09] arkanoid: Yeah - the reason in haskell that it's insane, is because you can't track it. :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:37:16] I think the issue isn't just that you can mutate the argument, but that it can be read as well (since the value could change between two invocations of that function). in haskell, a non-IO function that accepts IO Ref can't do anything with the refeference, other than return it
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:38:24] And I reckon this is what makes it so nice as a functional language - it makes it really really predictable.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:38:49] I don't know anything about Nim besides what I googled in the past few minutes, but some of this is addressed in here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nim/comments/fuoiw1/nim_functions_are_not_pure/
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:42:08] xsperry: just by looking at the function signature, you can tell which effects or exceptions it may have. You have escape hatches, you can track them. If you don't use them lack of side effects is guaranteed by the compiler
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:42:56] question is: is better to have escape hatches and way to track them, or don't have them?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:43:19] arkanoid: Imho, much better not to have them, and not to need them. :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:44:57] arahael: sure, but it is impossible :D even in haskell, you have to deal with them somehow on the edge
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:45:05] monad all the way down
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:46:06] arkanoid: Monads all the way down is good. :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:46:07] arahael I wouldn't go that far. even haskell has unsafePerformIO, and some things would be impossible without it. again, I don't have any experience with Nim, and what it is doing certainly seems better than completely unrestricted side effects, I just have a bit of an issue calling something noSideEffect that has them
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:46:44] xsperry: Sure, but I think most of the time, if you're doing unsafePerformIO, you're probably a bit insane. :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:47:27] unless you have someone who hijacks your functions signatures by adding "var" before arguments and adding some mutable login inside, you're safe
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:47:30] xsperry: Then again, ByteString is pretty good, and that does do some pretty unspeakable things under the hood, but that's...    Unspeakable. :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:47:32] I have used it once or twice in the couple of years I've used haskell. so not nearly as much as I'd expected a typical Nim user using var
2021-07-19 18:40:02	xsperry	[11:48:39] and it was pretty innocent, just as a way to have top-level mutable reference. ie ref = unsafePerformIO (newIORef ...)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:49:25] xsperry: I don't know enough haskell to know if that's insane or not. :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:52:26] Still, Nim sounds reasonable.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[11:52:54] Especially given that Nim seems to allow writing closures that do not have side effects (except for var function arguments)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:55:51] arahael: exactly, the non top-level functions gets "clousure" calling convention and can be enforced just like other functions
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:59:17] btw, original question was about a different topic
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[11:59:30] would you take monads into imperative programming?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[12:00:36] I've already developed some Maybe, List, Either monads in nim, including >>= infix, so code like "Maybe(5) >>= div(0)" make sense now
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[12:01:02] but yet not sure if on the edge I should still prefer exceptions
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[12:01:56] Yeah, that I don't know.  I mean, Monads are pretty good in haskell, but I don't know how nice they are in say, Nim.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arkanoid	[12:03:20] I should study haskell more to know how they feel there
2021-07-19 18:40:02	arahael	[12:15:45] Perhaps. :)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	 *	arahael [12:15:58] is a bit of a Haskell fan at the moment, however.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:17:58] i like my programming languages same as i like my coffee
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:18:00] with side effects
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mspe	[12:18:30] dark and punching me in the stomach
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:18:41] ^
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:26:49] how do you get damn good at programming one specific type of software system?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	jeronimo	[12:27:33] I guess
2021-07-19 18:40:02	jeronimo	[12:27:39] the answer is very simple
2021-07-19 18:40:02	jeronimo	[12:27:44] and if you dont know the answer
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:27:59] is it by learning design patterns from the code of all guys who wrote such systems before?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:28:24] simplistic mindset is stupid
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:28:46] because it is not actionable
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:29:13] realistically, some system needs to get coded and it should be better (for example in performance)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:30:21] design patterns aren't only Gamma et al. Every type of system has some common patterns of code for that type of system...
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:31:37] so, where do you get the highest performing publish subscribe Java implementation in the world?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:36:47] generally speaking
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:36:48] is it LMAX disruptor? https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Performance-Results
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:36:54] to get good at programming X, implement X a dozen or so times
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:37:06] no, that is stupid and wrong
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:37:23] will you code LMAX disruptor by implementing publish/subsrcibe a dozen or so times, pulse? https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Performance-Results
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:38:08] i don't even have a clue what that is
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:38:39] but whatever it is i'm pretty sure it can be implemented a dozen times over
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:39:03] hahah, you don't have a clue what that is
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:39:15] if you want to draw a tree well, draw it 100 times
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:39:29] that's why implementing publish/subscribe a dozen times doesn't magically give you LMAX disruptor
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Hylden	[12:40:02] Hello. I know some general programming and have done some basic graphics work, but can someone recommend me some good resources on reverse engineering video games? Like extracting textures and such?
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:40:42] Hylden, subcultures of reverse engineering can often be found within the modding communities
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:40:58] you might want to choose a specific game and see what they're doing
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:41:20] for most games you can just google how to extract textures, especially if they use a common engine
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Hylden	[12:41:34] pulse: this specific video game that I'm thinking of remastering a bit isn't popular
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:42:02] see this article for an idea of how it's done https://trashworldnews.com/yoda-stories/
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:42:06] it's a pretty good article
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:42:15] not sure if you're familiar with the game though
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Hylden	[12:42:22] Thanks
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:42:45] Hylden if you want something practical, download format analyzers and figure out what compression algorithm the data format uses, then decompress it.
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:43:20] if the game uses unknown format, you usually have to do a bit of detective work
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:43:30] Hylden if you want something even more practical, download an "extractor" software that analyzes automatically a big file for multiple binary smallers files for thousands of different compression algorithms and tries to extract files from it (bitmaps, or sprites, etc.)
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:43:59] Hylden I've used https://sourceforge.net/projects/gameextractor/ in the past
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Hylden	[12:44:48] mathAndRhetorics: awesome, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Hylden	[12:44:52] Thanks
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Hylden	[12:46:08] Wait a minute, this is a java app
2021-07-19 18:40:02	Hylden	[12:46:52] Anyway, thanks for the answers, guys
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:47:50] there are also commrecial apps for that, but he's already quit (knowing he needs a game extractor) - http://www.watto.org/game_extractor.html
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:48:31] so what is a LMAX disruptor mathAndRhetorics
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:48:43] sounds like a device from star trek
2021-07-19 18:40:02	mathAndRhetorics	[12:48:47] anyway, the basic concept for messaging is producer/consumer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem and the highest performing framework in Java I know of is https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Introduction
2021-07-19 18:40:02	pulse	[12:48:58] "quick sir, get the LMAX disruptor before the aliens breach!"

2021-07-19 19:31:51	Quietwalker	Right.  But when folks want to denigrate black people, without saying "black," they call them "urban" instead.
2021-07-19 19:32:24	Quietwalker	I just don't know what any definition of urban has to do with anything about the web.
2021-07-19 19:32:30	deniska	pyzozord: this is a provocation. You can easily write html1.0-ish page which will render fine in any browser new and old

2021-07-19 19:36:08	Quietwalker	which in the *nix days was a pain because who wants to run a graphical terminal just so you can read  text?

2021-07-19 19:36:36	Quietwalker	if you weren't running xwindows, you'd just put it through a ps->pdf converter and read it on a windows or other machine.
2021-07-19 19:37:05	Quietwalker	and half the ps refused to properly render anyway because someone used some random feature

2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:49:30] haha xD
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[17:50:47] I need to do more both depth and breadth learning
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:51:00] how do you do that?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[17:51:25] i wouldn't know - that's why I need to do more of it :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[17:51:54] i prefer dfs
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[17:52:21] dfs first search :)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[17:53:35] like study data structures and compilers indepth but also like learn a new language briefly once avery few weeks
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:53:46] oh
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:54:01] that's usually done in a pl book
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[17:54:12] i tried reading about alogirthms
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[17:54:31] they kinda don't make any sense to me at first, but after a while you learn
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:54:32] the one's from the 80s and 90s would discuss 4-5 languages
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:54:48] not sure if that's the focus from the newer ones
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[17:54:59] stuff like mergesort is pretty intuitive to me nowdays
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:55:29] as for data structures, there is the compiler approach like wirth, or just have it be completely seperate
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:55:50] I would like to do more data strcutures as well, but to be honest you only need a few
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[17:56:10] i'd still look it up though, just in case. sometimes i wonder if a sort function hides multiple functions inside and chooses one depending on the amount of data to sort
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[17:57:11] for me dijkstra is intuitive, dont really understand why people are intimidated by it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:57:35] the algorithm?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[17:57:40] fwiw a lot of my experience is just hands on stuf
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[17:57:49] the biggest part of it is the piority queue, and that's done with the binary heap, and i dont remember those thing it does with bubble up and sink down or whatever
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[17:57:55] but otherwise it quite simple
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[17:58:08] i am very likely to fail a lot of actual implementations, but speaking about them theoretically makes sense to me nowdays
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[17:59:24] interestingly enough how you implement data structures is kinda limited by more abstract languages
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:00:04] abstractions are.. dunno how to say it, make hard things easy but easy things hard?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[18:00:31] can you do data strucutres in assembly?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:00:47] you're right, i used the wrong idiom
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[18:01:00] user51: they make poking about the computer more difficult
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:01:02] assembly is kinda interesting sometimes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:01:34] in a sense that you have little programs connected to the larger one
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:02:35] in essense you could argue that many languages apply but the structure of asm makes it much easier to see
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:03:07] damn, i just made a shift-reduce conflict in the last two messages
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:04:51] are C++ coroutines "alright", or are there any signifiicant gotchas, let's say performance-wise?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	TheRedRipper	[18:05:26] µµ
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[18:06:13] koo6: why would there be?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:06:50] maybethe implementations (gcc, llvm) could still be immature? idk
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:07:08] just figured i'd fish around before diving into them
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Izem	[18:07:49] that's just weird tbh
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:08:46] oh well
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:10:55] Oh that reminds me. I started the subject yesterday, but I have more questions. Is it possible to write C code that that if crashes instead of stopping the program it just jumps to some other instruction? I know that programs: segment fault, stack overflow, divide by 0. I guess there are other reasons why program crash. But if I'm not mistaken they are all just handled as os signals. So it seems
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:11:01] reasonable that I had my own handlers for those signals that do not stop execution. Essentially a try/catach
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:12:02] I wanted that so that I can safely run .so code without crashing my main program
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:12:31] pyzozord: it depends on what "crash" means
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:12:52] i wouldn't call that safe
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:12:55] pyzozord: most "crashes" are caused because you did some bad thing in C that was unrecoverable (like accessing memory you were not allowed) and it's the OS that killed you, not the C program choosing to quit
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:13:26] https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_signal_handling.htm
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Guest2949	[18:13:26] pyzozordI think you may be able to use setjmp and longjmp to handle that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:13:48] Guest2949: yeah I was thinking about longjmp too
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:14:19] bjs: is it that os kills you or os sends you signal "hey, chill" and kills you if you don't?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[18:14:48] straight up killin ur process
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:15:06] pyzozord: it depends.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:15:28] pyzozord: some things are signals you can handle and jump out of (although, exactly what state the machine is in at that point is unclear, especially for a C program)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:15:59] some things are straight-up killed without the OS even asking first (e.g. OOM is typically this)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Guest2949	[18:16:06] Hmmm
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:16:15] bjs: what else kills you?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Guest2949	[18:16:17] That's a good point.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	Guest2949	[18:16:23] LOL pyzozord
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:16:54] pyzozord: well the OS can send signals like SIGSEGV and SIGILL when the process does a "bad" thing
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[18:17:17] yes i like sigbus too i imagine a bus coming a stopping by
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:17:19] bjs: so I can't not die when I get segv?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:18:40] pyzozord: you can keep the process alive (sometimes) but like I said, and especially when it's a C program, the state of the machine is often very unclear
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[18:18:46] you can handle it and not die i think but sigkill in particular is where u get striaght'up killed (its what the out of memory killer thing does)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[18:19:19] or if you use kill -9 the only kill command everyone uses
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[18:19:24] because nobody uses sigstop
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:19:44] that's fine when they want me dead I should die
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[18:19:46] or sigterm to ask the process nicely to stop (thats the one you can handle)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:19:51] I just don't wanna die because of internal problems
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:19:55] pyzozord: imagine you `*x = 1; read(*y)`  now if you get a SIGSEGV on reading y, you might think that the write of x already happened but that's not probably not true. and infact the entire state could just be a total mess
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:20:13] probably not true*
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:20:46] bjs: yeah I get that part I think that's not a problem
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[18:20:51] yes with signals it might not be possible to decide causality that u might be looking for
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:22:20] i would want to do something like setjmp(); if (do_unsafe_so_stuff()) { /*jump here if so crashed us*/ handle_error } all_cool_here_carry_on()
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:22:59] im probably using setjmp wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:24:28] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10202941/segmentation-fault-handling
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:24:53] pyzozord: the most robust way is usually to do the unsafe library stuff in a separate process, maybe mmap some space so it can give you back data
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:25:02] it really seems to be retying the instruction .. interesting
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:25:06] and if it goes wrong then you can just discard the space and drop the process and
2021-07-20 10:40:19	koo6	[18:25:14] ^
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:25:18] oh hmm nice idea
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:25:24] c syntax can be fun tho
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:25:26] just unsafe process
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:25:51] *(pointer = &var) = something(&pointer)[0];
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:25:58] unsafe so server process
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:26:22] could do parallelism that way too
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:28:02] user51: Pretty sure that's UB.  :)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:28:16] InPhase: really? didn't know
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:28:33] user51: Assignment is not a sequence point, so the order is not specified for left and right there.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:29:15] how does c++ implement the try/catch stuff
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:29:17] user51: It's left undefined for optimization purposes, but that slams it into UB if you modify something used on the other side.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:29:29] will it even catch segfaults and divisions by zero?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:29:37] undefined foreign optimization
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:30:37] InPhase: my thought process was that the rightmost side gets evaluated first, then the resulting value is assigned
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:30:38] pyzozord: it does checks before you do certain operations, and if you do a bad thing it walks up the stack to find a try/catch and it stores a bit of information on the stack that lets it walk back up
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:30:39] pyzozord: Officially in C++, no.  But you can setup signal handlers on an implementation-specific basis that convert those signals into exception throws.  I've done this for segfault logging.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:32:04] pyzozord: It's pretty nice to get a stack trace report out of release builds of C++ for a segfault.  It just requires platform-specific code.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	user51	[18:32:33] i wonder if enron would have liked undefined behavior
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:33:05] pyzozord: it's basically entirely a software thing,  the software does checks, creates an exception object and then walks the stack to find a catch that matches it and if it does, it pops off and jumps there to continue. No OS signals or anything involved
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:34:00] bjs: I see so those are just runtime checks injected by c++
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:34:13] InPhase: ok so that sounds almost perfect
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:34:23] (except I prefer c instead of c++)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:35:01] pyzozord: Yes.  Standard exceptions are basically just code insertion like bjs said.  What it's about is cleaning up the code so that code is focused on the positive-path and is much cleaner.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:35:23] ok so sounds like that idea of set a jump, do unsafe code, if it triggers a segv, handle the segv, in the segv do the longjmp
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:35:26] will work, right?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:35:32] pyzozord: Also there's the important benefit that exceptions guarantee errors are handled somewhere.  Errors do not get ignored.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:35:37] pyzozord: saying it will "work" might be going far
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:35:41] it won't immediately kill the process
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:35:46] pyzozord: Many many many C bugs are due to missed or skipped error checking.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:35:59] in very many cases you're likely to just get another SIGV immediately after
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:36:44] pyzozord: In any large C++ program intended to be robust, you assume exceptions will happen, and you put catch-all handlers at opportune recovery points to deal with this in a useful manner.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:37:20] pyzozord: Then for the ones you can handle locally with a better recovery, you add an additional catch.  But your catch-alls handle everything else, and you end up dealing with every error in some useful way.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:37:39] not convinced programs with catch-all handlers can claim to be robust, tbh
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:37:50] edk: More robust than the ones without this!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:37:57] that's debatable
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:38:09] if the exception isn't caught you'll at least know they went wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:38:32] edk: Here's a simple program structure:  You push buttons to do stuff.  A catch-all should report, "That button press didn't work because:  ____"  Then return to where you can try another button press.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:38:39] InPhase: to provide context, that still the continuation of the idea from yesterday. I imagine a MUD game where I can create a new "script.so" and then assign it to some object in the running game. The game will then load the script.so, and execute it depending on the game logic. Whever the game executes something from the so I want to have that safety even if the script.so segvs, it doesn't take
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:38:45] down the entire game with it, the game just handles it somehow, forexample unloading the .so and logging the error somewhere
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:39:06] InPhase: right, but for all you know the button press did half of something
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:39:42] maybe it's rotated an x-ray target out of the way but not switched off a power circuit
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:39:44] edk: If you used scope-based resource management with a structure that planned ahead for exceptions, that will all be handled automatically at the stack unwinding.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:40:02] resource management will be. you can't manage state that way
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:40:10] edk: Scope-based resource management should be comprehensive throughout the program design.  Exception handling is central to architecture, and not an afterthought.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:40:28] edk: a C program probably literally cannot claim such a thing
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:40:36] a Python program probably could be robust in such errors :)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:40:53] i claim python is equivalent in robustness to C
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:41:06] edk: If you're used to C programming, then this sort of recovery during unwinding is unthinkable.  But designing FOR it in C++ makes it straightforward.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:41:16] edk: C's UB means you cannot recover at all though
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:41:20] all I'm really hoping for to get the kind of robustness python has in C
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:41:26] whereas in Python you theoretically could, depending on the circumstances
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:42:09] if something goes horribly wrong then so be it, but I think I never really experienced anything else then stack overflows and segmentation faults my entire life
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:42:16] once you've triggered UB you're screwed but i'm not convinced you can meaningfully recover from logic errors anyway, all python (or rust)-style safety gives you is more guarantees about the consequences of those errors
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:42:23] bjs: Python is a little trickier to recover from errors with catch-alls because you don't get deterministic destruction.  So you have to be more careful with state recovery, and include more catches.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:42:26] it can't protect the state of your program
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:42:46] 'course, rust also gives you better tools to avoid those errors than either of the other two
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:42:48] InPhase: well it's the other way around surely, if you have a C program with UB you *cannot* recover
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:42:53] there is literally no way in C to get out of UB
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:43:00] Exceptions are not for handling UB.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:43:08] InPhase: i feel like you're in write-only mode
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:43:23] InPhase: okay but handling UB is basically what pyzozord is trying to do
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:43:23] Exceptions CAN handle logic errors, data quality errors, and hardware errors just fine though.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:43:52] everything you've said is about resource management, which is fine, but doesn't encapsulate everything programs need to be consistent about
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:44:25] And I volunteered that I've mapped segfaults to exceptions before.  But I only do that for logging and reporting purposes.  I treat segfault exceptions as fatal errors when I do this, because you really can't trust program state after you've allowed UB to occur.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:44:30] if i'm halfway through changing the state of a system and i throw an exception, there's no amount of raii that can help
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:45:04] edk: I mean it depends on the system :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:45:16] imagine you screw up an IRC server, you can just delete the database for example :D
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:45:39] well in general, that system needs to be reset to a consistent state, and in order to know to reset the system in question you needed to expect me to throw an exception while mutating it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:45:48] a catchall higher up won't do
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:46:01] You can do a best-effort unwind, but it's unwise to continue even if you've caught and handled a segfault.  Probably 9 times out of 10 you really could recover in practice, but I wouldn't trust it.  I might attempt differently if lives were on the line for a program crash.  But it's not something you can rely on.  Regular exceptions can be implemented in a completely reliable manner with full trust
2021-07-20 10:40:19	InPhase	[18:46:07] in the unwind and recovery.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:47:07] edk: sure but the difference between Python and C is that Python lets you see that something went wrong and attempt to do something about it. You may not be able in all cases to get back to where you were exactly, but Python at least will allow you to try. My database example is a bit tongue-in-cheek but certainly is an example
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:48:06] and there are various ways of doing checkpointing so that you can "recover" back to a previous consistent state. The point I'm making is that a single C program just cannot do that if there's UB, at least not in a way that also isn't just UB itself ;)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:48:18] bjs: right, but catching specific errors in python is, from some angles, equivalent to "don't make mistakes" in C, which is to say inadequate
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:49:39] edk: no it's not the same,  in C the compiler is allowed to just assume SIGSEGV never happens, it could detect your SIGSEGV handler and NOP it out, it could delete 1/2 your program.  The Python program would at least guarantee you hit an exception handler and be in a consistent state (that is, a consistent *interpreter* state) from which you can actually execute new code reliably
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:49:46] exceptions because of exceptional conditions are something else; they're doing what you do with return values in C. which leaves us with logic errors and so on. if you expect an exception to be thrown because of a specific logic error, just omit the logic error
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:50:03] are you guys talking about memory state when segv occures? That wouldn't be a problem. The "host" program would wipe all the memory that unsafe code used
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:50:49] those .so "plugins" will be delt specific amount of memory for themselves and could modify "host" state only via host function, which from the perspective of the plugin are essntially atomic
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:50:50] pyzozord: if that program was e.g. a library call, then it had access to *your* memory, and it was using *your* stack
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:50:58] bjs: or if you're not protecting againt a specific logic error you're trying to protect against any arbitrary logic error that might happen, but you can't, because it might leave your program in some kind of wonky state
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:51:09] and *your* compiler was allowed to assume that the library call didn't SEGV, so maybe your program is now in an inconsistent state too
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:51:18] I can foresee many things going wrong with this ...
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:51:22] recovery may be possible but there is no hope for you of knowing how to recover because you don't know why you're handling an exception
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:51:24] bjs: yeah true, but those would be fairly simple plugins they woul not have any io of their own
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:51:32] pyzozord: plugins?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:52:25] I do get what you mean about memory state though, it's good to mention that, but I think in this case it woul be ok, since I would be writing those plugins myself
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:52:42] it's essentially there to not crash the host program because I made a typo etc
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:52:49] pyzozord: imagine the library went `printf(*NULL); int* x; *x = 42`  <- if you call this program from your program, you may find that part of *your* memory now has 42 in it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:53:08] pyzozord: if you cause heap corruption in a plugin it will be essentially impossible to recover
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:53:46] Oh i see, I do think I've caused some corruptions before
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:54:06] pyzozord: if the library does a bad thing, it could affect you if you're in the same process.  This is why modern systems do things in separate processes
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:54:39] yes sounds like separate process is much safer
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:54:51] so how does python handle situations like this?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:55:00] it doesn't
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:55:02] I guess it doesn't care about heap corruption because it's interpreted?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:55:13] pyzozord: not because it's interpreted, but because it's designed to just not let you do that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:55:18] you can cause python to have memory errors from pure python!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edgar-rft	[18:55:34] no, it doesn't care about heap corruption because it's Python :-)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:55:36] you can probably even get code execution out of some of them, but i haven't, not really my area
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:55:44] pyzozord: it puts explicit checks on things, and then does the C++ thing of generating runtime objects and walking the stack
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:56:32] Without any of the UB of C
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[18:57:23] I know, once you have a single UB your program might as well steal your bitcoins and crash
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:58:08] It's a very deliberate decision of Python to not have C-like UB and to instead have explicit checks and exceptions.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:58:22] from memory you can get a very straightforward buffer overflow out of types.CodeType
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:58:37] edk: or just from ctypes and then use C to do the bad thing
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:58:58] and there are some WONTFIX's in the interpreter like stackoverflows from unbounded recursion
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:58:58] yes, but that wouldn't be using pure python
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[18:59:12] edk: well define "pure Python", types.CodeType isn't "pure Python" either :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:59:21] sure it is, i can get it without importing anything
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[18:59:39] you could imagine a "sandboxed" python interpreter just not allowing you to use ctypes at all, but retaining the data model
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:00:41] so separate process is really the only way to be truly protected
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:00:46] edk: I mean the code objects don't have well-defined co_code attributes, they're just implementation defined black boxes really
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:00:50] and that applies for all languages
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:01:11] bjs: well obviously python-the-language doesn't have any implementation bugs, by definition
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:01:28] pyzozord: for security concerns too,  it means the library doesn't have access to your memory either which is good
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:01:36] pyzozord: and e.g. why your browser probably has separate processes for each tab
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:01:42] shame that this doesn't hold true for threads
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:01:53] i'm just saying the reference implementation does, and they've been known for years and never fixed, and you don't need any deliberate escape hatches to get to them
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:02:03] pyzozord: a thread (e.g. on unix) is really just a process that specifically has this bit turned off :)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:02:06] although wouldn't thread protect me against stack smashing/overflows/corruptions?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:02:08] otherwise they're the same
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:02:52] pyzozord: threads don't protect you very much against exploits because once an exploit gains control of one thread it can easily use that to do anything it likes to the other threads
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:02:54] bjs: the same as separate process or the same as the host process
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:03:14] threads are like separate processes except they share address space
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:03:22] pyzozord: no I mean if you're talking unix-y things then a "thread" and a "process" are the same thing underneath
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:03:33] pyzozord: the difference is 1 bit of the flags to clone()
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:04:15] so if I run the main program that spawns one extra thread. If that thread does heap corruption or segv, can I recover in my main program?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:04:23] pyzozord: no because it's in the same memory space
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:05:06] segv is the good case; you have an opportunity to exit as safely as you can and start a clean copy of yourself
2021-07-20 10:40:19	bjs	[19:05:16] anything in the same memory space is pretty much doomed because the "bad" program had access to all your memory and really could've done anything to it.  How likely it is to have done that highly depends on the program, what it was doing at the time, how badly it was broken, what compiler was used to compile it and what optimizations were enabled and what day of the week it was :P
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:05:23] but the thread can also screw you up with heap corruption or similar
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:06:59] ok, when my program crashes do I need to drop tcp connections?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:07:01] even if you did know there was something to recover it might not be possible; the information might simply have been destroyed
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:07:06] the OS will do that for you
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:07:15] is it possible that os will keep the connections alive until my program reboots?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:07:22] no
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:07:47] it may leave the sockets around depending on the socket options and the OS and the OS settings and what the other end does, but it won't give them to the next copy of your program
2021-07-20 10:40:19	edk	[19:08:01] really keeping connections open when you crash is much more work than closing them
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pyzozord	[19:16:21] ok, thank you everyone who participated in the discussion to help me. I've learned new things.
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:36:06] and here's an improved version of my ADPCM encoder
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:36:10] https://bpa.st/KP2HIELDM7GDSPLVEAS4G5RAJ4
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:36:29] including a decoder that doesn't generate an easily-playable file
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:36:29] https://bpa.st/SJR2LQLA4ZP4Q535C234TR7JIA
2021-07-20 10:40:19	eyynet4	[19:37:49] thats the really low bitrate one that only encodes delta values so uses way less bits?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[19:38:03] nice i like delta encoding
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:38:24] eyynet4: i don't really understand your question
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:38:29] beaky: thanks
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:39:19] all of the code you're seeing here is based on DVI IMA ADPCM spec that's floating around the internet for years
2021-07-20 10:40:19	eyynet4	[19:40:05] delta == difference
2021-07-20 10:40:19	eyynet4	[19:40:08] change
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:42:58] i changed "delta" to "difference" before in the encoder code
2021-07-20 10:40:19	ITD4004	[19:43:18] it generated files that the decoder file put out as terribad to listen to
2021-07-20 10:40:19	eyynet4	[19:43:49] nice, i need to implement the mu-law format still myself.  i was banking on signed 16bit LE being ubiquitous
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pulse	[19:58:06] is Consolas the best programming font in existence?
2021-07-20 10:40:19	eyynet4	[19:58:14] nayyyy
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pulse	[19:59:06] open source pro is too wide
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pulse	[19:59:11] inconsolata is too narrow
2021-07-20 10:40:19	quippy	[20:03:19] sounds like personal preference to me
2021-07-20 10:40:19	quippy	[20:03:27] Goldilocks
2021-07-20 10:40:19	eyynet4	[20:08:28] http://rasher.dk/rockbox/fonts/jmk/
2021-07-20 10:40:19	 *	piou [20:08:31] likes terminus
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pulse	[20:08:41] eyynet4, ah, a font for ants
2021-07-20 10:40:19	 *	pulse [20:08:48] picks up the magnifying glass
2021-07-20 10:40:19	TheRedRipper	[20:17:57] font for wat
2021-07-20 10:40:19	eyynet4	[20:18:08] ANTS!
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:19:21] yes the best font is bitmapped fonts like the default xterm font because it is bitmapped so it is always crisp
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:19:34] whereas consolas always looks blurry with bad antialiasing and color fringing
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:19:40] (or any other modren font)
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pulse	[20:19:53] i would agree with that
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pulse	[20:19:57] if the default resolution was still 640x480
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:20:20] even in my 2160p monitor i use nice crisp sick bitmapped fonts
2021-07-20 10:40:19	pulse	[20:20:37] do you use a telescope
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:20:58] no i just like the tiny crisp text i can have everything side-by-side
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:23:53] though my favorite non bitmapped font is iosevka because of how condensed it is (so i can fit so much side-by-side) https://typeof.net/Iosevka/
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:24:41] and also extremely customizable so if you like it but for instance hate the ligatures or prefer the zeroes or m's to look differently like another font then you can tweak it
2021-07-20 10:40:19	TheRedRipper	[20:25:10] beaky: i like Motter Tektura
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:25:55] nice i have to check that out
2021-07-20 10:40:19	beaky	[20:28:00] the numbers look too
2021-07-20 10:40:19	micrex22	[20:30:35] pulse: I too only run bitmapped / hinted fonts as well
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:30:46] I cannot stand anti-aliasing (which actually is aliasing) on fonts
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:30:57] ESPECIALLY not Microsoft's cleartype *puke*
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[20:31:26] yes aliasing is the worst
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:32:18] pulse: if you've never seen what a 1080p anti-alias free setup looks like, here you go: https://i.imgur.com/dc0U4os.png
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:33:20] I would argue that bitmapped and fonts with special hinting data are actually easier to see at a distance
2021-07-20 10:40:20	pulse	[20:35:04] uh, i much prefer the aliased look
2021-07-20 10:40:20	pulse	[20:35:13] antialiased*
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:35:21] A properly made font will have bitmap strikes (a series of bitmaps for each size generally up until 16 pt) and other fonts somehow have special hinting data or something to fall back on that retain sharpness
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:35:48] *shrug* some people do, or don't even notice it as they have cotton buds in their eyes--but I've always just hated fonts that are smoothed over
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:36:47] https://i.imgur.com/6bGGrjT.png mmmm I love the fonts on AIX
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:37:19] If only all UNIX environments had that out of box
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[20:40:29] see it is nice and crisp
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheRedRipper	[20:40:34] wa
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[20:41:22] the only reason i dont use bitmap fonts is because they dont display all the unicode i use like emoji
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:43:25] beaky: well the font I'm using on linux isn't technically a bitmap font, but it has extra data that makes it sharp at certain sizes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:43:29] (and it does have emojis)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[20:43:48] yes i thinkt aht is the best of both worlds
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[20:44:35] i havent gone full 'disable all anti aliasing' because then all of the web will look very ugly
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:44:52] beaky: that's why you use firefox so you can enforce one font
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:45:03] beaky: also when you say emoji support, I immediately thought of this https://i.redd.it/cozohvgr2h7z.png
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[20:45:04] but i like having websites choose their own font i like diversity
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[20:45:12] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:45:16] I hate the awful fonts websites use
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:45:29] The font designers today need to be taken outside and put down
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:45:49] (If I could force the world to use Helvetica as the sole font, I would :3 )
2021-07-20 10:40:20	micrex22	[20:46:12] Some of the open source google fonts are just about the ugliest things I've ever seen
2021-07-20 10:40:20	AbleBacon	[20:55:56] is there a C# / .NET channel?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[20:57:01] why tho, i mean there probably is one
2021-07-20 10:40:20	AbleBacon	[20:58:32] what do you mean why? i have a C# / .NET question :(
2021-07-20 10:40:20	AbleBacon	[20:58:50] i'm trying to pass a C++/CLI "array<System::Byte>^" to a C# program as a "byte[]", but it comes out as length 1, even though i'm ensuring that the "array<System::Byte>^" is longer than that--and that one byte is always the correct first byte of the array... what's going on here, or is there a better channel to ask about this?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	AbleBacon	[20:58:56] ^^^ if you guys happen to know the answer :-/
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[21:01:35] wow they let oyou pass arrays from c++ to C# seamlessly somehow?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[21:02:03] it's c++/cli like a microsoftified c++
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[21:03:07] like an extension to their generic implementation?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[21:07:49] one that runs under the clr
2021-07-20 10:40:20	AbleBacon	[21:11:42] it's NOT seamless at all and is kind of a nightmare
2021-07-20 10:40:20	AbleBacon	[21:12:41] i have my C code that runs 'gstreamer' and it NEEDS to be unadulterated, so i have a visual studio project for that. then i have a project with C++/CLI wrappers for the C stuff and it has all the microsoft language addons. then i have ANOTHER project that defines an interface between the C++ and C# stuff. then yet ANOTHER project with the actual C# code
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[21:24:02] can't you just give it a memory address and use a mutex or whatever ms calls it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[21:28:37] or is c# one of those languages that don't believe in memory addresses
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheLinuxNerd	[21:30:16] eyynet4 IntPtr :-)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheLinuxNerd	[21:31:40] eyynet4 what I'd do, is use the C++ project to create a PInvoke compatible DLL for the gstreamer
2021-07-20 10:40:20	TheLinuxNerd	[21:31:46] a wrapper
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[21:34:29] what i'd do is just never use c# because now you are in the business of platform specifics
2021-07-20 10:40:20	AbleBacon	[21:35:51] i hadn't tried using an IntPtr... not sure C# will let me convert that to an array
2021-07-20 10:40:20	AbleBacon	[21:36:41] System::String^ works fine, so i don't know why it hates byte arrays
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest2379	[21:51:24] In C++, how do I read each line of a plain text file and add up all the numbers without using an array?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Thedarkb-Desktop	[21:55:43] Add each line you read in to a running total?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	Thedarkb-Desktop	[21:55:51] Assuming each number is on its own line.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[21:59:03] you can do it without an arry using streams and iterators https://ideone.com/YWohcJ
2021-07-20 10:40:20	InPhase	[22:04:51] guest2379: loop, std::getline, parse, iterative tally.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:11:39] why would you do that though
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[22:12:21] useful if you want to process an infinite stream of numbers
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[22:13:44] (but even with streams it can be efficient to buffer and process with simd
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:15:10] it's going to be a pain trying to convert string to "number" without using an array
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:15:15] really not worth it IMO
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:16:49] unless you store the index and rewind
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:17:13] number_start_idx
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:19:11] thats probably going to be a 64bit file offset, so 8 characters worth of "not-an-array"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:19:27] then llseek systemcall overhead on e.g. linux
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:32:28] If you have n input numbers up to m bits each, you can add them up with only O(m log n) space instead of O(nm).
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:33:07] I think that's what's really behind restrictions like "without using an array"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	pikapika	[22:37:42] PlanckWalk, by just considering two terms at a time?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	pikapika	[22:37:50] ie s+=n[i]
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:38:07] I'm assuming the input is a stream, but basically yes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	pikapika	[22:38:49] and therefore the O() of memory involved is decided by the maximum size of the result
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:38:56] Though the "+=" hides a lot of arbitrary-size-integer complexity
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:39:21] max size could be infinite though !
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:40:28] Also I'm assuming the input stream is some form of symbol sequence, not "native" integers.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:41:13] yeah its "plain text"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:41:33] basically its a nonsensical question without knowing these parameters of interest
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:41:47] Indeed.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[22:42:11] is it an x y probem
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:42:28] It's probably something like "the input is at most 2 billion natural numbers, each less than 2 billion.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:42:35] (Implied or explicitly stated)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[22:43:33] imagine the calamity if they were signed integers but they didn't mention if two's compliment or some other encoding of negative numbers
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[22:44:03] If the input stream is characters, I'd expect the usual prefixed "-"
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[22:54:42] besides linear types (rust) and gradual typing (typescript) what are some other recent ideas from programming language theory that are gaining popularity i always feel that programming language theory is like the least successful cs subdiscipline because bret victor says that plt researchers only think about either teaching lagnuages, type theory (which only programming language theorists
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[22:54:44] care about), and compiler implementation
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[22:56:04] or things like lean which are not what bret victor would call 'languages for scientists' but which might interest mathematicians but mathematicians arent interested in the plt bits in themselves but in getting their work 'formalized'
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[23:17:34] except for julia
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[23:22:11] julia is the next big thing in scientific computing
2021-07-20 10:40:20	pavonia	[23:54:07] Feminists would slap you in the face for this statement
2021-07-20 10:40:20	CuriousErnestBro	[00:06:54] how dare you call julia a "
2021-07-20 10:40:20	CuriousErnestBro	[00:06:59] "big thing"?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[00:13:05] it lets you progam efficient numerical computing codes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[00:13:14] but in a much more expressive way with more modern notation and stuff
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[00:15:43] imagine python but with the speed of fortran and the expressiveness of lisp
2021-07-20 10:40:20	CuriousErnestBro	[00:33:27] but doesn't R do the same beaky?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[00:33:43] yes but julia is much more better and modern
2021-07-20 10:40:20	CuriousErnestBro	[00:33:46] vectorization
2021-07-20 10:40:20	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:13] I wanted to go through this for a long time: https://julia.quantecon.org/
2021-07-20 10:40:20	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:17] do you know it beaky?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:31] I now use python or R for all my quant (finance) needs
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[00:34:49] nope i dont know economics

2021-07-20 10:40:20	CuriousErnestBro	[00:36:48] beaky me neither but it looks a well put together book

2021-07-20 10:40:20	JaneyDoe	[00:43:03] the problem with R is
2021-07-20 10:40:20	JaneyDoe	[00:43:13] the programmers just dont 'get it'
2021-07-20 10:40:20	JaneyDoe	[00:43:25] im not sure what it is, but R doesnt have it

2021-07-20 10:40:20	JaneyDoe	[00:46:22] wheres the multiprocessing libraries, package manager, version control, functional programming influence (beyond the superficial), consinstency or standards?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	JaneyDoe	[00:46:34] and whats with the memory limits and stuff? idk bro
2021-07-20 10:40:20	JaneyDoe	[00:46:44] guess I just dont get R

2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[01:42:58] hello soulisson im beaky
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[01:45:37] could someone please take a look at this and give me a hint at what im doing wrong? https://bpa.st/MMYA
2021-07-20 10:40:20	WarauSalesman	[01:47:48] guest3290: you need a C++ book
2021-07-20 10:40:20	WarauSalesman	[01:47:54] you are doing lots of wrong things
2021-07-20 10:40:20	soulisson	[01:48:19] how are you beaky?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[01:48:28] do you have a book you would recommend?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	WarauSalesman	[01:48:32] guest3290: actually, you don't even know how to code. how did you come up with that thing?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	WarauSalesman	[01:48:52] guest3290: you can join ##C++ or ##C++-general for more advice. then you can type !books in one of these channels
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[01:49:48] okay. thank you.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[01:49:52] I know I'm really bad.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[01:52:03] you dont have to list everything, but can you please tell me a few things im doing that are wrong.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	WarauSalesman	[01:53:08] declaration and definition of functions should have the same/similar signature
2021-07-20 10:40:20	WarauSalesman	[01:56:17] guest3290: you seem to be throwing random stuff and expecting it to compile for some reason
2021-07-20 10:40:20	JaneyDoe	[02:00:54] guest3290: switch to irssi irc client too for time being (it'll help you get more familiar with command-line and become a better programmer)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	JaneyDoe	[02:01:06] at least for 6 months
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:01:18] JaneyDoe: That's an opinion.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[02:01:58] i use weechat sometimes but on this computer i use hexchat
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:02:23] I second the recommendation to get a good book.  Hexchat is a perfectly fine, and popular, IRC client.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:13:06] It's almost a bit curious, but C++'s language ecosystem really does need books.  You can get away without a good book in several other language ecosystems.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[02:13:40] https://bpa.st/AWOA
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[02:14:25] WarauSalesman: i got it working in just main without any functions or class. im going to get a C++ book and read up on functions and classes.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[02:14:52] what C++ book do you guys recommend?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	eyynet4	[02:16:07] c++ would be like a 10 part megaseries on DVD
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:20:27] guest3290: The #c++ nolyc bot recommends this list: http://stackoverflow.com/q/388242/1090079
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:22:12] guest3290: Personal recommendation is to see what your local and university libraries have as far as that list is concerned.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	guest3290	[02:22:30] thank you
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:23:55] guest3290: Especially in the "beginner" level (which really aren't that beginner, really, imho).  My personal favorite is always "The Design and Evolution of C++", it's completely out of date and not relevant for modern C++, but it gives enormous insight into understanding how and why C++ is the way it is.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:24:37] (Don't use it to learn C++!  Just to get an appreciation of the history)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:48:43] Am I ascertaiing this correctly?.. In a linked list - I can not use size (size of list) in any logic to navigate the list because two numbers both represent the same position? Namely size 0, while it may mean the list is empty, represents the head of the list; and, size 1, while it may represent there being one node in the list, also represents the head of the list.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:48:57] Am I understanding that right?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:49:05] blahboybaz: How are you calculating size?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:49:32] arahael: when a node is created, size++, when a node is deleted, size--
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:49:48] size = 0; at initialization
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:50:46] blahboybaz: And where is 'size' stored?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[02:50:51] It depends on how your design your linked list. Does the linked list have a 'meta object' that represents the list as a whole, or is it just a bunch of nodes with pointers to other nodes.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[02:50:54] ?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:51:11] vdamewood: Howdy!
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[02:51:20] arahael: G'day.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:51:26] arahael: It is a field in the class definition (outside the constructor but still in the class definition)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:51:36] private field
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:51:41] blahboybaz: Class definition of what?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[02:51:44] blahboybaz: It might help if you specify which language you're working with.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:52:05] vdamewood: javascript
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[02:52:19] Ah, yes. JavaScript 'classes'.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:52:49] There are 2 classes a Node class. And a List class. The list class (composes) the node class. I don't think it composes it exactly but it uses it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:52:55] no inheritance
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[02:54:09] So, then the List class would have the size value, and it should be zero if there are no nodes yet.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[02:54:19] Then once there is a node, then size would be 1.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:54:31] Fwiw, this is what I've been working with, testing, tweaking..  https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5snkxhf   <--   its a bit of a mess at the end with lines for some manual testing
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:55:28] vdamewood: yes but the only diff between and empty list and a list with one node in it is   this.head = new Node();
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:55:44] blahboybaz: I thought you said that you also do size++?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[02:55:57] (So that's another difference)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:56:56] arahael: I thought I did. There's 2 ways to make a list tho too. Can specify a size in the constructor and blast out a list at initialzation of the object or can create an object with empty list then add / remove nodes later
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[02:58:21] Oh, I guess if you initialize the object iwth a list I just set the size with whatever is passed into the constructor but doo size++ or size-- if you create/delete nodes after initialization
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[02:58:24] blahboybaz: Huh?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:00:20] It's a nightmare. My code is blowing up, ok, there, I admitted it. And I don't know why
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:00:53] blahboybaz: I don't get what you mean by the only difference is... what you said.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:01:21] I've spend the last 2 days (off and on) trying to figure it out and I don't see why it's acting the way it does. I wonder if I have some synchronicity problem but I'm so new to js I wouldn't know enough to see it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:01:31] I mean, yeah, ane empty list is going to have zero nodes, and a list with one node is going to have one node. That's expected.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:01:46] s/ane/an/
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[03:02:34] blahboybaz: Develop a short test case that explains the problem you have.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[03:02:51] blahboybaz: 'when you do this... You expect THIS, but you get THAT'.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:03:38] blahboybaz: You can probably streamline your constructor a little.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:03:47] vdamewood: When the list is empty and you create the first node all you do is  this.head = new Node();  (pretty much). So the size increases from 0 to 1 and  this.head just goes from null to containing a Node object.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:04:29] blahboybaz: Um. Yeah. So what's the problem?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:04:38] arahael: I can do that (develop a test case)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[03:04:53] blahboybaz: just to clarify, 'this.head = new Node()' is adding the first item onto the list?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:05:04] arahael: yes
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[03:05:18] So it now has 1 item in it...
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:07:35] https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5snkxhf  <--  It looks like the output that the list is empty is getting executed no matter what and the actual list item is not being output at all - may indicate a deeper issue
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:07:41] vdamewood:  ^
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:09:26] blahboybaz: On line 115, why do you check index == 0?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:09:29] arahael: Well I've done various tests. Iirc when I cerate a list at initialzation of the object things seem to work fine (I would have to verify that). But if I try to work with nodes later (initialize with an empty list then add / remove nodes later) then stuff goes haywire
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:11:23] When I wrote the code I thought that index = 0 means you are at the head of the lst (empty or not is a separate issue). So I check to see if you are at the head of the list && if there is a node there or not
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:11:33] Same with line 102.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[03:12:21] blahboybaz: What do you mean by "work with nodes later" - you mean, bypass your List class?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:12:23] But index is user input, you shouldn't asume it has anything to do with the structure of your class.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:12:42] yes 115 and 102 that was my logic to check position and whether the list was empty or not but now I'm not so sure that's right. Just maybe not right for a deeper reason than what it might seem
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:13:04] Also, if you check for index == 0, and node is instanceof Node, then you ignore the case where index !=0, but node is still not an instance of Node.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:13:38] So, if you try to do something to index 4 of a 4-element list, you've just tried to set null's data, which it doesn't have.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[03:13:39] Too many sources of truth. :(
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:13:39] arahael: There are 2 ways to create a list. You can either create a list when you initialize the list object or you can initialize the list object with no list items and add / remove them later (after initialization)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:15:25] Also, since your calling console.log insize printNode, you don't have to wrap your call to it in a console.log call.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:15:29] *you're
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:15:51] vdamewood: I have a validate() function for checking the index value against the list bounds but it is not seen in that paste (I have it locally in a separate file). As the one giving the input I'm being careful not to exceed the list bounds anywhere
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:16:23] I have to take time to read what is being said to me - I'm getting behind
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:16:26] blahboybaz: Well, I can only comment on the code I see. Still, it's terrible logic.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:17:35] vdamewood: I'm sure it is
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:18:13] Well, when you get that test case done, maybe I can help figure out what's going wrong.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:18:28] For now, there's just way too much going on.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:18:29] I"ll work on it
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:19:09] Have I ever mentioned how much I think the Contents directory in a .app is stupid?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:19:32] As in, why not just have the MacOS, Frameworks, and Resources directories right in the .app?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:20:02] And, you know, whatever else might be in there.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:22:03] Also, why is it the 'MacOS' directory, and not the 'Executable' directory or something like that?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:22:10] Okay. I think I'm done.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:25:32] Dear cat, no I will not cuddle with you right now.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:25:44] I'm busy cuddling with my computer.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	arahael	[03:37:49] Computers do not make great cuddle partners.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	dodo	[03:41:11] not with that attitude
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[03:41:43] so system f has undecidable type inference, so why dont lagnuages that use system f like haskell go all the way and just use dependent types which are also undecidable
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[03:44:52] beaky: Using the same principles as "everyone dies, so let's just kill everyone"? ;-)
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[03:45:28] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[03:46:04] yes system f is good for polymorphism, but it is not obvious what dependent types are good for
2021-07-20 10:40:20	PlanckWalk	[03:48:05] On a related note, I wonder whether the set of Turing machines that provably halt is Turing-complete.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:49:07] Does the set of all sets include my TV set?
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[03:58:09] I'm gonna work on this some more before I ask for help again. I think I see some things going on now (making test cases helpted). Thanks for talking with me about it. That helped a lot
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[03:59:36] blahboybaz: I have a suggestion.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[03:59:42] yes i think it is not turing complete because if they were turing complete then you'd have proofs that the turing machine halts for some problems but this would be impossible under rice's theorem i think so ex falso quolibet
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[04:01:50] blahboybaz: On line 25, you start an if/else block. Since the check for count == 0) will be true once, and only once, the first time it goes through, run this code before the while loop, and start count as 1.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[04:02:20] Then you can remove the if/else entirely and just add the additional nodes.
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[04:02:42] no wait its nto because of the proofs that it is impsosbiel but because they are provably halting
2021-07-20 10:40:20	blahboybaz	[04:03:16] vdamewood: Let me examine that. Thanks
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[04:03:39] i just like the name rice's theorem i think of the food

2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[04:08:55] to formalize this i need dependent types
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[04:10:13] the set of all provably-halting turing machines has a type that need some tea to figure out how to express, and to be able to say they are provably halting i need pi types a kind of dependent type
2021-07-20 10:40:20	beaky	[04:11:14] then i must formalize rice's theorem
2021-07-20 10:40:20	vdamewood	[04:15:05] Chicken and rice sounds nice.

2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[17:49:00] and with their super slow startup and build times
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:49:16] maybe it's time for clojure on graal?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[17:49:23] makes even the most template metaprogrammed c++ compile like a speed demon by comparison
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:49:30] haha xD
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[17:50:47] I need to do more both depth and breadth learning
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:51:00] how do you do that?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[17:51:25] i wouldn't know - that's why I need to do more of it :P
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[17:51:54] i prefer dfs
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[17:52:21] dfs first search :)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[17:53:35] like study data structures and compilers indepth but also like learn a new language briefly once avery few weeks
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:53:46] oh
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:54:01] that's usually done in a pl book
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[17:54:12] i tried reading about alogirthms
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[17:54:31] they kinda don't make any sense to me at first, but after a while you learn
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:54:32] the one's from the 80s and 90s would discuss 4-5 languages
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:54:48] not sure if that's the focus from the newer ones
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[17:54:59] stuff like mergesort is pretty intuitive to me nowdays
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:55:29] as for data structures, there is the compiler approach like wirth, or just have it be completely seperate
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:55:50] I would like to do more data strcutures as well, but to be honest you only need a few
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[17:56:10] i'd still look it up though, just in case. sometimes i wonder if a sort function hides multiple functions inside and chooses one depending on the amount of data to sort
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[17:57:11] for me dijkstra is intuitive, dont really understand why people are intimidated by it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:57:35] the algorithm?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[17:57:40] fwiw a lot of my experience is just hands on stuf
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[17:57:49] the biggest part of it is the piority queue, and that's done with the binary heap, and i dont remember those thing it does with bubble up and sink down or whatever
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[17:57:55] but otherwise it quite simple
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[17:58:08] i am very likely to fail a lot of actual implementations, but speaking about them theoretically makes sense to me nowdays
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[17:59:24] interestingly enough how you implement data structures is kinda limited by more abstract languages
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:00:04] abstractions are.. dunno how to say it, make hard things easy but easy things hard?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[18:00:31] can you do data strucutres in assembly?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:00:47] you're right, i used the wrong idiom
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[18:01:00] user51: they make poking about the computer more difficult
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:01:02] assembly is kinda interesting sometimes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:01:34] in a sense that you have little programs connected to the larger one
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:02:35] in essense you could argue that many languages apply but the structure of asm makes it much easier to see
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:03:07] damn, i just made a shift-reduce conflict in the last two messages
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:04:51] are C++ coroutines "alright", or are there any signifiicant gotchas, let's say performance-wise?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	TheRedRipper	[18:05:26] µµ
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[18:06:13] koo6: why would there be?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:06:50] maybethe implementations (gcc, llvm) could still be immature? idk
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:07:08] just figured i'd fish around before diving into them
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Izem	[18:07:49] that's just weird tbh
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:08:46] oh well
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:10:55] Oh that reminds me. I started the subject yesterday, but I have more questions. Is it possible to write C code that that if crashes instead of stopping the program it just jumps to some other instruction? I know that programs: segment fault, stack overflow, divide by 0. I guess there are other reasons why program crash. But if I'm not mistaken they are all just handled as os signals. So it seems
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:11:01] reasonable that I had my own handlers for those signals that do not stop execution. Essentially a try/catach
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:12:02] I wanted that so that I can safely run .so code without crashing my main program
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:12:31] pyzozord: it depends on what "crash" means
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:12:52] i wouldn't call that safe
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:12:55] pyzozord: most "crashes" are caused because you did some bad thing in C that was unrecoverable (like accessing memory you were not allowed) and it's the OS that killed you, not the C program choosing to quit
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:13:26] https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_signal_handling.htm
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Guest2949	[18:13:26] pyzozordI think you may be able to use setjmp and longjmp to handle that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:13:48] Guest2949: yeah I was thinking about longjmp too
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:14:19] bjs: is it that os kills you or os sends you signal "hey, chill" and kills you if you don't?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[18:14:48] straight up killin ur process
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:15:06] pyzozord: it depends.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:15:28] pyzozord: some things are signals you can handle and jump out of (although, exactly what state the machine is in at that point is unclear, especially for a C program)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:15:59] some things are straight-up killed without the OS even asking first (e.g. OOM is typically this)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Guest2949	[18:16:06] Hmmm
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:16:15] bjs: what else kills you?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Guest2949	[18:16:17] That's a good point.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Guest2949	[18:16:23] LOL pyzozord
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:16:54] pyzozord: well the OS can send signals like SIGSEGV and SIGILL when the process does a "bad" thing
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[18:17:17] yes i like sigbus too i imagine a bus coming a stopping by
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:17:19] bjs: so I can't not die when I get segv?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:18:40] pyzozord: you can keep the process alive (sometimes) but like I said, and especially when it's a C program, the state of the machine is often very unclear
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[18:18:46] you can handle it and not die i think but sigkill in particular is where u get striaght'up killed (its what the out of memory killer thing does)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[18:19:19] or if you use kill -9 the only kill command everyone uses
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[18:19:24] because nobody uses sigstop
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:19:44] that's fine when they want me dead I should die
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[18:19:46] or sigterm to ask the process nicely to stop (thats the one you can handle)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:19:51] I just don't wanna die because of internal problems
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:19:55] pyzozord: imagine you `*x = 1; read(*y)`  now if you get a SIGSEGV on reading y, you might think that the write of x already happened but that's not probably not true. and infact the entire state could just be a total mess
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:20:13] probably not true*
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:20:46] bjs: yeah I get that part I think that's not a problem
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[18:20:51] yes with signals it might not be possible to decide causality that u might be looking for
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:22:20] i would want to do something like setjmp(); if (do_unsafe_so_stuff()) { /*jump here if so crashed us*/ handle_error } all_cool_here_carry_on()
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:22:59] im probably using setjmp wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:24:28] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10202941/segmentation-fault-handling
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:24:53] pyzozord: the most robust way is usually to do the unsafe library stuff in a separate process, maybe mmap some space so it can give you back data
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:25:02] it really seems to be retying the instruction .. interesting
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:25:06] and if it goes wrong then you can just discard the space and drop the process and
2021-07-20 10:40:41	koo6	[18:25:14] ^
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:25:18] oh hmm nice idea
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:25:24] c syntax can be fun tho
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:25:26] just unsafe process
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:25:51] *(pointer = &var) = something(&pointer)[0];
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:25:58] unsafe so server process
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:26:22] could do parallelism that way too
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:28:02] user51: Pretty sure that's UB.  :)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:28:16] InPhase: really? didn't know
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:28:33] user51: Assignment is not a sequence point, so the order is not specified for left and right there.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:29:15] how does c++ implement the try/catch stuff
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:29:17] user51: It's left undefined for optimization purposes, but that slams it into UB if you modify something used on the other side.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:29:29] will it even catch segfaults and divisions by zero?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:29:37] undefined foreign optimization
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:30:37] InPhase: my thought process was that the rightmost side gets evaluated first, then the resulting value is assigned
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:30:38] pyzozord: it does checks before you do certain operations, and if you do a bad thing it walks up the stack to find a try/catch and it stores a bit of information on the stack that lets it walk back up
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:30:39] pyzozord: Officially in C++, no.  But you can setup signal handlers on an implementation-specific basis that convert those signals into exception throws.  I've done this for segfault logging.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:32:04] pyzozord: It's pretty nice to get a stack trace report out of release builds of C++ for a segfault.  It just requires platform-specific code.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	user51	[18:32:33] i wonder if enron would have liked undefined behavior
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:33:05] pyzozord: it's basically entirely a software thing,  the software does checks, creates an exception object and then walks the stack to find a catch that matches it and if it does, it pops off and jumps there to continue. No OS signals or anything involved
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:34:00] bjs: I see so those are just runtime checks injected by c++
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:34:13] InPhase: ok so that sounds almost perfect
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:34:23] (except I prefer c instead of c++)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:35:01] pyzozord: Yes.  Standard exceptions are basically just code insertion like bjs said.  What it's about is cleaning up the code so that code is focused on the positive-path and is much cleaner.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:35:23] ok so sounds like that idea of set a jump, do unsafe code, if it triggers a segv, handle the segv, in the segv do the longjmp
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:35:26] will work, right?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:35:32] pyzozord: Also there's the important benefit that exceptions guarantee errors are handled somewhere.  Errors do not get ignored.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:35:37] pyzozord: saying it will "work" might be going far
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:35:41] it won't immediately kill the process
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:35:46] pyzozord: Many many many C bugs are due to missed or skipped error checking.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:35:59] in very many cases you're likely to just get another SIGV immediately after
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:36:44] pyzozord: In any large C++ program intended to be robust, you assume exceptions will happen, and you put catch-all handlers at opportune recovery points to deal with this in a useful manner.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:37:20] pyzozord: Then for the ones you can handle locally with a better recovery, you add an additional catch.  But your catch-alls handle everything else, and you end up dealing with every error in some useful way.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:37:39] not convinced programs with catch-all handlers can claim to be robust, tbh
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:37:50] edk: More robust than the ones without this!
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:37:57] that's debatable
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:38:09] if the exception isn't caught you'll at least know they went wrong
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:38:32] edk: Here's a simple program structure:  You push buttons to do stuff.  A catch-all should report, "That button press didn't work because:  ____"  Then return to where you can try another button press.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:38:39] InPhase: to provide context, that still the continuation of the idea from yesterday. I imagine a MUD game where I can create a new "script.so" and then assign it to some object in the running game. The game will then load the script.so, and execute it depending on the game logic. Whever the game executes something from the so I want to have that safety even if the script.so segvs, it doesn't take
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:38:45] down the entire game with it, the game just handles it somehow, forexample unloading the .so and logging the error somewhere
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:39:06] InPhase: right, but for all you know the button press did half of something
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:39:42] maybe it's rotated an x-ray target out of the way but not switched off a power circuit
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:39:44] edk: If you used scope-based resource management with a structure that planned ahead for exceptions, that will all be handled automatically at the stack unwinding.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:40:02] resource management will be. you can't manage state that way
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:40:10] edk: Scope-based resource management should be comprehensive throughout the program design.  Exception handling is central to architecture, and not an afterthought.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:40:28] edk: a C program probably literally cannot claim such a thing
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:40:36] a Python program probably could be robust in such errors :)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:40:53] i claim python is equivalent in robustness to C
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:41:06] edk: If you're used to C programming, then this sort of recovery during unwinding is unthinkable.  But designing FOR it in C++ makes it straightforward.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:41:16] edk: C's UB means you cannot recover at all though
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:41:20] all I'm really hoping for to get the kind of robustness python has in C
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:41:26] whereas in Python you theoretically could, depending on the circumstances
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:42:09] if something goes horribly wrong then so be it, but I think I never really experienced anything else then stack overflows and segmentation faults my entire life
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:42:16] once you've triggered UB you're screwed but i'm not convinced you can meaningfully recover from logic errors anyway, all python (or rust)-style safety gives you is more guarantees about the consequences of those errors
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:42:23] bjs: Python is a little trickier to recover from errors with catch-alls because you don't get deterministic destruction.  So you have to be more careful with state recovery, and include more catches.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:42:26] it can't protect the state of your program
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:42:46] 'course, rust also gives you better tools to avoid those errors than either of the other two
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:42:48] InPhase: well it's the other way around surely, if you have a C program with UB you *cannot* recover
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:42:53] there is literally no way in C to get out of UB
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:43:00] Exceptions are not for handling UB.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:43:08] InPhase: i feel like you're in write-only mode
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:43:23] InPhase: okay but handling UB is basically what pyzozord is trying to do
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:43:23] Exceptions CAN handle logic errors, data quality errors, and hardware errors just fine though.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:43:52] everything you've said is about resource management, which is fine, but doesn't encapsulate everything programs need to be consistent about
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:44:25] And I volunteered that I've mapped segfaults to exceptions before.  But I only do that for logging and reporting purposes.  I treat segfault exceptions as fatal errors when I do this, because you really can't trust program state after you've allowed UB to occur.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:44:30] if i'm halfway through changing the state of a system and i throw an exception, there's no amount of raii that can help
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:45:04] edk: I mean it depends on the system :P
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:45:16] imagine you screw up an IRC server, you can just delete the database for example :D
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:45:39] well in general, that system needs to be reset to a consistent state, and in order to know to reset the system in question you needed to expect me to throw an exception while mutating it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:45:48] a catchall higher up won't do
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:46:01] You can do a best-effort unwind, but it's unwise to continue even if you've caught and handled a segfault.  Probably 9 times out of 10 you really could recover in practice, but I wouldn't trust it.  I might attempt differently if lives were on the line for a program crash.  But it's not something you can rely on.  Regular exceptions can be implemented in a completely reliable manner with full trust
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[18:46:07] in the unwind and recovery.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:47:07] edk: sure but the difference between Python and C is that Python lets you see that something went wrong and attempt to do something about it. You may not be able in all cases to get back to where you were exactly, but Python at least will allow you to try. My database example is a bit tongue-in-cheek but certainly is an example
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:48:06] and there are various ways of doing checkpointing so that you can "recover" back to a previous consistent state. The point I'm making is that a single C program just cannot do that if there's UB, at least not in a way that also isn't just UB itself ;)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:48:18] bjs: right, but catching specific errors in python is, from some angles, equivalent to "don't make mistakes" in C, which is to say inadequate
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:49:39] edk: no it's not the same,  in C the compiler is allowed to just assume SIGSEGV never happens, it could detect your SIGSEGV handler and NOP it out, it could delete 1/2 your program.  The Python program would at least guarantee you hit an exception handler and be in a consistent state (that is, a consistent *interpreter* state) from which you can actually execute new code reliably
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:49:46] exceptions because of exceptional conditions are something else; they're doing what you do with return values in C. which leaves us with logic errors and so on. if you expect an exception to be thrown because of a specific logic error, just omit the logic error
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:50:03] are you guys talking about memory state when segv occures? That wouldn't be a problem. The "host" program would wipe all the memory that unsafe code used
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:50:49] those .so "plugins" will be delt specific amount of memory for themselves and could modify "host" state only via host function, which from the perspective of the plugin are essntially atomic
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:50:50] pyzozord: if that program was e.g. a library call, then it had access to *your* memory, and it was using *your* stack
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:50:58] bjs: or if you're not protecting againt a specific logic error you're trying to protect against any arbitrary logic error that might happen, but you can't, because it might leave your program in some kind of wonky state
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:51:09] and *your* compiler was allowed to assume that the library call didn't SEGV, so maybe your program is now in an inconsistent state too
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:51:18] I can foresee many things going wrong with this ...
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:51:22] recovery may be possible but there is no hope for you of knowing how to recover because you don't know why you're handling an exception
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:51:24] bjs: yeah true, but those would be fairly simple plugins they woul not have any io of their own
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:51:32] pyzozord: plugins?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:52:25] I do get what you mean about memory state though, it's good to mention that, but I think in this case it woul be ok, since I would be writing those plugins myself
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:52:42] it's essentially there to not crash the host program because I made a typo etc
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:52:49] pyzozord: imagine the library went `printf(*NULL); int* x; *x = 42`  <- if you call this program from your program, you may find that part of *your* memory now has 42 in it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:53:08] pyzozord: if you cause heap corruption in a plugin it will be essentially impossible to recover
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:53:46] Oh i see, I do think I've caused some corruptions before
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:54:06] pyzozord: if the library does a bad thing, it could affect you if you're in the same process.  This is why modern systems do things in separate processes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:54:39] yes sounds like separate process is much safer
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:54:51] so how does python handle situations like this?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:55:00] it doesn't
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:55:02] I guess it doesn't care about heap corruption because it's interpreted?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:55:13] pyzozord: not because it's interpreted, but because it's designed to just not let you do that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:55:18] you can cause python to have memory errors from pure python!
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edgar-rft	[18:55:34] no, it doesn't care about heap corruption because it's Python :-)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:55:36] you can probably even get code execution out of some of them, but i haven't, not really my area
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:55:44] pyzozord: it puts explicit checks on things, and then does the C++ thing of generating runtime objects and walking the stack
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:56:32] Without any of the UB of C
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[18:57:23] I know, once you have a single UB your program might as well steal your bitcoins and crash
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:58:08] It's a very deliberate decision of Python to not have C-like UB and to instead have explicit checks and exceptions.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:58:22] from memory you can get a very straightforward buffer overflow out of types.CodeType
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:58:37] edk: or just from ctypes and then use C to do the bad thing
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:58:58] and there are some WONTFIX's in the interpreter like stackoverflows from unbounded recursion
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:58:58] yes, but that wouldn't be using pure python
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[18:59:12] edk: well define "pure Python", types.CodeType isn't "pure Python" either :P
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:59:21] sure it is, i can get it without importing anything
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[18:59:39] you could imagine a "sandboxed" python interpreter just not allowing you to use ctypes at all, but retaining the data model
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:00:41] so separate process is really the only way to be truly protected
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:00:46] edk: I mean the code objects don't have well-defined co_code attributes, they're just implementation defined black boxes really
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:00:50] and that applies for all languages
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:01:11] bjs: well obviously python-the-language doesn't have any implementation bugs, by definition
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:01:28] pyzozord: for security concerns too,  it means the library doesn't have access to your memory either which is good
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:01:36] pyzozord: and e.g. why your browser probably has separate processes for each tab
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:01:42] shame that this doesn't hold true for threads
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:01:53] i'm just saying the reference implementation does, and they've been known for years and never fixed, and you don't need any deliberate escape hatches to get to them
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:02:03] pyzozord: a thread (e.g. on unix) is really just a process that specifically has this bit turned off :)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:02:06] although wouldn't thread protect me against stack smashing/overflows/corruptions?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:02:08] otherwise they're the same
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:02:52] pyzozord: threads don't protect you very much against exploits because once an exploit gains control of one thread it can easily use that to do anything it likes to the other threads
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:02:54] bjs: the same as separate process or the same as the host process
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:03:14] threads are like separate processes except they share address space
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:03:22] pyzozord: no I mean if you're talking unix-y things then a "thread" and a "process" are the same thing underneath
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:03:33] pyzozord: the difference is 1 bit of the flags to clone()
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:04:15] so if I run the main program that spawns one extra thread. If that thread does heap corruption or segv, can I recover in my main program?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:04:23] pyzozord: no because it's in the same memory space
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:05:06] segv is the good case; you have an opportunity to exit as safely as you can and start a clean copy of yourself
2021-07-20 10:40:41	bjs	[19:05:16] anything in the same memory space is pretty much doomed because the "bad" program had access to all your memory and really could've done anything to it.  How likely it is to have done that highly depends on the program, what it was doing at the time, how badly it was broken, what compiler was used to compile it and what optimizations were enabled and what day of the week it was :P
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:05:23] but the thread can also screw you up with heap corruption or similar
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:06:59] ok, when my program crashes do I need to drop tcp connections?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:07:01] even if you did know there was something to recover it might not be possible; the information might simply have been destroyed
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:07:06] the OS will do that for you
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:07:15] is it possible that os will keep the connections alive until my program reboots?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:07:22] no
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:07:47] it may leave the sockets around depending on the socket options and the OS and the OS settings and what the other end does, but it won't give them to the next copy of your program
2021-07-20 10:40:41	edk	[19:08:01] really keeping connections open when you crash is much more work than closing them
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pyzozord	[19:16:21] ok, thank you everyone who participated in the discussion to help me. I've learned new things.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:36:06] and here's an improved version of my ADPCM encoder
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:36:10] https://bpa.st/KP2HIELDM7GDSPLVEAS4G5RAJ4
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:36:29] including a decoder that doesn't generate an easily-playable file
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:36:29] https://bpa.st/SJR2LQLA4ZP4Q535C234TR7JIA
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[19:37:49] thats the really low bitrate one that only encodes delta values so uses way less bits?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[19:38:03] nice i like delta encoding
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:38:24] eyynet4: i don't really understand your question
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:38:29] beaky: thanks
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:39:19] all of the code you're seeing here is based on DVI IMA ADPCM spec that's floating around the internet for years
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[19:40:05] delta == difference
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[19:40:08] change
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:42:58] i changed "delta" to "difference" before in the encoder code
2021-07-20 10:40:41	ITD4004	[19:43:18] it generated files that the decoder file put out as terribad to listen to
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[19:43:49] nice, i need to implement the mu-law format still myself.  i was banking on signed 16bit LE being ubiquitous
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[19:58:06] is Consolas the best programming font in existence?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[19:58:14] nayyyy
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[19:59:06] open source pro is too wide
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[19:59:11] inconsolata is too narrow
2021-07-20 10:40:41	quippy	[20:03:19] sounds like personal preference to me
2021-07-20 10:40:41	quippy	[20:03:27] Goldilocks

2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[20:08:41] eyynet4, ah, a font for ants
2021-07-20 10:40:41	 *	pulse [20:08:48] picks up the magnifying glass
2021-07-20 10:40:41	TheRedRipper	[20:17:57] font for wat
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[20:18:08] ANTS!
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:19:21] yes the best font is bitmapped fonts like the default xterm font because it is bitmapped so it is always crisp
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:19:34] whereas consolas always looks blurry with bad antialiasing and color fringing
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:19:40] (or any other modren font)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[20:19:53] i would agree with that
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[20:19:57] if the default resolution was still 640x480
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:20:20] even in my 2160p monitor i use nice crisp sick bitmapped fonts
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[20:20:37] do you use a telescope
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:20:58] no i just like the tiny crisp text i can have everything side-by-side
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:23:53] though my favorite non bitmapped font is iosevka because of how condensed it is (so i can fit so much side-by-side) https://typeof.net/Iosevka/
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:24:41] and also extremely customizable so if you like it but for instance hate the ligatures or prefer the zeroes or m's to look differently like another font then you can tweak it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	TheRedRipper	[20:25:10] beaky: i like Motter Tektura
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:25:55] nice i have to check that out
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:28:00] the numbers look too
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:30:35] pulse: I too only run bitmapped / hinted fonts as well
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:30:46] I cannot stand anti-aliasing (which actually is aliasing) on fonts
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:30:57] ESPECIALLY not Microsoft's cleartype *puke*
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:31:26] yes aliasing is the worst
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:32:18] pulse: if you've never seen what a 1080p anti-alias free setup looks like, here you go: https://i.imgur.com/dc0U4os.png
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:33:20] I would argue that bitmapped and fonts with special hinting data are actually easier to see at a distance
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[20:35:04] uh, i much prefer the aliased look
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pulse	[20:35:13] antialiased*
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:35:21] A properly made font will have bitmap strikes (a series of bitmaps for each size generally up until 16 pt) and other fonts somehow have special hinting data or something to fall back on that retain sharpness
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:35:48] *shrug* some people do, or don't even notice it as they have cotton buds in their eyes--but I've always just hated fonts that are smoothed over
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:36:47] https://i.imgur.com/6bGGrjT.png mmmm I love the fonts on AIX
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:37:19] If only all UNIX environments had that out of box
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:40:29] see it is nice and crisp
2021-07-20 10:40:41	TheRedRipper	[20:40:34] wa
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:41:22] the only reason i dont use bitmap fonts is because they dont display all the unicode i use like emoji
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:43:25] beaky: well the font I'm using on linux isn't technically a bitmap font, but it has extra data that makes it sharp at certain sizes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:43:29] (and it does have emojis)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:43:48] yes i thinkt aht is the best of both worlds
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:44:35] i havent gone full 'disable all anti aliasing' because then all of the web will look very ugly
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:44:52] beaky: that's why you use firefox so you can enforce one font
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:45:03] beaky: also when you say emoji support, I immediately thought of this https://i.redd.it/cozohvgr2h7z.png
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:45:04] but i like having websites choose their own font i like diversity
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[20:45:12] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:45:16] I hate the awful fonts websites use
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:45:29] The font designers today need to be taken outside and put down
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:45:49] (If I could force the world to use Helvetica as the sole font, I would :3 )
2021-07-20 10:40:41	micrex22	[20:46:12] Some of the open source google fonts are just about the ugliest things I've ever seen
2021-07-20 10:40:41	AbleBacon	[20:55:56] is there a C# / .NET channel?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[20:57:01] why tho, i mean there probably is one
2021-07-20 10:40:41	AbleBacon	[20:58:32] what do you mean why? i have a C# / .NET question :(
2021-07-20 10:40:41	AbleBacon	[20:58:50] i'm trying to pass a C++/CLI "array<System::Byte>^" to a C# program as a "byte[]", but it comes out as length 1, even though i'm ensuring that the "array<System::Byte>^" is longer than that--and that one byte is always the correct first byte of the array... what's going on here, or is there a better channel to ask about this?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	AbleBacon	[20:58:56] ^^^ if you guys happen to know the answer :-/
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[21:01:35] wow they let oyou pass arrays from c++ to C# seamlessly somehow?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[21:02:03] it's c++/cli like a microsoftified c++
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[21:03:07] like an extension to their generic implementation?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[21:07:49] one that runs under the clr
2021-07-20 10:40:41	AbleBacon	[21:11:42] it's NOT seamless at all and is kind of a nightmare
2021-07-20 10:40:41	AbleBacon	[21:12:41] i have my C code that runs 'gstreamer' and it NEEDS to be unadulterated, so i have a visual studio project for that. then i have a project with C++/CLI wrappers for the C stuff and it has all the microsoft language addons. then i have ANOTHER project that defines an interface between the C++ and C# stuff. then yet ANOTHER project with the actual C# code
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[21:24:02] can't you just give it a memory address and use a mutex or whatever ms calls it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[21:28:37] or is c# one of those languages that don't believe in memory addresses
2021-07-20 10:40:41	TheLinuxNerd	[21:30:16] eyynet4 IntPtr :-)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	TheLinuxNerd	[21:31:40] eyynet4 what I'd do, is use the C++ project to create a PInvoke compatible DLL for the gstreamer
2021-07-20 10:40:41	TheLinuxNerd	[21:31:46] a wrapper
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[21:34:29] what i'd do is just never use c# because now you are in the business of platform specifics
2021-07-20 10:40:41	AbleBacon	[21:35:51] i hadn't tried using an IntPtr... not sure C# will let me convert that to an array
2021-07-20 10:40:41	AbleBacon	[21:36:41] System::String^ works fine, so i don't know why it hates byte arrays
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest2379	[21:51:24] In C++, how do I read each line of a plain text file and add up all the numbers without using an array?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Thedarkb-Desktop	[21:55:43] Add each line you read in to a running total?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	Thedarkb-Desktop	[21:55:51] Assuming each number is on its own line.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[21:59:03] you can do it without an arry using streams and iterators https://ideone.com/YWohcJ
2021-07-20 10:40:41	InPhase	[22:04:51] guest2379: loop, std::getline, parse, iterative tally.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:11:39] why would you do that though
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[22:12:21] useful if you want to process an infinite stream of numbers
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[22:13:44] (but even with streams it can be efficient to buffer and process with simd
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:15:10] it's going to be a pain trying to convert string to "number" without using an array
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:15:15] really not worth it IMO
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:16:49] unless you store the index and rewind
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:17:13] number_start_idx
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:19:11] thats probably going to be a 64bit file offset, so 8 characters worth of "not-an-array"
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:19:27] then llseek systemcall overhead on e.g. linux
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:32:28] If you have n input numbers up to m bits each, you can add them up with only O(m log n) space instead of O(nm).
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:33:07] I think that's what's really behind restrictions like "without using an array"
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[22:37:42] PlanckWalk, by just considering two terms at a time?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[22:37:50] ie s+=n[i]
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:38:07] I'm assuming the input is a stream, but basically yes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pikapika	[22:38:49] and therefore the O() of memory involved is decided by the maximum size of the result
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:38:56] Though the "+=" hides a lot of arbitrary-size-integer complexity
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:39:21] max size could be infinite though !
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:40:28] Also I'm assuming the input stream is some form of symbol sequence, not "native" integers.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:41:13] yeah its "plain text"
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:41:33] basically its a nonsensical question without knowing these parameters of interest
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:41:47] Indeed.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[22:42:11] is it an x y probem
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:42:28] It's probably something like "the input is at most 2 billion natural numbers, each less than 2 billion.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:42:35] (Implied or explicitly stated)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[22:43:33] imagine the calamity if they were signed integers but they didn't mention if two's compliment or some other encoding of negative numbers
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[22:44:03] If the input stream is characters, I'd expect the usual prefixed "-"
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[22:54:42] besides linear types (rust) and gradual typing (typescript) what are some other recent ideas from programming language theory that are gaining popularity i always feel that programming language theory is like the least successful cs subdiscipline because bret victor says that plt researchers only think about either teaching lagnuages, type theory (which only programming language theorists
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[22:54:44] care about), and compiler implementation
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[22:56:04] or things like lean which are not what bret victor would call 'languages for scientists' but which might interest mathematicians but mathematicians arent interested in the plt bits in themselves but in getting their work 'formalized'
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[23:17:34] except for julia
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[23:22:11] julia is the next big thing in scientific computing
2021-07-20 10:40:41	pavonia	[23:54:07] Feminists would slap you in the face for this statement
2021-07-20 10:40:41	CuriousErnestBro	[00:06:54] how dare you call julia a "
2021-07-20 10:40:41	CuriousErnestBro	[00:06:59] "big thing"?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[00:13:05] it lets you progam efficient numerical computing codes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[00:13:14] but in a much more expressive way with more modern notation and stuff
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[00:15:43] imagine python but with the speed of fortran and the expressiveness of lisp
2021-07-20 10:40:41	CuriousErnestBro	[00:33:27] but doesn't R do the same beaky?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[00:33:43] yes but julia is much more better and modern
2021-07-20 10:40:41	CuriousErnestBro	[00:33:46] vectorization

2021-07-20 10:40:41	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:31] I now use python or R for all my quant (finance) needs
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[00:34:49] nope i dont know economics
2021-07-20 10:40:41	CuriousErnestBro	[00:36:32] beaky I bet julia doesn't have something like this! https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PortfolioAnalytics/versions/1.1.0/topics/PortfolioAnalytics-package
2021-07-20 10:40:41	CuriousErnestBro	[00:36:48] beaky me neither but it looks a well put together book
2021-07-20 10:40:41	CuriousErnestBro	[00:37:07] that's a lie, I call myself an econometrician so I know a little about that I suppose
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[00:43:03] the problem with R is
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[00:43:13] the programmers just dont 'get it'
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[00:43:25] im not sure what it is, but R doesnt have it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[00:43:57] hadley wickham is an embarrassment
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[00:46:22] wheres the multiprocessing libraries, package manager, version control, functional programming influence (beyond the superficial), consinstency or standards?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[00:46:34] and whats with the memory limits and stuff? idk bro
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[00:46:44] guess I just dont get R

2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[01:42:58] hello soulisson im beaky
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[01:45:37] could someone please take a look at this and give me a hint at what im doing wrong? https://bpa.st/MMYA
2021-07-20 10:40:41	WarauSalesman	[01:47:48] guest3290: you need a C++ book
2021-07-20 10:40:41	WarauSalesman	[01:47:54] you are doing lots of wrong things
2021-07-20 10:40:41	soulisson	[01:48:19] how are you beaky?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[01:48:28] do you have a book you would recommend?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	WarauSalesman	[01:48:32] guest3290: actually, you don't even know how to code. how did you come up with that thing?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	WarauSalesman	[01:48:52] guest3290: you can join ##C++ or ##C++-general for more advice. then you can type !books in one of these channels
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[01:49:48] okay. thank you.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[01:49:52] I know I'm really bad.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[01:52:03] you dont have to list everything, but can you please tell me a few things im doing that are wrong.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	WarauSalesman	[01:53:08] declaration and definition of functions should have the same/similar signature
2021-07-20 10:40:41	WarauSalesman	[01:56:17] guest3290: you seem to be throwing random stuff and expecting it to compile for some reason
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[02:00:54] guest3290: switch to irssi irc client too for time being (it'll help you get more familiar with command-line and become a better programmer)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	JaneyDoe	[02:01:06] at least for 6 months
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:01:18] JaneyDoe: That's an opinion.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[02:01:58] i use weechat sometimes but on this computer i use hexchat
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:02:23] I second the recommendation to get a good book.  Hexchat is a perfectly fine, and popular, IRC client.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:13:06] It's almost a bit curious, but C++'s language ecosystem really does need books.  You can get away without a good book in several other language ecosystems.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[02:13:40] https://bpa.st/AWOA
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[02:14:25] WarauSalesman: i got it working in just main without any functions or class. im going to get a C++ book and read up on functions and classes.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[02:14:52] what C++ book do you guys recommend?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	eyynet4	[02:16:07] c++ would be like a 10 part megaseries on DVD
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:20:27] guest3290: The #c++ nolyc bot recommends this list: http://stackoverflow.com/q/388242/1090079
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:22:12] guest3290: Personal recommendation is to see what your local and university libraries have as far as that list is concerned.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	guest3290	[02:22:30] thank you
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:23:55] guest3290: Especially in the "beginner" level (which really aren't that beginner, really, imho).  My personal favorite is always "The Design and Evolution of C++", it's completely out of date and not relevant for modern C++, but it gives enormous insight into understanding how and why C++ is the way it is.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:24:37] (Don't use it to learn C++!  Just to get an appreciation of the history)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:48:43] Am I ascertaiing this correctly?.. In a linked list - I can not use size (size of list) in any logic to navigate the list because two numbers both represent the same position? Namely size 0, while it may mean the list is empty, represents the head of the list; and, size 1, while it may represent there being one node in the list, also represents the head of the list.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:48:57] Am I understanding that right?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:49:05] blahboybaz: How are you calculating size?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:49:32] arahael: when a node is created, size++, when a node is deleted, size--
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:49:48] size = 0; at initialization
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:50:46] blahboybaz: And where is 'size' stored?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[02:50:51] It depends on how your design your linked list. Does the linked list have a 'meta object' that represents the list as a whole, or is it just a bunch of nodes with pointers to other nodes.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[02:50:54] ?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:51:11] vdamewood: Howdy!
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[02:51:20] arahael: G'day.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:51:26] arahael: It is a field in the class definition (outside the constructor but still in the class definition)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:51:36] private field
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:51:41] blahboybaz: Class definition of what?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[02:51:44] blahboybaz: It might help if you specify which language you're working with.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:52:05] vdamewood: javascript
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[02:52:19] Ah, yes. JavaScript 'classes'.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:52:49] There are 2 classes a Node class. And a List class. The list class (composes) the node class. I don't think it composes it exactly but it uses it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:52:55] no inheritance
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[02:54:09] So, then the List class would have the size value, and it should be zero if there are no nodes yet.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[02:54:19] Then once there is a node, then size would be 1.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:54:31] Fwiw, this is what I've been working with, testing, tweaking..  https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5snkxhf   <--   its a bit of a mess at the end with lines for some manual testing
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:55:28] vdamewood: yes but the only diff between and empty list and a list with one node in it is   this.head = new Node();
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:55:44] blahboybaz: I thought you said that you also do size++?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[02:55:57] (So that's another difference)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:56:56] arahael: I thought I did. There's 2 ways to make a list tho too. Can specify a size in the constructor and blast out a list at initialzation of the object or can create an object with empty list then add / remove nodes later
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[02:58:21] Oh, I guess if you initialize the object iwth a list I just set the size with whatever is passed into the constructor but doo size++ or size-- if you create/delete nodes after initialization
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[02:58:24] blahboybaz: Huh?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:00:20] It's a nightmare. My code is blowing up, ok, there, I admitted it. And I don't know why
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:00:53] blahboybaz: I don't get what you mean by the only difference is... what you said.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:01:21] I've spend the last 2 days (off and on) trying to figure it out and I don't see why it's acting the way it does. I wonder if I have some synchronicity problem but I'm so new to js I wouldn't know enough to see it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:01:31] I mean, yeah, ane empty list is going to have zero nodes, and a list with one node is going to have one node. That's expected.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:01:46] s/ane/an/
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[03:02:34] blahboybaz: Develop a short test case that explains the problem you have.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[03:02:51] blahboybaz: 'when you do this... You expect THIS, but you get THAT'.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:03:38] blahboybaz: You can probably streamline your constructor a little.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:03:47] vdamewood: When the list is empty and you create the first node all you do is  this.head = new Node();  (pretty much). So the size increases from 0 to 1 and  this.head just goes from null to containing a Node object.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:04:29] blahboybaz: Um. Yeah. So what's the problem?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:04:38] arahael: I can do that (develop a test case)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[03:04:53] blahboybaz: just to clarify, 'this.head = new Node()' is adding the first item onto the list?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:05:04] arahael: yes
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[03:05:18] So it now has 1 item in it...
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:07:35] https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5snkxhf  <--  It looks like the output that the list is empty is getting executed no matter what and the actual list item is not being output at all - may indicate a deeper issue
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:07:41] vdamewood:  ^
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:09:26] blahboybaz: On line 115, why do you check index == 0?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:09:29] arahael: Well I've done various tests. Iirc when I cerate a list at initialzation of the object things seem to work fine (I would have to verify that). But if I try to work with nodes later (initialize with an empty list then add / remove nodes later) then stuff goes haywire
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:11:23] When I wrote the code I thought that index = 0 means you are at the head of the lst (empty or not is a separate issue). So I check to see if you are at the head of the list && if there is a node there or not
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:11:33] Same with line 102.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[03:12:21] blahboybaz: What do you mean by "work with nodes later" - you mean, bypass your List class?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:12:23] But index is user input, you shouldn't asume it has anything to do with the structure of your class.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:12:42] yes 115 and 102 that was my logic to check position and whether the list was empty or not but now I'm not so sure that's right. Just maybe not right for a deeper reason than what it might seem
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:13:04] Also, if you check for index == 0, and node is instanceof Node, then you ignore the case where index !=0, but node is still not an instance of Node.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:13:38] So, if you try to do something to index 4 of a 4-element list, you've just tried to set null's data, which it doesn't have.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[03:13:39] Too many sources of truth. :(
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:13:39] arahael: There are 2 ways to create a list. You can either create a list when you initialize the list object or you can initialize the list object with no list items and add / remove them later (after initialization)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:15:25] Also, since your calling console.log insize printNode, you don't have to wrap your call to it in a console.log call.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:15:29] *you're
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:15:51] vdamewood: I have a validate() function for checking the index value against the list bounds but it is not seen in that paste (I have it locally in a separate file). As the one giving the input I'm being careful not to exceed the list bounds anywhere
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:16:23] I have to take time to read what is being said to me - I'm getting behind
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:16:26] blahboybaz: Well, I can only comment on the code I see. Still, it's terrible logic.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:17:35] vdamewood: I'm sure it is
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:18:13] Well, when you get that test case done, maybe I can help figure out what's going wrong.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:18:28] For now, there's just way too much going on.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:18:29] I"ll work on it
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:19:09] Have I ever mentioned how much I think the Contents directory in a .app is stupid?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:19:32] As in, why not just have the MacOS, Frameworks, and Resources directories right in the .app?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:20:02] And, you know, whatever else might be in there.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:22:03] Also, why is it the 'MacOS' directory, and not the 'Executable' directory or something like that?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:22:10] Okay. I think I'm done.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:25:32] Dear cat, no I will not cuddle with you right now.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:25:44] I'm busy cuddling with my computer.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	arahael	[03:37:49] Computers do not make great cuddle partners.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	dodo	[03:41:11] not with that attitude
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[03:41:43] so system f has undecidable type inference, so why dont lagnuages that use system f like haskell go all the way and just use dependent types which are also undecidable
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[03:44:52] beaky: Using the same principles as "everyone dies, so let's just kill everyone"? ;-)
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[03:45:28] lol
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[03:46:04] yes system f is good for polymorphism, but it is not obvious what dependent types are good for
2021-07-20 10:40:41	PlanckWalk	[03:48:05] On a related note, I wonder whether the set of Turing machines that provably halt is Turing-complete.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:49:07] Does the set of all sets include my TV set?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[03:58:09] I'm gonna work on this some more before I ask for help again. I think I see some things going on now (making test cases helpted). Thanks for talking with me about it. That helped a lot
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[03:59:36] blahboybaz: I have a suggestion.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[03:59:42] yes i think it is not turing complete because if they were turing complete then you'd have proofs that the turing machine halts for some problems but this would be impossible under rice's theorem i think so ex falso quolibet
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[04:01:50] blahboybaz: On line 25, you start an if/else block. Since the check for count == 0) will be true once, and only once, the first time it goes through, run this code before the while loop, and start count as 1.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[04:02:20] Then you can remove the if/else entirely and just add the additional nodes.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[04:02:42] no wait its nto because of the proofs that it is impsosbiel but because they are provably halting
2021-07-20 10:40:41	blahboybaz	[04:03:16] vdamewood: Let me examine that. Thanks
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[04:03:39] i just like the name rice's theorem i think of the food
2021-07-20 10:40:41	 *	vdamewood [04:03:54] hands beaky Sushi's theorem.
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[04:04:31] merĳn: Pikachu?
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[04:05:10] i msut now formalize this proof in coq to truly work it out
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[04:08:55] to formalize this i need dependent types
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[04:10:13] the set of all provably-halting turing machines has a type that need some tea to figure out how to express, and to be able to say they are provably halting i need pi types a kind of dependent type
2021-07-20 10:40:41	beaky	[04:11:14] then i must formalize rice's theorem
2021-07-20 10:40:41	vdamewood	[04:15:05] Chicken and rice sounds nice.

2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[17:54:31] they kinda don't make any sense to me at first, but after a while you learn
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[17:54:32] the one's from the 80s and 90s would discuss 4-5 languages
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[17:54:48] not sure if that's the focus from the newer ones
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[17:54:59] stuff like mergesort is pretty intuitive to me nowdays
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[17:55:29] as for data structures, there is the compiler approach like wirth, or just have it be completely seperate
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[17:55:50] I would like to do more data strcutures as well, but to be honest you only need a few
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[17:56:10] i'd still look it up though, just in case. sometimes i wonder if a sort function hides multiple functions inside and chooses one depending on the amount of data to sort
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[17:57:11] for me dijkstra is intuitive, dont really understand why people are intimidated by it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[17:57:35] the algorithm?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[17:57:40] fwiw a lot of my experience is just hands on stuf
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[17:57:49] the biggest part of it is the piority queue, and that's done with the binary heap, and i dont remember those thing it does with bubble up and sink down or whatever
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[17:57:55] but otherwise it quite simple
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[17:58:08] i am very likely to fail a lot of actual implementations, but speaking about them theoretically makes sense to me nowdays
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[17:59:24] interestingly enough how you implement data structures is kinda limited by more abstract languages
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:00:04] abstractions are.. dunno how to say it, make hard things easy but easy things hard?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[18:00:31] can you do data strucutres in assembly?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:00:47] you're right, i used the wrong idiom
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[18:01:00] user51: they make poking about the computer more difficult
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:01:02] assembly is kinda interesting sometimes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:01:34] in a sense that you have little programs connected to the larger one
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:02:35] in essense you could argue that many languages apply but the structure of asm makes it much easier to see
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:03:07] damn, i just made a shift-reduce conflict in the last two messages
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:04:51] are C++ coroutines "alright", or are there any signifiicant gotchas, let's say performance-wise?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	TheRedRipper	[18:05:26] µµ
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[18:06:13] koo6: why would there be?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:06:50] maybethe implementations (gcc, llvm) could still be immature? idk
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:07:08] just figured i'd fish around before diving into them
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[18:07:49] that's just weird tbh
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:08:46] oh well
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:10:55] Oh that reminds me. I started the subject yesterday, but I have more questions. Is it possible to write C code that that if crashes instead of stopping the program it just jumps to some other instruction? I know that programs: segment fault, stack overflow, divide by 0. I guess there are other reasons why program crash. But if I'm not mistaken they are all just handled as os signals. So it seems
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:11:01] reasonable that I had my own handlers for those signals that do not stop execution. Essentially a try/catach
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:12:02] I wanted that so that I can safely run .so code without crashing my main program
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:12:31] pyzozord: it depends on what "crash" means
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:12:52] i wouldn't call that safe
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:12:55] pyzozord: most "crashes" are caused because you did some bad thing in C that was unrecoverable (like accessing memory you were not allowed) and it's the OS that killed you, not the C program choosing to quit
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:13:26] https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_signal_handling.htm
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Guest2949	[18:13:26] pyzozordI think you may be able to use setjmp and longjmp to handle that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:13:48] Guest2949: yeah I was thinking about longjmp too
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:14:19] bjs: is it that os kills you or os sends you signal "hey, chill" and kills you if you don't?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[18:14:48] straight up killin ur process
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:15:06] pyzozord: it depends.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:15:28] pyzozord: some things are signals you can handle and jump out of (although, exactly what state the machine is in at that point is unclear, especially for a C program)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:15:59] some things are straight-up killed without the OS even asking first (e.g. OOM is typically this)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Guest2949	[18:16:06] Hmmm
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:16:15] bjs: what else kills you?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Guest2949	[18:16:17] That's a good point.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Guest2949	[18:16:23] LOL pyzozord
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:16:54] pyzozord: well the OS can send signals like SIGSEGV and SIGILL when the process does a "bad" thing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[18:17:17] yes i like sigbus too i imagine a bus coming a stopping by
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:17:19] bjs: so I can't not die when I get segv?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:18:40] pyzozord: you can keep the process alive (sometimes) but like I said, and especially when it's a C program, the state of the machine is often very unclear
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[18:18:46] you can handle it and not die i think but sigkill in particular is where u get striaght'up killed (its what the out of memory killer thing does)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[18:19:19] or if you use kill -9 the only kill command everyone uses
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[18:19:24] because nobody uses sigstop
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:19:44] that's fine when they want me dead I should die
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[18:19:46] or sigterm to ask the process nicely to stop (thats the one you can handle)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:19:51] I just don't wanna die because of internal problems
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:19:55] pyzozord: imagine you `*x = 1; read(*y)`  now if you get a SIGSEGV on reading y, you might think that the write of x already happened but that's not probably not true. and infact the entire state could just be a total mess
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:20:13] probably not true*
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:20:46] bjs: yeah I get that part I think that's not a problem
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[18:20:51] yes with signals it might not be possible to decide causality that u might be looking for
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:22:20] i would want to do something like setjmp(); if (do_unsafe_so_stuff()) { /*jump here if so crashed us*/ handle_error } all_cool_here_carry_on()
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:22:59] im probably using setjmp wrong
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:24:28] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10202941/segmentation-fault-handling
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:24:53] pyzozord: the most robust way is usually to do the unsafe library stuff in a separate process, maybe mmap some space so it can give you back data
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:25:02] it really seems to be retying the instruction .. interesting
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:25:06] and if it goes wrong then you can just discard the space and drop the process and
2021-07-20 11:28:45	koo6	[18:25:14] ^
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:25:18] oh hmm nice idea
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:25:24] c syntax can be fun tho
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:25:26] just unsafe process
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:25:51] *(pointer = &var) = something(&pointer)[0];
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:25:58] unsafe so server process
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:26:22] could do parallelism that way too
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:28:02] user51: Pretty sure that's UB.  :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:28:16] InPhase: really? didn't know
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:28:33] user51: Assignment is not a sequence point, so the order is not specified for left and right there.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:29:15] how does c++ implement the try/catch stuff
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:29:17] user51: It's left undefined for optimization purposes, but that slams it into UB if you modify something used on the other side.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:29:29] will it even catch segfaults and divisions by zero?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:29:37] undefined foreign optimization
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:30:37] InPhase: my thought process was that the rightmost side gets evaluated first, then the resulting value is assigned
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:30:38] pyzozord: it does checks before you do certain operations, and if you do a bad thing it walks up the stack to find a try/catch and it stores a bit of information on the stack that lets it walk back up
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:30:39] pyzozord: Officially in C++, no.  But you can setup signal handlers on an implementation-specific basis that convert those signals into exception throws.  I've done this for segfault logging.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:32:04] pyzozord: It's pretty nice to get a stack trace report out of release builds of C++ for a segfault.  It just requires platform-specific code.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	user51	[18:32:33] i wonder if enron would have liked undefined behavior
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:33:05] pyzozord: it's basically entirely a software thing,  the software does checks, creates an exception object and then walks the stack to find a catch that matches it and if it does, it pops off and jumps there to continue. No OS signals or anything involved
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:34:00] bjs: I see so those are just runtime checks injected by c++
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:34:13] InPhase: ok so that sounds almost perfect
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:34:23] (except I prefer c instead of c++)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:35:01] pyzozord: Yes.  Standard exceptions are basically just code insertion like bjs said.  What it's about is cleaning up the code so that code is focused on the positive-path and is much cleaner.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:35:23] ok so sounds like that idea of set a jump, do unsafe code, if it triggers a segv, handle the segv, in the segv do the longjmp
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:35:26] will work, right?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:35:32] pyzozord: Also there's the important benefit that exceptions guarantee errors are handled somewhere.  Errors do not get ignored.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:35:37] pyzozord: saying it will "work" might be going far
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:35:41] it won't immediately kill the process
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:35:46] pyzozord: Many many many C bugs are due to missed or skipped error checking.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:35:59] in very many cases you're likely to just get another SIGV immediately after
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:36:44] pyzozord: In any large C++ program intended to be robust, you assume exceptions will happen, and you put catch-all handlers at opportune recovery points to deal with this in a useful manner.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:37:20] pyzozord: Then for the ones you can handle locally with a better recovery, you add an additional catch.  But your catch-alls handle everything else, and you end up dealing with every error in some useful way.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:37:39] not convinced programs with catch-all handlers can claim to be robust, tbh
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:37:50] edk: More robust than the ones without this!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:37:57] that's debatable
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:38:09] if the exception isn't caught you'll at least know they went wrong
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:38:32] edk: Here's a simple program structure:  You push buttons to do stuff.  A catch-all should report, "That button press didn't work because:  ____"  Then return to where you can try another button press.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:38:39] InPhase: to provide context, that still the continuation of the idea from yesterday. I imagine a MUD game where I can create a new "script.so" and then assign it to some object in the running game. The game will then load the script.so, and execute it depending on the game logic. Whever the game executes something from the so I want to have that safety even if the script.so segvs, it doesn't take
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:38:45] down the entire game with it, the game just handles it somehow, forexample unloading the .so and logging the error somewhere
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:39:06] InPhase: right, but for all you know the button press did half of something
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:39:42] maybe it's rotated an x-ray target out of the way but not switched off a power circuit
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:39:44] edk: If you used scope-based resource management with a structure that planned ahead for exceptions, that will all be handled automatically at the stack unwinding.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:40:02] resource management will be. you can't manage state that way
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:40:10] edk: Scope-based resource management should be comprehensive throughout the program design.  Exception handling is central to architecture, and not an afterthought.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:40:28] edk: a C program probably literally cannot claim such a thing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:40:36] a Python program probably could be robust in such errors :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:40:53] i claim python is equivalent in robustness to C
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:41:06] edk: If you're used to C programming, then this sort of recovery during unwinding is unthinkable.  But designing FOR it in C++ makes it straightforward.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:41:16] edk: C's UB means you cannot recover at all though
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:41:20] all I'm really hoping for to get the kind of robustness python has in C
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:41:26] whereas in Python you theoretically could, depending on the circumstances
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:42:09] if something goes horribly wrong then so be it, but I think I never really experienced anything else then stack overflows and segmentation faults my entire life
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:42:16] once you've triggered UB you're screwed but i'm not convinced you can meaningfully recover from logic errors anyway, all python (or rust)-style safety gives you is more guarantees about the consequences of those errors
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:42:23] bjs: Python is a little trickier to recover from errors with catch-alls because you don't get deterministic destruction.  So you have to be more careful with state recovery, and include more catches.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:42:26] it can't protect the state of your program
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:42:46] 'course, rust also gives you better tools to avoid those errors than either of the other two
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:42:48] InPhase: well it's the other way around surely, if you have a C program with UB you *cannot* recover
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:42:53] there is literally no way in C to get out of UB
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:43:00] Exceptions are not for handling UB.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:43:08] InPhase: i feel like you're in write-only mode
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:43:23] InPhase: okay but handling UB is basically what pyzozord is trying to do
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:43:23] Exceptions CAN handle logic errors, data quality errors, and hardware errors just fine though.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:43:52] everything you've said is about resource management, which is fine, but doesn't encapsulate everything programs need to be consistent about
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:44:25] And I volunteered that I've mapped segfaults to exceptions before.  But I only do that for logging and reporting purposes.  I treat segfault exceptions as fatal errors when I do this, because you really can't trust program state after you've allowed UB to occur.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:44:30] if i'm halfway through changing the state of a system and i throw an exception, there's no amount of raii that can help
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:45:04] edk: I mean it depends on the system :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:45:16] imagine you screw up an IRC server, you can just delete the database for example :D
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:45:39] well in general, that system needs to be reset to a consistent state, and in order to know to reset the system in question you needed to expect me to throw an exception while mutating it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:45:48] a catchall higher up won't do
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:46:01] You can do a best-effort unwind, but it's unwise to continue even if you've caught and handled a segfault.  Probably 9 times out of 10 you really could recover in practice, but I wouldn't trust it.  I might attempt differently if lives were on the line for a program crash.  But it's not something you can rely on.  Regular exceptions can be implemented in a completely reliable manner with full trust
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[18:46:07] in the unwind and recovery.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:47:07] edk: sure but the difference between Python and C is that Python lets you see that something went wrong and attempt to do something about it. You may not be able in all cases to get back to where you were exactly, but Python at least will allow you to try. My database example is a bit tongue-in-cheek but certainly is an example
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:48:06] and there are various ways of doing checkpointing so that you can "recover" back to a previous consistent state. The point I'm making is that a single C program just cannot do that if there's UB, at least not in a way that also isn't just UB itself ;)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:48:18] bjs: right, but catching specific errors in python is, from some angles, equivalent to "don't make mistakes" in C, which is to say inadequate
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:49:39] edk: no it's not the same,  in C the compiler is allowed to just assume SIGSEGV never happens, it could detect your SIGSEGV handler and NOP it out, it could delete 1/2 your program.  The Python program would at least guarantee you hit an exception handler and be in a consistent state (that is, a consistent *interpreter* state) from which you can actually execute new code reliably
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:49:46] exceptions because of exceptional conditions are something else; they're doing what you do with return values in C. which leaves us with logic errors and so on. if you expect an exception to be thrown because of a specific logic error, just omit the logic error
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:50:03] are you guys talking about memory state when segv occures? That wouldn't be a problem. The "host" program would wipe all the memory that unsafe code used
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:50:49] those .so "plugins" will be delt specific amount of memory for themselves and could modify "host" state only via host function, which from the perspective of the plugin are essntially atomic
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:50:50] pyzozord: if that program was e.g. a library call, then it had access to *your* memory, and it was using *your* stack
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:50:58] bjs: or if you're not protecting againt a specific logic error you're trying to protect against any arbitrary logic error that might happen, but you can't, because it might leave your program in some kind of wonky state
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:51:09] and *your* compiler was allowed to assume that the library call didn't SEGV, so maybe your program is now in an inconsistent state too
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:51:18] I can foresee many things going wrong with this ...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:51:22] recovery may be possible but there is no hope for you of knowing how to recover because you don't know why you're handling an exception
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:51:24] bjs: yeah true, but those would be fairly simple plugins they woul not have any io of their own
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:51:32] pyzozord: plugins?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:52:25] I do get what you mean about memory state though, it's good to mention that, but I think in this case it woul be ok, since I would be writing those plugins myself
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:52:42] it's essentially there to not crash the host program because I made a typo etc
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:52:49] pyzozord: imagine the library went `printf(*NULL); int* x; *x = 42`  <- if you call this program from your program, you may find that part of *your* memory now has 42 in it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:53:08] pyzozord: if you cause heap corruption in a plugin it will be essentially impossible to recover
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:53:46] Oh i see, I do think I've caused some corruptions before
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:54:06] pyzozord: if the library does a bad thing, it could affect you if you're in the same process.  This is why modern systems do things in separate processes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:54:39] yes sounds like separate process is much safer
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:54:51] so how does python handle situations like this?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:55:00] it doesn't
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:55:02] I guess it doesn't care about heap corruption because it's interpreted?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:55:13] pyzozord: not because it's interpreted, but because it's designed to just not let you do that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:55:18] you can cause python to have memory errors from pure python!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edgar-rft	[18:55:34] no, it doesn't care about heap corruption because it's Python :-)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:55:36] you can probably even get code execution out of some of them, but i haven't, not really my area
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:55:44] pyzozord: it puts explicit checks on things, and then does the C++ thing of generating runtime objects and walking the stack
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:56:32] Without any of the UB of C
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[18:57:23] I know, once you have a single UB your program might as well steal your bitcoins and crash
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:58:08] It's a very deliberate decision of Python to not have C-like UB and to instead have explicit checks and exceptions.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:58:22] from memory you can get a very straightforward buffer overflow out of types.CodeType
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:58:37] edk: or just from ctypes and then use C to do the bad thing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:58:58] and there are some WONTFIX's in the interpreter like stackoverflows from unbounded recursion
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:58:58] yes, but that wouldn't be using pure python
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[18:59:12] edk: well define "pure Python", types.CodeType isn't "pure Python" either :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:59:21] sure it is, i can get it without importing anything
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[18:59:39] you could imagine a "sandboxed" python interpreter just not allowing you to use ctypes at all, but retaining the data model
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:00:41] so separate process is really the only way to be truly protected
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:00:46] edk: I mean the code objects don't have well-defined co_code attributes, they're just implementation defined black boxes really
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:00:50] and that applies for all languages
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:01:11] bjs: well obviously python-the-language doesn't have any implementation bugs, by definition
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:01:28] pyzozord: for security concerns too,  it means the library doesn't have access to your memory either which is good
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:01:36] pyzozord: and e.g. why your browser probably has separate processes for each tab
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:01:42] shame that this doesn't hold true for threads
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:01:53] i'm just saying the reference implementation does, and they've been known for years and never fixed, and you don't need any deliberate escape hatches to get to them
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:02:03] pyzozord: a thread (e.g. on unix) is really just a process that specifically has this bit turned off :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:02:06] although wouldn't thread protect me against stack smashing/overflows/corruptions?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:02:08] otherwise they're the same
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:02:52] pyzozord: threads don't protect you very much against exploits because once an exploit gains control of one thread it can easily use that to do anything it likes to the other threads
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:02:54] bjs: the same as separate process or the same as the host process
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:03:14] threads are like separate processes except they share address space
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:03:22] pyzozord: no I mean if you're talking unix-y things then a "thread" and a "process" are the same thing underneath
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:03:33] pyzozord: the difference is 1 bit of the flags to clone()
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:04:15] so if I run the main program that spawns one extra thread. If that thread does heap corruption or segv, can I recover in my main program?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:04:23] pyzozord: no because it's in the same memory space
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:05:06] segv is the good case; you have an opportunity to exit as safely as you can and start a clean copy of yourself
2021-07-20 11:28:45	bjs	[19:05:16] anything in the same memory space is pretty much doomed because the "bad" program had access to all your memory and really could've done anything to it.  How likely it is to have done that highly depends on the program, what it was doing at the time, how badly it was broken, what compiler was used to compile it and what optimizations were enabled and what day of the week it was :P
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:05:23] but the thread can also screw you up with heap corruption or similar
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:06:59] ok, when my program crashes do I need to drop tcp connections?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:07:01] even if you did know there was something to recover it might not be possible; the information might simply have been destroyed
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:07:06] the OS will do that for you
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:07:15] is it possible that os will keep the connections alive until my program reboots?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:07:22] no
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:07:47] it may leave the sockets around depending on the socket options and the OS and the OS settings and what the other end does, but it won't give them to the next copy of your program
2021-07-20 11:28:45	edk	[19:08:01] really keeping connections open when you crash is much more work than closing them
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pyzozord	[19:16:21] ok, thank you everyone who participated in the discussion to help me. I've learned new things.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:36:06] and here's an improved version of my ADPCM encoder
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:36:10] https://bpa.st/KP2HIELDM7GDSPLVEAS4G5RAJ4
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:36:29] including a decoder that doesn't generate an easily-playable file
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:36:29] https://bpa.st/SJR2LQLA4ZP4Q535C234TR7JIA
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[19:37:49] thats the really low bitrate one that only encodes delta values so uses way less bits?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[19:38:03] nice i like delta encoding
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:38:24] eyynet4: i don't really understand your question
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:38:29] beaky: thanks
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:39:19] all of the code you're seeing here is based on DVI IMA ADPCM spec that's floating around the internet for years
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[19:40:05] delta == difference
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[19:40:08] change
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:42:58] i changed "delta" to "difference" before in the encoder code
2021-07-20 11:28:45	ITD4004	[19:43:18] it generated files that the decoder file put out as terribad to listen to
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[19:43:49] nice, i need to implement the mu-law format still myself.  i was banking on signed 16bit LE being ubiquitous
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[19:58:06] is Consolas the best programming font in existence?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[19:58:14] nayyyy
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[19:59:06] open source pro is too wide
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[19:59:11] inconsolata is too narrow
2021-07-20 11:28:45	quippy	[20:03:19] sounds like personal preference to me
2021-07-20 11:28:45	quippy	[20:03:27] Goldilocks

2021-07-20 11:28:45	 *	piou [20:08:31] likes terminus
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[20:08:41] eyynet4, ah, a font for ants
2021-07-20 11:28:45	 *	pulse [20:08:48] picks up the magnifying glass
2021-07-20 11:28:45	TheRedRipper	[20:17:57] font for wat
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[20:18:08] ANTS!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:19:21] yes the best font is bitmapped fonts like the default xterm font because it is bitmapped so it is always crisp
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:19:34] whereas consolas always looks blurry with bad antialiasing and color fringing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:19:40] (or any other modren font)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[20:19:53] i would agree with that
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[20:19:57] if the default resolution was still 640x480
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:20:20] even in my 2160p monitor i use nice crisp sick bitmapped fonts
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[20:20:37] do you use a telescope
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:20:58] no i just like the tiny crisp text i can have everything side-by-side
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:23:53] though my favorite non bitmapped font is iosevka because of how condensed it is (so i can fit so much side-by-side) https://typeof.net/Iosevka/
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:24:41] and also extremely customizable so if you like it but for instance hate the ligatures or prefer the zeroes or m's to look differently like another font then you can tweak it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	TheRedRipper	[20:25:10] beaky: i like Motter Tektura
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:25:55] nice i have to check that out
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:28:00] the numbers look too
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:30:35] pulse: I too only run bitmapped / hinted fonts as well
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:30:46] I cannot stand anti-aliasing (which actually is aliasing) on fonts
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:30:57] ESPECIALLY not Microsoft's cleartype *puke*
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:31:26] yes aliasing is the worst
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:32:18] pulse: if you've never seen what a 1080p anti-alias free setup looks like, here you go: https://i.imgur.com/dc0U4os.png
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:33:20] I would argue that bitmapped and fonts with special hinting data are actually easier to see at a distance
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[20:35:04] uh, i much prefer the aliased look
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pulse	[20:35:13] antialiased*
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:35:21] A properly made font will have bitmap strikes (a series of bitmaps for each size generally up until 16 pt) and other fonts somehow have special hinting data or something to fall back on that retain sharpness
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:35:48] *shrug* some people do, or don't even notice it as they have cotton buds in their eyes--but I've always just hated fonts that are smoothed over
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:36:47] https://i.imgur.com/6bGGrjT.png mmmm I love the fonts on AIX
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:37:19] If only all UNIX environments had that out of box
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:40:29] see it is nice and crisp
2021-07-20 11:28:45	TheRedRipper	[20:40:34] wa
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:41:22] the only reason i dont use bitmap fonts is because they dont display all the unicode i use like emoji
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:43:25] beaky: well the font I'm using on linux isn't technically a bitmap font, but it has extra data that makes it sharp at certain sizes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:43:29] (and it does have emojis)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:43:48] yes i thinkt aht is the best of both worlds
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:44:35] i havent gone full 'disable all anti aliasing' because then all of the web will look very ugly
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:44:52] beaky: that's why you use firefox so you can enforce one font
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:45:03] beaky: also when you say emoji support, I immediately thought of this https://i.redd.it/cozohvgr2h7z.png
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:45:04] but i like having websites choose their own font i like diversity
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[20:45:12] lol
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:45:16] I hate the awful fonts websites use
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:45:29] The font designers today need to be taken outside and put down
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:45:49] (If I could force the world to use Helvetica as the sole font, I would :3 )
2021-07-20 11:28:45	micrex22	[20:46:12] Some of the open source google fonts are just about the ugliest things I've ever seen
2021-07-20 11:28:45	AbleBacon	[20:55:56] is there a C# / .NET channel?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[20:57:01] why tho, i mean there probably is one
2021-07-20 11:28:45	AbleBacon	[20:58:32] what do you mean why? i have a C# / .NET question :(
2021-07-20 11:28:45	AbleBacon	[20:58:50] i'm trying to pass a C++/CLI "array<System::Byte>^" to a C# program as a "byte[]", but it comes out as length 1, even though i'm ensuring that the "array<System::Byte>^" is longer than that--and that one byte is always the correct first byte of the array... what's going on here, or is there a better channel to ask about this?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	AbleBacon	[20:58:56] ^^^ if you guys happen to know the answer :-/
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[21:01:35] wow they let oyou pass arrays from c++ to C# seamlessly somehow?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[21:02:03] it's c++/cli like a microsoftified c++
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[21:03:07] like an extension to their generic implementation?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[21:07:49] one that runs under the clr
2021-07-20 11:28:45	AbleBacon	[21:11:42] it's NOT seamless at all and is kind of a nightmare
2021-07-20 11:28:45	AbleBacon	[21:12:41] i have my C code that runs 'gstreamer' and it NEEDS to be unadulterated, so i have a visual studio project for that. then i have a project with C++/CLI wrappers for the C stuff and it has all the microsoft language addons. then i have ANOTHER project that defines an interface between the C++ and C# stuff. then yet ANOTHER project with the actual C# code
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[21:24:02] can't you just give it a memory address and use a mutex or whatever ms calls it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[21:28:37] or is c# one of those languages that don't believe in memory addresses
2021-07-20 11:28:45	TheLinuxNerd	[21:30:16] eyynet4 IntPtr :-)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	TheLinuxNerd	[21:31:40] eyynet4 what I'd do, is use the C++ project to create a PInvoke compatible DLL for the gstreamer
2021-07-20 11:28:45	TheLinuxNerd	[21:31:46] a wrapper
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[21:34:29] what i'd do is just never use c# because now you are in the business of platform specifics
2021-07-20 11:28:45	AbleBacon	[21:35:51] i hadn't tried using an IntPtr... not sure C# will let me convert that to an array
2021-07-20 11:28:45	AbleBacon	[21:36:41] System::String^ works fine, so i don't know why it hates byte arrays
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest2379	[21:51:24] In C++, how do I read each line of a plain text file and add up all the numbers without using an array?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Thedarkb-Desktop	[21:55:43] Add each line you read in to a running total?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Thedarkb-Desktop	[21:55:51] Assuming each number is on its own line.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[21:59:03] you can do it without an arry using streams and iterators https://ideone.com/YWohcJ
2021-07-20 11:28:45	InPhase	[22:04:51] guest2379: loop, std::getline, parse, iterative tally.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:11:39] why would you do that though
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[22:12:21] useful if you want to process an infinite stream of numbers
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[22:13:44] (but even with streams it can be efficient to buffer and process with simd
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:15:10] it's going to be a pain trying to convert string to "number" without using an array
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:15:15] really not worth it IMO
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:16:49] unless you store the index and rewind
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:17:13] number_start_idx
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:19:11] thats probably going to be a 64bit file offset, so 8 characters worth of "not-an-array"
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:19:27] then llseek systemcall overhead on e.g. linux
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:32:28] If you have n input numbers up to m bits each, you can add them up with only O(m log n) space instead of O(nm).
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:33:07] I think that's what's really behind restrictions like "without using an array"
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[22:37:42] PlanckWalk, by just considering two terms at a time?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[22:37:50] ie s+=n[i]
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:38:07] I'm assuming the input is a stream, but basically yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pikapika	[22:38:49] and therefore the O() of memory involved is decided by the maximum size of the result
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:38:56] Though the "+=" hides a lot of arbitrary-size-integer complexity
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:39:21] max size could be infinite though !
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:40:28] Also I'm assuming the input stream is some form of symbol sequence, not "native" integers.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:41:13] yeah its "plain text"
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:41:33] basically its a nonsensical question without knowing these parameters of interest
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:41:47] Indeed.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[22:42:11] is it an x y probem
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:42:28] It's probably something like "the input is at most 2 billion natural numbers, each less than 2 billion.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:42:35] (Implied or explicitly stated)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[22:43:33] imagine the calamity if they were signed integers but they didn't mention if two's compliment or some other encoding of negative numbers
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[22:44:03] If the input stream is characters, I'd expect the usual prefixed "-"
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[22:54:42] besides linear types (rust) and gradual typing (typescript) what are some other recent ideas from programming language theory that are gaining popularity i always feel that programming language theory is like the least successful cs subdiscipline because bret victor says that plt researchers only think about either teaching lagnuages, type theory (which only programming language theorists
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[22:54:44] care about), and compiler implementation
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[22:56:04] or things like lean which are not what bret victor would call 'languages for scientists' but which might interest mathematicians but mathematicians arent interested in the plt bits in themselves but in getting their work 'formalized'
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[23:17:34] except for julia
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[23:22:11] julia is the next big thing in scientific computing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	pavonia	[23:54:07] Feminists would slap you in the face for this statement
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:06:54] how dare you call julia a "
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:06:59] "big thing"?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[00:13:05] it lets you progam efficient numerical computing codes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[00:13:14] but in a much more expressive way with more modern notation and stuff
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[00:15:43] imagine python but with the speed of fortran and the expressiveness of lisp
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:33:27] but doesn't R do the same beaky?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[00:33:43] yes but julia is much more better and modern
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:33:46] vectorization
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:13] I wanted to go through this for a long time: https://julia.quantecon.org/
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:17] do you know it beaky?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:31] I now use python or R for all my quant (finance) needs
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[00:34:49] nope i dont know economics
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:36:32] beaky I bet julia doesn't have something like this! https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PortfolioAnalytics/versions/1.1.0/topics/PortfolioAnalytics-package
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:36:48] beaky me neither but it looks a well put together book
2021-07-20 11:28:45	CuriousErnestBro	[00:37:07] that's a lie, I call myself an econometrician so I know a little about that I suppose
2021-07-20 11:28:45	JaneyDoe	[00:43:03] the problem with R is
2021-07-20 11:28:45	JaneyDoe	[00:43:13] the programmers just dont 'get it'

2021-07-20 11:28:45	JaneyDoe	[00:46:22] wheres the multiprocessing libraries, package manager, version control, functional programming influence (beyond the superficial), consinstency or standards?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	JaneyDoe	[00:46:34] and whats with the memory limits and stuff? idk bro
2021-07-20 11:28:45	JaneyDoe	[00:46:44] guess I just dont get R

2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[01:42:58] hello soulisson im beaky
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[01:45:37] could someone please take a look at this and give me a hint at what im doing wrong? https://bpa.st/MMYA
2021-07-20 11:28:45	WarauSalesman	[01:47:48] guest3290: you need a C++ book
2021-07-20 11:28:45	WarauSalesman	[01:47:54] you are doing lots of wrong things
2021-07-20 11:28:45	soulisson	[01:48:19] how are you beaky?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[01:48:28] do you have a book you would recommend?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	WarauSalesman	[01:48:32] guest3290: actually, you don't even know how to code. how did you come up with that thing?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	WarauSalesman	[01:48:52] guest3290: you can join ##C++ or ##C++-general for more advice. then you can type !books in one of these channels
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[01:49:48] okay. thank you.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[01:49:52] I know I'm really bad.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[01:52:03] you dont have to list everything, but can you please tell me a few things im doing that are wrong.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	WarauSalesman	[01:53:08] declaration and definition of functions should have the same/similar signature
2021-07-20 11:28:45	WarauSalesman	[01:56:17] guest3290: you seem to be throwing random stuff and expecting it to compile for some reason
2021-07-20 11:28:45	JaneyDoe	[02:00:54] guest3290: switch to irssi irc client too for time being (it'll help you get more familiar with command-line and become a better programmer)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	JaneyDoe	[02:01:06] at least for 6 months
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:01:18] JaneyDoe: That's an opinion.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[02:01:58] i use weechat sometimes but on this computer i use hexchat
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:02:23] I second the recommendation to get a good book.  Hexchat is a perfectly fine, and popular, IRC client.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:13:06] It's almost a bit curious, but C++'s language ecosystem really does need books.  You can get away without a good book in several other language ecosystems.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[02:13:40] https://bpa.st/AWOA
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[02:14:25] WarauSalesman: i got it working in just main without any functions or class. im going to get a C++ book and read up on functions and classes.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[02:14:52] what C++ book do you guys recommend?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	eyynet4	[02:16:07] c++ would be like a 10 part megaseries on DVD
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:20:27] guest3290: The #c++ nolyc bot recommends this list: http://stackoverflow.com/q/388242/1090079
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:22:12] guest3290: Personal recommendation is to see what your local and university libraries have as far as that list is concerned.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	guest3290	[02:22:30] thank you
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:23:55] guest3290: Especially in the "beginner" level (which really aren't that beginner, really, imho).  My personal favorite is always "The Design and Evolution of C++", it's completely out of date and not relevant for modern C++, but it gives enormous insight into understanding how and why C++ is the way it is.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:24:37] (Don't use it to learn C++!  Just to get an appreciation of the history)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:48:43] Am I ascertaiing this correctly?.. In a linked list - I can not use size (size of list) in any logic to navigate the list because two numbers both represent the same position? Namely size 0, while it may mean the list is empty, represents the head of the list; and, size 1, while it may represent there being one node in the list, also represents the head of the list.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:48:57] Am I understanding that right?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:49:05] blahboybaz: How are you calculating size?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:49:32] arahael: when a node is created, size++, when a node is deleted, size--
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:49:48] size = 0; at initialization
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:50:46] blahboybaz: And where is 'size' stored?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[02:50:51] It depends on how your design your linked list. Does the linked list have a 'meta object' that represents the list as a whole, or is it just a bunch of nodes with pointers to other nodes.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[02:50:54] ?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:51:11] vdamewood: Howdy!
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[02:51:20] arahael: G'day.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:51:26] arahael: It is a field in the class definition (outside the constructor but still in the class definition)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:51:36] private field
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:51:41] blahboybaz: Class definition of what?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[02:51:44] blahboybaz: It might help if you specify which language you're working with.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:52:05] vdamewood: javascript
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[02:52:19] Ah, yes. JavaScript 'classes'.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:52:49] There are 2 classes a Node class. And a List class. The list class (composes) the node class. I don't think it composes it exactly but it uses it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:52:55] no inheritance
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[02:54:09] So, then the List class would have the size value, and it should be zero if there are no nodes yet.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[02:54:19] Then once there is a node, then size would be 1.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:54:31] Fwiw, this is what I've been working with, testing, tweaking..  https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5snkxhf   <--   its a bit of a mess at the end with lines for some manual testing
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:55:28] vdamewood: yes but the only diff between and empty list and a list with one node in it is   this.head = new Node();
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:55:44] blahboybaz: I thought you said that you also do size++?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[02:55:57] (So that's another difference)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:56:56] arahael: I thought I did. There's 2 ways to make a list tho too. Can specify a size in the constructor and blast out a list at initialzation of the object or can create an object with empty list then add / remove nodes later
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[02:58:21] Oh, I guess if you initialize the object iwth a list I just set the size with whatever is passed into the constructor but doo size++ or size-- if you create/delete nodes after initialization
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[02:58:24] blahboybaz: Huh?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:00:20] It's a nightmare. My code is blowing up, ok, there, I admitted it. And I don't know why
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:00:53] blahboybaz: I don't get what you mean by the only difference is... what you said.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:01:21] I've spend the last 2 days (off and on) trying to figure it out and I don't see why it's acting the way it does. I wonder if I have some synchronicity problem but I'm so new to js I wouldn't know enough to see it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:01:31] I mean, yeah, ane empty list is going to have zero nodes, and a list with one node is going to have one node. That's expected.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:01:46] s/ane/an/
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[03:02:34] blahboybaz: Develop a short test case that explains the problem you have.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[03:02:51] blahboybaz: 'when you do this... You expect THIS, but you get THAT'.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:03:38] blahboybaz: You can probably streamline your constructor a little.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:03:47] vdamewood: When the list is empty and you create the first node all you do is  this.head = new Node();  (pretty much). So the size increases from 0 to 1 and  this.head just goes from null to containing a Node object.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:04:29] blahboybaz: Um. Yeah. So what's the problem?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:04:38] arahael: I can do that (develop a test case)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[03:04:53] blahboybaz: just to clarify, 'this.head = new Node()' is adding the first item onto the list?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:05:04] arahael: yes
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[03:05:18] So it now has 1 item in it...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:07:35] https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5snkxhf  <--  It looks like the output that the list is empty is getting executed no matter what and the actual list item is not being output at all - may indicate a deeper issue
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:07:41] vdamewood:  ^
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:09:26] blahboybaz: On line 115, why do you check index == 0?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:09:29] arahael: Well I've done various tests. Iirc when I cerate a list at initialzation of the object things seem to work fine (I would have to verify that). But if I try to work with nodes later (initialize with an empty list then add / remove nodes later) then stuff goes haywire
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:11:23] When I wrote the code I thought that index = 0 means you are at the head of the lst (empty or not is a separate issue). So I check to see if you are at the head of the list && if there is a node there or not
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:11:33] Same with line 102.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[03:12:21] blahboybaz: What do you mean by "work with nodes later" - you mean, bypass your List class?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:12:23] But index is user input, you shouldn't asume it has anything to do with the structure of your class.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:12:42] yes 115 and 102 that was my logic to check position and whether the list was empty or not but now I'm not so sure that's right. Just maybe not right for a deeper reason than what it might seem
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:13:04] Also, if you check for index == 0, and node is instanceof Node, then you ignore the case where index !=0, but node is still not an instance of Node.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:13:38] So, if you try to do something to index 4 of a 4-element list, you've just tried to set null's data, which it doesn't have.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[03:13:39] Too many sources of truth. :(
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:13:39] arahael: There are 2 ways to create a list. You can either create a list when you initialize the list object or you can initialize the list object with no list items and add / remove them later (after initialization)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:15:25] Also, since your calling console.log insize printNode, you don't have to wrap your call to it in a console.log call.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:15:29] *you're
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:15:51] vdamewood: I have a validate() function for checking the index value against the list bounds but it is not seen in that paste (I have it locally in a separate file). As the one giving the input I'm being careful not to exceed the list bounds anywhere
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:16:23] I have to take time to read what is being said to me - I'm getting behind
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:16:26] blahboybaz: Well, I can only comment on the code I see. Still, it's terrible logic.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:17:35] vdamewood: I'm sure it is
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:18:13] Well, when you get that test case done, maybe I can help figure out what's going wrong.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:18:28] For now, there's just way too much going on.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:18:29] I"ll work on it
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:19:09] Have I ever mentioned how much I think the Contents directory in a .app is stupid?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:19:32] As in, why not just have the MacOS, Frameworks, and Resources directories right in the .app?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:20:02] And, you know, whatever else might be in there.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:22:03] Also, why is it the 'MacOS' directory, and not the 'Executable' directory or something like that?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:22:10] Okay. I think I'm done.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:25:32] Dear cat, no I will not cuddle with you right now.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:25:44] I'm busy cuddling with my computer.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	arahael	[03:37:49] Computers do not make great cuddle partners.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	dodo	[03:41:11] not with that attitude
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[03:41:43] so system f has undecidable type inference, so why dont lagnuages that use system f like haskell go all the way and just use dependent types which are also undecidable
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[03:44:52] beaky: Using the same principles as "everyone dies, so let's just kill everyone"? ;-)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[03:45:28] lol
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[03:46:04] yes system f is good for polymorphism, but it is not obvious what dependent types are good for
2021-07-20 11:28:45	PlanckWalk	[03:48:05] On a related note, I wonder whether the set of Turing machines that provably halt is Turing-complete.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:49:07] Does the set of all sets include my TV set?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[03:58:09] I'm gonna work on this some more before I ask for help again. I think I see some things going on now (making test cases helpted). Thanks for talking with me about it. That helped a lot
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[03:59:36] blahboybaz: I have a suggestion.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[03:59:42] yes i think it is not turing complete because if they were turing complete then you'd have proofs that the turing machine halts for some problems but this would be impossible under rice's theorem i think so ex falso quolibet
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[04:01:50] blahboybaz: On line 25, you start an if/else block. Since the check for count == 0) will be true once, and only once, the first time it goes through, run this code before the while loop, and start count as 1.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[04:02:20] Then you can remove the if/else entirely and just add the additional nodes.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[04:02:42] no wait its nto because of the proofs that it is impsosbiel but because they are provably halting
2021-07-20 11:28:45	blahboybaz	[04:03:16] vdamewood: Let me examine that. Thanks
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[04:03:39] i just like the name rice's theorem i think of the food
2021-07-20 11:28:45	 *	vdamewood [04:03:54] hands beaky Sushi's theorem.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[04:04:31] merĳn: Pikachu?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[04:05:10] i msut now formalize this proof in coq to truly work it out
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[04:08:55] to formalize this i need dependent types
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[04:10:13] the set of all provably-halting turing machines has a type that need some tea to figure out how to express, and to be able to say they are provably halting i need pi types a kind of dependent type
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[04:11:14] then i must formalize rice's theorem
2021-07-20 11:28:45	vdamewood	[04:15:05] Chicken and rice sounds nice.
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[05:32:51] In a Hamming Error Correction Code, what is a parity bit? I get the idea of an additional parity bit for a single word, but there is some trick where bit positions that are powers of 2 become parity bits? What does that mean?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[05:49:30] yes your data is a string of bits, and you can number each bit 0, 1, 2, and so on... those numbers are also called "bit positions", and the algorithm defines those bit positions that are powers of two as the parity bits
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[05:50:43] so bit #0 is not a parity bit, bit #1 is not a parity bit, bit #2 is the first parity bit, bit #3 is not a parity bit, .... bit #8 is the second parity bit, and so on...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[05:50:51] no wait it starts from one
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[05:51:10] so bit #1 is not a parity bit, bit #2 is the first parity bit, bit #3 is not a parity bit, .... bit #8 is the second parity bit, and so on...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[05:51:25] no wait
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[05:52:11] the parity bits are powers of 2 remember? :)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[05:52:22] bit 1,2,4,8 ...
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[05:52:25] right powers of two (starting with the least significant bit) bit #1 is a parity bit, bit #2 is also a parity bit, but bit #3 is not a parity bit (its not a power of 2), but then bit #4 is a parity bit
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[05:52:55] right, what does it mean to "check" on of those bits?
2021-07-20 11:28:45	Izem	[05:53:41] let me see if I can draw something in text
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[05:53:45] to check on them you xor and if the xor is not zero then you know the corrupt bit (and also can correct it)
2021-07-20 11:28:45	beaky	[05:54:18] but if there's more than one corrupted bit then i think it doesnt correct it

2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[17:54:31] they kinda don't make any sense to me at first, but after a while you learn
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[17:54:32] the one's from the 80s and 90s would discuss 4-5 languages
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[17:54:48] not sure if that's the focus from the newer ones
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[17:54:59] stuff like mergesort is pretty intuitive to me nowdays
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[17:55:29] as for data structures, there is the compiler approach like wirth, or just have it be completely seperate
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[17:55:50] I would like to do more data strcutures as well, but to be honest you only need a few
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[17:56:10] i'd still look it up though, just in case. sometimes i wonder if a sort function hides multiple functions inside and chooses one depending on the amount of data to sort
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[17:57:11] for me dijkstra is intuitive, dont really understand why people are intimidated by it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[17:57:35] the algorithm?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[17:57:40] fwiw a lot of my experience is just hands on stuf
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[17:57:49] the biggest part of it is the piority queue, and that's done with the binary heap, and i dont remember those thing it does with bubble up and sink down or whatever
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[17:57:55] but otherwise it quite simple
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[17:58:08] i am very likely to fail a lot of actual implementations, but speaking about them theoretically makes sense to me nowdays
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[17:59:24] interestingly enough how you implement data structures is kinda limited by more abstract languages
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:00:04] abstractions are.. dunno how to say it, make hard things easy but easy things hard?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[18:00:31] can you do data strucutres in assembly?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:00:47] you're right, i used the wrong idiom
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[18:01:00] user51: they make poking about the computer more difficult
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:01:02] assembly is kinda interesting sometimes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:01:34] in a sense that you have little programs connected to the larger one
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:02:35] in essense you could argue that many languages apply but the structure of asm makes it much easier to see
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:03:07] damn, i just made a shift-reduce conflict in the last two messages
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:04:51] are C++ coroutines "alright", or are there any signifiicant gotchas, let's say performance-wise?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	TheRedRipper	[18:05:26] µµ
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[18:06:13] koo6: why would there be?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:06:50] maybethe implementations (gcc, llvm) could still be immature? idk
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:07:08] just figured i'd fish around before diving into them
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[18:07:49] that's just weird tbh
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:08:46] oh well
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:10:55] Oh that reminds me. I started the subject yesterday, but I have more questions. Is it possible to write C code that that if crashes instead of stopping the program it just jumps to some other instruction? I know that programs: segment fault, stack overflow, divide by 0. I guess there are other reasons why program crash. But if I'm not mistaken they are all just handled as os signals. So it seems
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:11:01] reasonable that I had my own handlers for those signals that do not stop execution. Essentially a try/catach
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:12:02] I wanted that so that I can safely run .so code without crashing my main program
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:12:31] pyzozord: it depends on what "crash" means
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:12:52] i wouldn't call that safe
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:12:55] pyzozord: most "crashes" are caused because you did some bad thing in C that was unrecoverable (like accessing memory you were not allowed) and it's the OS that killed you, not the C program choosing to quit
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:13:26] https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_signal_handling.htm
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Guest2949	[18:13:26] pyzozordI think you may be able to use setjmp and longjmp to handle that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:13:48] Guest2949: yeah I was thinking about longjmp too
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:14:19] bjs: is it that os kills you or os sends you signal "hey, chill" and kills you if you don't?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[18:14:48] straight up killin ur process
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:15:06] pyzozord: it depends.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:15:28] pyzozord: some things are signals you can handle and jump out of (although, exactly what state the machine is in at that point is unclear, especially for a C program)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:15:59] some things are straight-up killed without the OS even asking first (e.g. OOM is typically this)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Guest2949	[18:16:06] Hmmm
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:16:15] bjs: what else kills you?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Guest2949	[18:16:17] That's a good point.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Guest2949	[18:16:23] LOL pyzozord
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:16:54] pyzozord: well the OS can send signals like SIGSEGV and SIGILL when the process does a "bad" thing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[18:17:17] yes i like sigbus too i imagine a bus coming a stopping by
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:17:19] bjs: so I can't not die when I get segv?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:18:40] pyzozord: you can keep the process alive (sometimes) but like I said, and especially when it's a C program, the state of the machine is often very unclear
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[18:18:46] you can handle it and not die i think but sigkill in particular is where u get striaght'up killed (its what the out of memory killer thing does)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[18:19:19] or if you use kill -9 the only kill command everyone uses
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[18:19:24] because nobody uses sigstop
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:19:44] that's fine when they want me dead I should die
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[18:19:46] or sigterm to ask the process nicely to stop (thats the one you can handle)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:19:51] I just don't wanna die because of internal problems
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:19:55] pyzozord: imagine you `*x = 1; read(*y)`  now if you get a SIGSEGV on reading y, you might think that the write of x already happened but that's not probably not true. and infact the entire state could just be a total mess
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:20:13] probably not true*
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:20:46] bjs: yeah I get that part I think that's not a problem
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[18:20:51] yes with signals it might not be possible to decide causality that u might be looking for
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:22:20] i would want to do something like setjmp(); if (do_unsafe_so_stuff()) { /*jump here if so crashed us*/ handle_error } all_cool_here_carry_on()
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:22:59] im probably using setjmp wrong
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:24:28] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10202941/segmentation-fault-handling
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:24:53] pyzozord: the most robust way is usually to do the unsafe library stuff in a separate process, maybe mmap some space so it can give you back data
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:25:02] it really seems to be retying the instruction .. interesting
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:25:06] and if it goes wrong then you can just discard the space and drop the process and
2021-07-20 11:29:00	koo6	[18:25:14] ^
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:25:18] oh hmm nice idea
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:25:24] c syntax can be fun tho
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:25:26] just unsafe process
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:25:51] *(pointer = &var) = something(&pointer)[0];
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:25:58] unsafe so server process
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:26:22] could do parallelism that way too
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:28:02] user51: Pretty sure that's UB.  :)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:28:16] InPhase: really? didn't know
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:28:33] user51: Assignment is not a sequence point, so the order is not specified for left and right there.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:29:15] how does c++ implement the try/catch stuff
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:29:17] user51: It's left undefined for optimization purposes, but that slams it into UB if you modify something used on the other side.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:29:29] will it even catch segfaults and divisions by zero?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:29:37] undefined foreign optimization
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:30:37] InPhase: my thought process was that the rightmost side gets evaluated first, then the resulting value is assigned
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:30:38] pyzozord: it does checks before you do certain operations, and if you do a bad thing it walks up the stack to find a try/catch and it stores a bit of information on the stack that lets it walk back up
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:30:39] pyzozord: Officially in C++, no.  But you can setup signal handlers on an implementation-specific basis that convert those signals into exception throws.  I've done this for segfault logging.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:32:04] pyzozord: It's pretty nice to get a stack trace report out of release builds of C++ for a segfault.  It just requires platform-specific code.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	user51	[18:32:33] i wonder if enron would have liked undefined behavior
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:33:05] pyzozord: it's basically entirely a software thing,  the software does checks, creates an exception object and then walks the stack to find a catch that matches it and if it does, it pops off and jumps there to continue. No OS signals or anything involved
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:34:00] bjs: I see so those are just runtime checks injected by c++
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:34:13] InPhase: ok so that sounds almost perfect
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:34:23] (except I prefer c instead of c++)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:35:01] pyzozord: Yes.  Standard exceptions are basically just code insertion like bjs said.  What it's about is cleaning up the code so that code is focused on the positive-path and is much cleaner.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:35:23] ok so sounds like that idea of set a jump, do unsafe code, if it triggers a segv, handle the segv, in the segv do the longjmp
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:35:26] will work, right?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:35:32] pyzozord: Also there's the important benefit that exceptions guarantee errors are handled somewhere.  Errors do not get ignored.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:35:37] pyzozord: saying it will "work" might be going far
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:35:41] it won't immediately kill the process
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:35:46] pyzozord: Many many many C bugs are due to missed or skipped error checking.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:35:59] in very many cases you're likely to just get another SIGV immediately after
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:36:44] pyzozord: In any large C++ program intended to be robust, you assume exceptions will happen, and you put catch-all handlers at opportune recovery points to deal with this in a useful manner.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:37:20] pyzozord: Then for the ones you can handle locally with a better recovery, you add an additional catch.  But your catch-alls handle everything else, and you end up dealing with every error in some useful way.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:37:39] not convinced programs with catch-all handlers can claim to be robust, tbh
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:37:50] edk: More robust than the ones without this!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:37:57] that's debatable
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:38:09] if the exception isn't caught you'll at least know they went wrong
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:38:32] edk: Here's a simple program structure:  You push buttons to do stuff.  A catch-all should report, "That button press didn't work because:  ____"  Then return to where you can try another button press.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:38:39] InPhase: to provide context, that still the continuation of the idea from yesterday. I imagine a MUD game where I can create a new "script.so" and then assign it to some object in the running game. The game will then load the script.so, and execute it depending on the game logic. Whever the game executes something from the so I want to have that safety even if the script.so segvs, it doesn't take
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:38:45] down the entire game with it, the game just handles it somehow, forexample unloading the .so and logging the error somewhere
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:39:06] InPhase: right, but for all you know the button press did half of something
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:39:42] maybe it's rotated an x-ray target out of the way but not switched off a power circuit
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:39:44] edk: If you used scope-based resource management with a structure that planned ahead for exceptions, that will all be handled automatically at the stack unwinding.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:40:02] resource management will be. you can't manage state that way
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:40:10] edk: Scope-based resource management should be comprehensive throughout the program design.  Exception handling is central to architecture, and not an afterthought.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:40:28] edk: a C program probably literally cannot claim such a thing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:40:36] a Python program probably could be robust in such errors :)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:40:53] i claim python is equivalent in robustness to C
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:41:06] edk: If you're used to C programming, then this sort of recovery during unwinding is unthinkable.  But designing FOR it in C++ makes it straightforward.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:41:16] edk: C's UB means you cannot recover at all though
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:41:20] all I'm really hoping for to get the kind of robustness python has in C
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:41:26] whereas in Python you theoretically could, depending on the circumstances
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:42:09] if something goes horribly wrong then so be it, but I think I never really experienced anything else then stack overflows and segmentation faults my entire life
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:42:16] once you've triggered UB you're screwed but i'm not convinced you can meaningfully recover from logic errors anyway, all python (or rust)-style safety gives you is more guarantees about the consequences of those errors
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:42:23] bjs: Python is a little trickier to recover from errors with catch-alls because you don't get deterministic destruction.  So you have to be more careful with state recovery, and include more catches.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:42:26] it can't protect the state of your program
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:42:46] 'course, rust also gives you better tools to avoid those errors than either of the other two
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:42:48] InPhase: well it's the other way around surely, if you have a C program with UB you *cannot* recover
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:42:53] there is literally no way in C to get out of UB
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:43:00] Exceptions are not for handling UB.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:43:08] InPhase: i feel like you're in write-only mode
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:43:23] InPhase: okay but handling UB is basically what pyzozord is trying to do
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:43:23] Exceptions CAN handle logic errors, data quality errors, and hardware errors just fine though.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:43:52] everything you've said is about resource management, which is fine, but doesn't encapsulate everything programs need to be consistent about
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:44:25] And I volunteered that I've mapped segfaults to exceptions before.  But I only do that for logging and reporting purposes.  I treat segfault exceptions as fatal errors when I do this, because you really can't trust program state after you've allowed UB to occur.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:44:30] if i'm halfway through changing the state of a system and i throw an exception, there's no amount of raii that can help
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:45:04] edk: I mean it depends on the system :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:45:16] imagine you screw up an IRC server, you can just delete the database for example :D
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:45:39] well in general, that system needs to be reset to a consistent state, and in order to know to reset the system in question you needed to expect me to throw an exception while mutating it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:45:48] a catchall higher up won't do
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:46:01] You can do a best-effort unwind, but it's unwise to continue even if you've caught and handled a segfault.  Probably 9 times out of 10 you really could recover in practice, but I wouldn't trust it.  I might attempt differently if lives were on the line for a program crash.  But it's not something you can rely on.  Regular exceptions can be implemented in a completely reliable manner with full trust
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[18:46:07] in the unwind and recovery.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:47:07] edk: sure but the difference between Python and C is that Python lets you see that something went wrong and attempt to do something about it. You may not be able in all cases to get back to where you were exactly, but Python at least will allow you to try. My database example is a bit tongue-in-cheek but certainly is an example
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:48:06] and there are various ways of doing checkpointing so that you can "recover" back to a previous consistent state. The point I'm making is that a single C program just cannot do that if there's UB, at least not in a way that also isn't just UB itself ;)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:48:18] bjs: right, but catching specific errors in python is, from some angles, equivalent to "don't make mistakes" in C, which is to say inadequate
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:49:39] edk: no it's not the same,  in C the compiler is allowed to just assume SIGSEGV never happens, it could detect your SIGSEGV handler and NOP it out, it could delete 1/2 your program.  The Python program would at least guarantee you hit an exception handler and be in a consistent state (that is, a consistent *interpreter* state) from which you can actually execute new code reliably
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:49:46] exceptions because of exceptional conditions are something else; they're doing what you do with return values in C. which leaves us with logic errors and so on. if you expect an exception to be thrown because of a specific logic error, just omit the logic error
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:50:03] are you guys talking about memory state when segv occures? That wouldn't be a problem. The "host" program would wipe all the memory that unsafe code used
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:50:49] those .so "plugins" will be delt specific amount of memory for themselves and could modify "host" state only via host function, which from the perspective of the plugin are essntially atomic
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:50:50] pyzozord: if that program was e.g. a library call, then it had access to *your* memory, and it was using *your* stack
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:50:58] bjs: or if you're not protecting againt a specific logic error you're trying to protect against any arbitrary logic error that might happen, but you can't, because it might leave your program in some kind of wonky state
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:51:09] and *your* compiler was allowed to assume that the library call didn't SEGV, so maybe your program is now in an inconsistent state too
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:51:18] I can foresee many things going wrong with this ...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:51:22] recovery may be possible but there is no hope for you of knowing how to recover because you don't know why you're handling an exception
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:51:24] bjs: yeah true, but those would be fairly simple plugins they woul not have any io of their own
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:51:32] pyzozord: plugins?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:52:25] I do get what you mean about memory state though, it's good to mention that, but I think in this case it woul be ok, since I would be writing those plugins myself
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:52:42] it's essentially there to not crash the host program because I made a typo etc
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:52:49] pyzozord: imagine the library went `printf(*NULL); int* x; *x = 42`  <- if you call this program from your program, you may find that part of *your* memory now has 42 in it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:53:08] pyzozord: if you cause heap corruption in a plugin it will be essentially impossible to recover
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:53:46] Oh i see, I do think I've caused some corruptions before
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:54:06] pyzozord: if the library does a bad thing, it could affect you if you're in the same process.  This is why modern systems do things in separate processes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:54:39] yes sounds like separate process is much safer
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:54:51] so how does python handle situations like this?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:55:00] it doesn't
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:55:02] I guess it doesn't care about heap corruption because it's interpreted?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:55:13] pyzozord: not because it's interpreted, but because it's designed to just not let you do that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:55:18] you can cause python to have memory errors from pure python!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edgar-rft	[18:55:34] no, it doesn't care about heap corruption because it's Python :-)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:55:36] you can probably even get code execution out of some of them, but i haven't, not really my area
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:55:44] pyzozord: it puts explicit checks on things, and then does the C++ thing of generating runtime objects and walking the stack
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:56:32] Without any of the UB of C
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[18:57:23] I know, once you have a single UB your program might as well steal your bitcoins and crash
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:58:08] It's a very deliberate decision of Python to not have C-like UB and to instead have explicit checks and exceptions.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:58:22] from memory you can get a very straightforward buffer overflow out of types.CodeType
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:58:37] edk: or just from ctypes and then use C to do the bad thing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:58:58] and there are some WONTFIX's in the interpreter like stackoverflows from unbounded recursion
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:58:58] yes, but that wouldn't be using pure python
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[18:59:12] edk: well define "pure Python", types.CodeType isn't "pure Python" either :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:59:21] sure it is, i can get it without importing anything
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[18:59:39] you could imagine a "sandboxed" python interpreter just not allowing you to use ctypes at all, but retaining the data model
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:00:41] so separate process is really the only way to be truly protected
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:00:46] edk: I mean the code objects don't have well-defined co_code attributes, they're just implementation defined black boxes really
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:00:50] and that applies for all languages
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:01:11] bjs: well obviously python-the-language doesn't have any implementation bugs, by definition
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:01:28] pyzozord: for security concerns too,  it means the library doesn't have access to your memory either which is good
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:01:36] pyzozord: and e.g. why your browser probably has separate processes for each tab
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:01:42] shame that this doesn't hold true for threads
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:01:53] i'm just saying the reference implementation does, and they've been known for years and never fixed, and you don't need any deliberate escape hatches to get to them
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:02:03] pyzozord: a thread (e.g. on unix) is really just a process that specifically has this bit turned off :)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:02:06] although wouldn't thread protect me against stack smashing/overflows/corruptions?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:02:08] otherwise they're the same
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:02:52] pyzozord: threads don't protect you very much against exploits because once an exploit gains control of one thread it can easily use that to do anything it likes to the other threads
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:02:54] bjs: the same as separate process or the same as the host process
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:03:14] threads are like separate processes except they share address space
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:03:22] pyzozord: no I mean if you're talking unix-y things then a "thread" and a "process" are the same thing underneath
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:03:33] pyzozord: the difference is 1 bit of the flags to clone()
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:04:15] so if I run the main program that spawns one extra thread. If that thread does heap corruption or segv, can I recover in my main program?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:04:23] pyzozord: no because it's in the same memory space
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:05:06] segv is the good case; you have an opportunity to exit as safely as you can and start a clean copy of yourself
2021-07-20 11:29:00	bjs	[19:05:16] anything in the same memory space is pretty much doomed because the "bad" program had access to all your memory and really could've done anything to it.  How likely it is to have done that highly depends on the program, what it was doing at the time, how badly it was broken, what compiler was used to compile it and what optimizations were enabled and what day of the week it was :P
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:05:23] but the thread can also screw you up with heap corruption or similar
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:06:59] ok, when my program crashes do I need to drop tcp connections?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:07:01] even if you did know there was something to recover it might not be possible; the information might simply have been destroyed
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:07:06] the OS will do that for you
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:07:15] is it possible that os will keep the connections alive until my program reboots?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:07:22] no
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:07:47] it may leave the sockets around depending on the socket options and the OS and the OS settings and what the other end does, but it won't give them to the next copy of your program
2021-07-20 11:29:00	edk	[19:08:01] really keeping connections open when you crash is much more work than closing them
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pyzozord	[19:16:21] ok, thank you everyone who participated in the discussion to help me. I've learned new things.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:36:06] and here's an improved version of my ADPCM encoder
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:36:10] https://bpa.st/KP2HIELDM7GDSPLVEAS4G5RAJ4
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:36:29] including a decoder that doesn't generate an easily-playable file
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:36:29] https://bpa.st/SJR2LQLA4ZP4Q535C234TR7JIA
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[19:37:49] thats the really low bitrate one that only encodes delta values so uses way less bits?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[19:38:03] nice i like delta encoding
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:38:24] eyynet4: i don't really understand your question
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:38:29] beaky: thanks
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:39:19] all of the code you're seeing here is based on DVI IMA ADPCM spec that's floating around the internet for years
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[19:40:05] delta == difference
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[19:40:08] change
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:42:58] i changed "delta" to "difference" before in the encoder code
2021-07-20 11:29:00	ITD4004	[19:43:18] it generated files that the decoder file put out as terribad to listen to
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[19:43:49] nice, i need to implement the mu-law format still myself.  i was banking on signed 16bit LE being ubiquitous
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[19:58:06] is Consolas the best programming font in existence?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[19:58:14] nayyyy
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[19:59:06] open source pro is too wide
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[19:59:11] inconsolata is too narrow
2021-07-20 11:29:00	quippy	[20:03:19] sounds like personal preference to me

2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[20:08:41] eyynet4, ah, a font for ants
2021-07-20 11:29:00	 *	pulse [20:08:48] picks up the magnifying glass
2021-07-20 11:29:00	TheRedRipper	[20:17:57] font for wat
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[20:18:08] ANTS!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:19:21] yes the best font is bitmapped fonts like the default xterm font because it is bitmapped so it is always crisp
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:19:34] whereas consolas always looks blurry with bad antialiasing and color fringing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:19:40] (or any other modren font)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[20:19:53] i would agree with that
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[20:19:57] if the default resolution was still 640x480
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:20:20] even in my 2160p monitor i use nice crisp sick bitmapped fonts
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[20:20:37] do you use a telescope
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:20:58] no i just like the tiny crisp text i can have everything side-by-side
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:23:53] though my favorite non bitmapped font is iosevka because of how condensed it is (so i can fit so much side-by-side) https://typeof.net/Iosevka/
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:24:41] and also extremely customizable so if you like it but for instance hate the ligatures or prefer the zeroes or m's to look differently like another font then you can tweak it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	TheRedRipper	[20:25:10] beaky: i like Motter Tektura
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:25:55] nice i have to check that out
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:28:00] the numbers look too
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:30:35] pulse: I too only run bitmapped / hinted fonts as well
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:30:46] I cannot stand anti-aliasing (which actually is aliasing) on fonts
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:30:57] ESPECIALLY not Microsoft's cleartype *puke*
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:31:26] yes aliasing is the worst
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:32:18] pulse: if you've never seen what a 1080p anti-alias free setup looks like, here you go: https://i.imgur.com/dc0U4os.png
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:33:20] I would argue that bitmapped and fonts with special hinting data are actually easier to see at a distance
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[20:35:04] uh, i much prefer the aliased look
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pulse	[20:35:13] antialiased*
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:35:21] A properly made font will have bitmap strikes (a series of bitmaps for each size generally up until 16 pt) and other fonts somehow have special hinting data or something to fall back on that retain sharpness
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:35:48] *shrug* some people do, or don't even notice it as they have cotton buds in their eyes--but I've always just hated fonts that are smoothed over
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:36:47] https://i.imgur.com/6bGGrjT.png mmmm I love the fonts on AIX
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:37:19] If only all UNIX environments had that out of box
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:40:29] see it is nice and crisp

2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:41:22] the only reason i dont use bitmap fonts is because they dont display all the unicode i use like emoji
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:43:25] beaky: well the font I'm using on linux isn't technically a bitmap font, but it has extra data that makes it sharp at certain sizes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:43:29] (and it does have emojis)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:43:48] yes i thinkt aht is the best of both worlds
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:44:35] i havent gone full 'disable all anti aliasing' because then all of the web will look very ugly
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:44:52] beaky: that's why you use firefox so you can enforce one font
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:45:03] beaky: also when you say emoji support, I immediately thought of this https://i.redd.it/cozohvgr2h7z.png
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:45:04] but i like having websites choose their own font i like diversity
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[20:45:12] lol
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:45:16] I hate the awful fonts websites use
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:45:29] The font designers today need to be taken outside and put down
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:45:49] (If I could force the world to use Helvetica as the sole font, I would :3 )
2021-07-20 11:29:00	micrex22	[20:46:12] Some of the open source google fonts are just about the ugliest things I've ever seen
2021-07-20 11:29:00	AbleBacon	[20:55:56] is there a C# / .NET channel?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[20:57:01] why tho, i mean there probably is one
2021-07-20 11:29:00	AbleBacon	[20:58:32] what do you mean why? i have a C# / .NET question :(
2021-07-20 11:29:00	AbleBacon	[20:58:50] i'm trying to pass a C++/CLI "array<System::Byte>^" to a C# program as a "byte[]", but it comes out as length 1, even though i'm ensuring that the "array<System::Byte>^" is longer than that--and that one byte is always the correct first byte of the array... what's going on here, or is there a better channel to ask about this?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	AbleBacon	[20:58:56] ^^^ if you guys happen to know the answer :-/
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[21:01:35] wow they let oyou pass arrays from c++ to C# seamlessly somehow?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[21:02:03] it's c++/cli like a microsoftified c++
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[21:03:07] like an extension to their generic implementation?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[21:07:49] one that runs under the clr
2021-07-20 11:29:00	AbleBacon	[21:11:42] it's NOT seamless at all and is kind of a nightmare
2021-07-20 11:29:00	AbleBacon	[21:12:41] i have my C code that runs 'gstreamer' and it NEEDS to be unadulterated, so i have a visual studio project for that. then i have a project with C++/CLI wrappers for the C stuff and it has all the microsoft language addons. then i have ANOTHER project that defines an interface between the C++ and C# stuff. then yet ANOTHER project with the actual C# code
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[21:24:02] can't you just give it a memory address and use a mutex or whatever ms calls it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[21:28:37] or is c# one of those languages that don't believe in memory addresses
2021-07-20 11:29:00	TheLinuxNerd	[21:30:16] eyynet4 IntPtr :-)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	TheLinuxNerd	[21:31:40] eyynet4 what I'd do, is use the C++ project to create a PInvoke compatible DLL for the gstreamer
2021-07-20 11:29:00	TheLinuxNerd	[21:31:46] a wrapper
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[21:34:29] what i'd do is just never use c# because now you are in the business of platform specifics
2021-07-20 11:29:00	AbleBacon	[21:35:51] i hadn't tried using an IntPtr... not sure C# will let me convert that to an array
2021-07-20 11:29:00	AbleBacon	[21:36:41] System::String^ works fine, so i don't know why it hates byte arrays
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest2379	[21:51:24] In C++, how do I read each line of a plain text file and add up all the numbers without using an array?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Thedarkb-Desktop	[21:55:43] Add each line you read in to a running total?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Thedarkb-Desktop	[21:55:51] Assuming each number is on its own line.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[21:59:03] you can do it without an arry using streams and iterators https://ideone.com/YWohcJ
2021-07-20 11:29:00	InPhase	[22:04:51] guest2379: loop, std::getline, parse, iterative tally.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:11:39] why would you do that though
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[22:12:21] useful if you want to process an infinite stream of numbers
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[22:13:44] (but even with streams it can be efficient to buffer and process with simd
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:15:10] it's going to be a pain trying to convert string to "number" without using an array
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:15:15] really not worth it IMO
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:16:49] unless you store the index and rewind
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:17:13] number_start_idx
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:19:11] thats probably going to be a 64bit file offset, so 8 characters worth of "not-an-array"
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:19:27] then llseek systemcall overhead on e.g. linux
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:32:28] If you have n input numbers up to m bits each, you can add them up with only O(m log n) space instead of O(nm).
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:33:07] I think that's what's really behind restrictions like "without using an array"
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[22:37:42] PlanckWalk, by just considering two terms at a time?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[22:37:50] ie s+=n[i]
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:38:07] I'm assuming the input is a stream, but basically yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pikapika	[22:38:49] and therefore the O() of memory involved is decided by the maximum size of the result
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:38:56] Though the "+=" hides a lot of arbitrary-size-integer complexity
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:39:21] max size could be infinite though !
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:40:28] Also I'm assuming the input stream is some form of symbol sequence, not "native" integers.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:41:13] yeah its "plain text"
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:41:33] basically its a nonsensical question without knowing these parameters of interest
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:41:47] Indeed.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[22:42:11] is it an x y probem
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:42:28] It's probably something like "the input is at most 2 billion natural numbers, each less than 2 billion.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:42:35] (Implied or explicitly stated)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[22:43:33] imagine the calamity if they were signed integers but they didn't mention if two's compliment or some other encoding of negative numbers
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[22:44:03] If the input stream is characters, I'd expect the usual prefixed "-"
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[22:54:42] besides linear types (rust) and gradual typing (typescript) what are some other recent ideas from programming language theory that are gaining popularity i always feel that programming language theory is like the least successful cs subdiscipline because bret victor says that plt researchers only think about either teaching lagnuages, type theory (which only programming language theorists
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[22:54:44] care about), and compiler implementation
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[22:56:04] or things like lean which are not what bret victor would call 'languages for scientists' but which might interest mathematicians but mathematicians arent interested in the plt bits in themselves but in getting their work 'formalized'
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[23:17:34] except for julia
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[23:22:11] julia is the next big thing in scientific computing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	pavonia	[23:54:07] Feminists would slap you in the face for this statement
2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:06:54] how dare you call julia a "
2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:06:59] "big thing"?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[00:13:05] it lets you progam efficient numerical computing codes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[00:13:14] but in a much more expressive way with more modern notation and stuff
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[00:15:43] imagine python but with the speed of fortran and the expressiveness of lisp
2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:33:27] but doesn't R do the same beaky?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[00:33:43] yes but julia is much more better and modern
2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:33:46] vectorization
2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:13] I wanted to go through this for a long time: https://julia.quantecon.org/

2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:34:31] I now use python or R for all my quant (finance) needs
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[00:34:49] nope i dont know economics
2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:36:32] beaky I bet julia doesn't have something like this! https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PortfolioAnalytics/versions/1.1.0/topics/PortfolioAnalytics-package
2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:36:48] beaky me neither but it looks a well put together book
2021-07-20 11:29:00	CuriousErnestBro	[00:37:07] that's a lie, I call myself an econometrician so I know a little about that I suppose
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[00:43:03] the problem with R is
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[00:43:13] the programmers just dont 'get it'
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[00:43:25] im not sure what it is, but R doesnt have it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[00:43:57] hadley wickham is an embarrassment
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[00:46:22] wheres the multiprocessing libraries, package manager, version control, functional programming influence (beyond the superficial), consinstency or standards?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[00:46:34] and whats with the memory limits and stuff? idk bro
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[00:46:44] guess I just dont get R

2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[01:45:37] could someone please take a look at this and give me a hint at what im doing wrong? https://bpa.st/MMYA
2021-07-20 11:29:00	WarauSalesman	[01:47:48] guest3290: you need a C++ book
2021-07-20 11:29:00	WarauSalesman	[01:47:54] you are doing lots of wrong things
2021-07-20 11:29:00	soulisson	[01:48:19] how are you beaky?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[01:48:28] do you have a book you would recommend?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	WarauSalesman	[01:48:32] guest3290: actually, you don't even know how to code. how did you come up with that thing?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	WarauSalesman	[01:48:52] guest3290: you can join ##C++ or ##C++-general for more advice. then you can type !books in one of these channels
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[01:49:48] okay. thank you.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[01:49:52] I know I'm really bad.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[01:52:03] you dont have to list everything, but can you please tell me a few things im doing that are wrong.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	WarauSalesman	[01:53:08] declaration and definition of functions should have the same/similar signature
2021-07-20 11:29:00	WarauSalesman	[01:56:17] guest3290: you seem to be throwing random stuff and expecting it to compile for some reason
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[02:00:54] guest3290: switch to irssi irc client too for time being (it'll help you get more familiar with command-line and become a better programmer)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	JaneyDoe	[02:01:06] at least for 6 months
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:01:18] JaneyDoe: That's an opinion.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[02:01:58] i use weechat sometimes but on this computer i use hexchat
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:02:23] I second the recommendation to get a good book.  Hexchat is a perfectly fine, and popular, IRC client.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:13:06] It's almost a bit curious, but C++'s language ecosystem really does need books.  You can get away without a good book in several other language ecosystems.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[02:13:40] https://bpa.st/AWOA
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[02:14:25] WarauSalesman: i got it working in just main without any functions or class. im going to get a C++ book and read up on functions and classes.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[02:14:52] what C++ book do you guys recommend?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	eyynet4	[02:16:07] c++ would be like a 10 part megaseries on DVD
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:20:27] guest3290: The #c++ nolyc bot recommends this list: http://stackoverflow.com/q/388242/1090079
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:22:12] guest3290: Personal recommendation is to see what your local and university libraries have as far as that list is concerned.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	guest3290	[02:22:30] thank you
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:23:55] guest3290: Especially in the "beginner" level (which really aren't that beginner, really, imho).  My personal favorite is always "The Design and Evolution of C++", it's completely out of date and not relevant for modern C++, but it gives enormous insight into understanding how and why C++ is the way it is.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:24:37] (Don't use it to learn C++!  Just to get an appreciation of the history)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:48:43] Am I ascertaiing this correctly?.. In a linked list - I can not use size (size of list) in any logic to navigate the list because two numbers both represent the same position? Namely size 0, while it may mean the list is empty, represents the head of the list; and, size 1, while it may represent there being one node in the list, also represents the head of the list.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:48:57] Am I understanding that right?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:49:05] blahboybaz: How are you calculating size?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:49:32] arahael: when a node is created, size++, when a node is deleted, size--
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:49:48] size = 0; at initialization
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:50:46] blahboybaz: And where is 'size' stored?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[02:50:51] It depends on how your design your linked list. Does the linked list have a 'meta object' that represents the list as a whole, or is it just a bunch of nodes with pointers to other nodes.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[02:50:54] ?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:51:11] vdamewood: Howdy!
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[02:51:20] arahael: G'day.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:51:26] arahael: It is a field in the class definition (outside the constructor but still in the class definition)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:51:36] private field
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:51:41] blahboybaz: Class definition of what?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[02:51:44] blahboybaz: It might help if you specify which language you're working with.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:52:05] vdamewood: javascript
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[02:52:19] Ah, yes. JavaScript 'classes'.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:52:49] There are 2 classes a Node class. And a List class. The list class (composes) the node class. I don't think it composes it exactly but it uses it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:52:55] no inheritance
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[02:54:09] So, then the List class would have the size value, and it should be zero if there are no nodes yet.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[02:54:19] Then once there is a node, then size would be 1.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:54:31] Fwiw, this is what I've been working with, testing, tweaking..  https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5snkxhf   <--   its a bit of a mess at the end with lines for some manual testing
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:55:28] vdamewood: yes but the only diff between and empty list and a list with one node in it is   this.head = new Node();
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:55:44] blahboybaz: I thought you said that you also do size++?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[02:55:57] (So that's another difference)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:56:56] arahael: I thought I did. There's 2 ways to make a list tho too. Can specify a size in the constructor and blast out a list at initialzation of the object or can create an object with empty list then add / remove nodes later
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[02:58:21] Oh, I guess if you initialize the object iwth a list I just set the size with whatever is passed into the constructor but doo size++ or size-- if you create/delete nodes after initialization
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[02:58:24] blahboybaz: Huh?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:00:20] It's a nightmare. My code is blowing up, ok, there, I admitted it. And I don't know why
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:00:53] blahboybaz: I don't get what you mean by the only difference is... what you said.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:01:21] I've spend the last 2 days (off and on) trying to figure it out and I don't see why it's acting the way it does. I wonder if I have some synchronicity problem but I'm so new to js I wouldn't know enough to see it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:01:31] I mean, yeah, ane empty list is going to have zero nodes, and a list with one node is going to have one node. That's expected.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:01:46] s/ane/an/
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[03:02:34] blahboybaz: Develop a short test case that explains the problem you have.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[03:02:51] blahboybaz: 'when you do this... You expect THIS, but you get THAT'.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:03:38] blahboybaz: You can probably streamline your constructor a little.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:03:47] vdamewood: When the list is empty and you create the first node all you do is  this.head = new Node();  (pretty much). So the size increases from 0 to 1 and  this.head just goes from null to containing a Node object.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:04:29] blahboybaz: Um. Yeah. So what's the problem?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:04:38] arahael: I can do that (develop a test case)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[03:04:53] blahboybaz: just to clarify, 'this.head = new Node()' is adding the first item onto the list?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:05:04] arahael: yes
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[03:05:18] So it now has 1 item in it...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:07:35] https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5snkxhf  <--  It looks like the output that the list is empty is getting executed no matter what and the actual list item is not being output at all - may indicate a deeper issue
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:07:41] vdamewood:  ^
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:09:26] blahboybaz: On line 115, why do you check index == 0?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:09:29] arahael: Well I've done various tests. Iirc when I cerate a list at initialzation of the object things seem to work fine (I would have to verify that). But if I try to work with nodes later (initialize with an empty list then add / remove nodes later) then stuff goes haywire
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:11:23] When I wrote the code I thought that index = 0 means you are at the head of the lst (empty or not is a separate issue). So I check to see if you are at the head of the list && if there is a node there or not
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:11:33] Same with line 102.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[03:12:21] blahboybaz: What do you mean by "work with nodes later" - you mean, bypass your List class?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:12:23] But index is user input, you shouldn't asume it has anything to do with the structure of your class.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:12:42] yes 115 and 102 that was my logic to check position and whether the list was empty or not but now I'm not so sure that's right. Just maybe not right for a deeper reason than what it might seem
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:13:04] Also, if you check for index == 0, and node is instanceof Node, then you ignore the case where index !=0, but node is still not an instance of Node.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:13:38] So, if you try to do something to index 4 of a 4-element list, you've just tried to set null's data, which it doesn't have.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[03:13:39] Too many sources of truth. :(
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:13:39] arahael: There are 2 ways to create a list. You can either create a list when you initialize the list object or you can initialize the list object with no list items and add / remove them later (after initialization)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:15:25] Also, since your calling console.log insize printNode, you don't have to wrap your call to it in a console.log call.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:15:29] *you're
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:15:51] vdamewood: I have a validate() function for checking the index value against the list bounds but it is not seen in that paste (I have it locally in a separate file). As the one giving the input I'm being careful not to exceed the list bounds anywhere
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:16:23] I have to take time to read what is being said to me - I'm getting behind
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:16:26] blahboybaz: Well, I can only comment on the code I see. Still, it's terrible logic.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:17:35] vdamewood: I'm sure it is
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:18:13] Well, when you get that test case done, maybe I can help figure out what's going wrong.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:18:28] For now, there's just way too much going on.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:18:29] I"ll work on it
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:19:09] Have I ever mentioned how much I think the Contents directory in a .app is stupid?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:19:32] As in, why not just have the MacOS, Frameworks, and Resources directories right in the .app?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:20:02] And, you know, whatever else might be in there.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:22:03] Also, why is it the 'MacOS' directory, and not the 'Executable' directory or something like that?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:22:10] Okay. I think I'm done.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:25:32] Dear cat, no I will not cuddle with you right now.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:25:44] I'm busy cuddling with my computer.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	arahael	[03:37:49] Computers do not make great cuddle partners.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	dodo	[03:41:11] not with that attitude
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[03:41:43] so system f has undecidable type inference, so why dont lagnuages that use system f like haskell go all the way and just use dependent types which are also undecidable
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[03:44:52] beaky: Using the same principles as "everyone dies, so let's just kill everyone"? ;-)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[03:45:28] lol
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[03:46:04] yes system f is good for polymorphism, but it is not obvious what dependent types are good for
2021-07-20 11:29:00	PlanckWalk	[03:48:05] On a related note, I wonder whether the set of Turing machines that provably halt is Turing-complete.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:49:07] Does the set of all sets include my TV set?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[03:58:09] I'm gonna work on this some more before I ask for help again. I think I see some things going on now (making test cases helpted). Thanks for talking with me about it. That helped a lot
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[03:59:36] blahboybaz: I have a suggestion.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[03:59:42] yes i think it is not turing complete because if they were turing complete then you'd have proofs that the turing machine halts for some problems but this would be impossible under rice's theorem i think so ex falso quolibet
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[04:01:50] blahboybaz: On line 25, you start an if/else block. Since the check for count == 0) will be true once, and only once, the first time it goes through, run this code before the while loop, and start count as 1.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[04:02:20] Then you can remove the if/else entirely and just add the additional nodes.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[04:02:42] no wait its nto because of the proofs that it is impsosbiel but because they are provably halting
2021-07-20 11:29:00	blahboybaz	[04:03:16] vdamewood: Let me examine that. Thanks
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[04:03:39] i just like the name rice's theorem i think of the food
2021-07-20 11:29:00	 *	vdamewood [04:03:54] hands beaky Sushi's theorem.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[04:04:31] merĳn: Pikachu?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[04:05:10] i msut now formalize this proof in coq to truly work it out
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[04:08:55] to formalize this i need dependent types
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[04:10:13] the set of all provably-halting turing machines has a type that need some tea to figure out how to express, and to be able to say they are provably halting i need pi types a kind of dependent type
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[04:11:14] then i must formalize rice's theorem
2021-07-20 11:29:00	vdamewood	[04:15:05] Chicken and rice sounds nice.
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[05:32:51] In a Hamming Error Correction Code, what is a parity bit? I get the idea of an additional parity bit for a single word, but there is some trick where bit positions that are powers of 2 become parity bits? What does that mean?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[05:49:30] yes your data is a string of bits, and you can number each bit 0, 1, 2, and so on... those numbers are also called "bit positions", and the algorithm defines those bit positions that are powers of two as the parity bits
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[05:50:43] so bit #0 is not a parity bit, bit #1 is not a parity bit, bit #2 is the first parity bit, bit #3 is not a parity bit, .... bit #8 is the second parity bit, and so on...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[05:50:51] no wait it starts from one
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[05:51:10] so bit #1 is not a parity bit, bit #2 is the first parity bit, bit #3 is not a parity bit, .... bit #8 is the second parity bit, and so on...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[05:51:25] no wait
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[05:52:11] the parity bits are powers of 2 remember? :)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[05:52:22] bit 1,2,4,8 ...
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[05:52:25] right powers of two (starting with the least significant bit) bit #1 is a parity bit, bit #2 is also a parity bit, but bit #3 is not a parity bit (its not a power of 2), but then bit #4 is a parity bit
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[05:52:55] right, what does it mean to "check" on of those bits?
2021-07-20 11:29:00	Izem	[05:53:41] let me see if I can draw something in text
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[05:53:45] to check on them you xor and if the xor is not zero then you know the corrupt bit (and also can correct it)
2021-07-20 11:29:00	beaky	[05:54:18] but if there's more than one corrupted bit then i think it doesnt correct it
