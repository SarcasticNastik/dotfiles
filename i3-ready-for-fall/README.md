## About
My dotfile organization repository! Contains config files for my current i3/Ubuntu setup. This is currently working in **Ubuntu 20.04**, but I assume it should work (with modification) on other distros.

## Notes
I'll have further instructions here about how to install everything. Until I get around that, note that:

- I'm using ibhagwan's picom fork, which can be installed from its repository. This is for rounded corners and dual-kawase blur.
- This is using Airblader's i3-gaps, not vanilla i3. I had to install this from a PPA for it to work, but I'd advise you to install it the conventional way for your distro.
- I found that Rofi needed to be built from source in order to get the latest icon functionality working.
- **The install script is very rudimentary.** It likely doesn't do all it needs to, and it probably overwrites files you may not want overwritten. I'd suggest manually:
    - installing `/config/` to `$CONFIG`
    - installing `/home/` to `$HOME`
    - installing `/scripts/` to `~/Scripts/`
    - following instructions inside each `/apps/` subdir

- Note that you don't really need to go through all that hodgepodge. Just define `homepage` to a custom page and go Î± on the browser.`
